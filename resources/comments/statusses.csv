I am no coward; still I have some regard for my life
 It is a present I
received from my parents and I wish to preserve it as long as possible
in remembrance of them
 So on my arrival at Athens in April 1856 I
refrained from going into the country
Had the director of the Hamburg Botanical Gardens said to me when I left
up a report on the remarkable system of brigandage obtaining in that
my American friends John Harris and William Lobster did
 But I had
merely been sent at a salary of £10 a month to collect the rarer
specimens of the flora of Greece
 I therefore began by studying the
native plants in the royal gardens; and put off the work of searching
for new species and varieties
John Harris and William Lobster who lodged with me at the shop of the
pastry cook Christodulos in Hermes Street were persons of a more
adventurous temperament
 Borrowing the only two horses that Christodulos
possessed they rode out into the country
 But they had scarcely gone a
mile when they were stopped by a band of brigands and urgently invited
to pay a visit to the King of the Mountains
 The Americans refused to
go as the King of the Mountains had an unkindly way of holding his
visitors to large ransoms and killing them if the money were not
quickly paid
 But the brigands--there were fourteen of them--insisted
and got out ropes and began to bind their captives
 Neither Harris nor
Lobster was made of the kind of wood of which faggots are composed
 They
drew their revolvers and used them with astonishing effect
 They lost
the horses but got safely back to Athens
served under Hadgi Stavros the King of the Mountains in the War of
Independence and earned enough money to set up in business
Then over a bottle of Santorin wine Christodulos related the story of
the great brigand chief
 Hadgi Stavros was by far the most popular
leader among the insurgent Greeks
 His hatred of the Turks did not blind
him to such a point that he passed through a Greek village without
plundering it
 A vigorous impartiality enabled him to advance his fame
by increasing his wealth
 Lord Byron dedicated an ode to him and
sympathisers with the Greek cause throughout Europe sent him subsidies
The result was that when Greece was at last liberated from the Turks
Hadgi Stavros returned to his old trade with a large capital and a
genius for organisation which enabled him to revolutionise the business
of brigandage
 He entered into arrangements with army officers and
politicians and saw to it that his allies were entrusted with the
government of his free enlightened and progressive country
Stavros is growing very old and has no son to succeed him
 For the sake
of his only daughter he is investing all his wealth in foreign stocks
and shares instead of using it to extend his business
Harris
now lying at the Piraeus in order to marry the richest heiress in
Greece
 Do you think it is worth getting captured for the sake of
As Christodulos was about to reply the shop-bell rang and a young lady
entered
 Like nine out of ten Athenian girls she had plain features
Her teeth were white and even and her hair was beautiful; but that was
all
 Happily in this world of ours the ugliest little goose generally
finds some honest gander to admire her
 Dimitri the son of the pastry
must not alarm this charming girl with tales about brigands
He then introduced Photini to us
 She was it appeared the daughter of
one of his old companions-in-arms Colonel John
 Colonel John was
apparently a man of means for Photini was very fashionably dressed and
she was being educated at the best boarding-school in Athens
 Her father
had asked his old friend to allow Photini to come and chat with us and
improve Her knowledge of French and German
 The girl however was too
timid to enter into conversation and to judge by the direction of her
glances it was not French or German that she would have liked to speak
if she could but English
John Harris I admit is a very good-looking man; but the way Photini
began to devour him with her eyes astonished me
 I was sitting next to
her at table; but she did not utter a word till the end of the meal
Then she asked if he were married
would be glad of an introduction to you
For something had occurred which made me suspect that she was the
richest heiress in Greece
 During the meal Dimitri came running in with
a newspaper and looking far from happy
camp and broken up his army and pursued him to the marshes of
Marathon
of the Mountains could take Athens if he wanted to and cut the throat
of every man in it
This I thought was strange language from an honest pastry cook who
was also a lieutenant in the militia
 I was still more surprised when I
turned to Photini and saw that her face was wet with tears
introduction you wanted
marry her to save my life

The next morning I strapped on my collecting-case and explored Mount
Parnassus
 There I came upon Dimitri and two ladies
 I'm their guide
 I chose this
excursion in the hope of meeting you
 But whatever is the matter with
They shrieked and stared horror-stricken at a clump of bushes
 I
looked in the same direction and perceived half a dozen gun-barrels
gleaming among the leaves
 Then eight ruffians appeared; and I saw that
the only difference between devils and brigands is that devils are less
black than is said and brigands much dirtier than is supposed
 They
took all our money and jewelery and then allowed Dimitri to depart--I
guessed why--and led the two ladies and myself down the hill and up a
winding path on to a high plateau where Hadgi Stavros and his band were
now encamped
The King of the Mountains was sitting cross-legged on a square carpet
beneath a pine-tree a little way from his noisy crowded camp
 Four
secretaries were writing on their knees to his dictation
 He was
undoubtedly a man of majestic appearance
 He had a fine figure--tall
supple and marvelously preserved--and calm noble features
 The only
indications of old age were his long white hair and long white
moustaches
 His dress was very simple--a jacket of black cloth immense
blue cotton trousers large boots of Russian leather and a loose red
cap
 A jeweled belt was the only costly thing he wore
He raised his head at our approach
while I finish dictating my letters
His servant brought us refreshments consisting of coffee Turkish
delight and preserved fruit
 Having put us at our ease the king went
on with his correspondence

Mrs

me

 I found more pleasure
in listening to the king's business correspondence
 It was
extraordinarily interesting
The next letter was addressed to George Micrommati Secretary of the

 It is I know the lowest dividend we have paid since the
company was formed fourteen years ago
 But the shareholders must
consider the difficulties we have had to struggle against
 Our business
is so closely connected with the interests of the country that it can
only flourish in times of general prosperity
 From those who have
nothing we can take nothing or very little
 The tourist season
however has opened very favourably and the affairs of the company
will I think soon improve
 I will send you a detailed statement in the
course of a few days
 I am too busy now
The king read over the letters and affixed his seal to them
 Then with
royal courtesy instead of having us brought before him on the carpet
he came and sat down by our side
 Mrs
 Simons at once began to talk at
him in English
 I offered to act as interpreter with a view to
protecting her from herself
 The king however thanked me coldly and
called to one of his brigands who knew English
As I had foreseen Mrs
 Simons spoke very largely about her great wealth
and her high position
 The result was that the king fixed her ransom and
that of Mary Ann at £4000
 I was determined that he should not
over-estimate my resources

 I've been forced to
leave home and come to Greece where I earn a beggarly £10 a month

 I want to go botanising

university I'll be bound
institution like the Hamburg Botanical Gardens would let a man of your
worth perish rather than pay his ransom of £600? Happy young man! You
now see the value of a sound scientific education
 Had you been an
utter ignoramus as I am I wouldn't have asked the ransom of a penny
The king listened neither to my objections nor to the cries of Mrs
Simons
 He rose up and departed; and one of his secretaries led us to a
plot of green sward where a meal had been laid for us
ill-mannered as to rob persons of your importance
 Everything they took
will be returned to you
 You have thirty days in which to pay your
ransom
 Write to your friends without delay as the king never grants an
extension of time
I did not know what to do
 I knew nobody with £100 much less £600
 Then
I thought of John Harris
 If he
will not intercede for me I leave myself dear friend in your hands
 I
know you are a man of courage and imagination
 You will find a way to
get me out of this fix
All the same I had very little hope; and Hadgi Stavros came up and
found me looking very gloomy

 Don't you understand? Here
you have an opportunity of winning a charming wife and an immense
fortune
Mary Ann was sitting with her mother outside one of the caves in the
rocky enclosure which were to serve as bedrooms
 Close at hand was a
stream which ran through a hole in the rocks and went tumbling down
the precipitous side of the plateau
 I saw that the stretch of green
sward between the rocks had been a lake
 This suggested to me a way of
escape

--A Way of Escape_
And so it proved
 Two days afterwards the king was explaining to me his
scheme for transforming brigandage into a peaceful orderly system of
taxation when four shots were fired in the distance

Sixty soldiers came marching into the camp
 Captain Pericles whose
figure I had often admired at Athens ran up to Hadgi Stavros and
kissed him

Guard the camp and write out the report of our battle
 Defeat me if you
like but leave ten of your best troops dead on the field

 Look after the three prisoners
 They're worth £4600
As Hadgi Stavros marched out at the head of his men they sang a song
composed by their king when he knew Lord Byron:
    Down the winding valleys a hillsman went his way;
      His eyes were black and flaming his gun was clean and bright
When Mrs
 Simons saw that the brigands had gone and the troops had
arrived she was wild with excitement
 I told her of the real state of
affairs; but she wouldn't believe me and gave Pericles her money and
jewels when asked for them
 In the evening the king returned with his
men and the troops departed
 Mrs
 Simons then broke down
she exclaimed
 and get Edward
to send our ransom
with your firm
 Do you remember the letter he was dictating when we
arrived? That was to Barley & Co
 about an investment
 Simons
once to your agents in Athens to send you £4600
 Pay Hadgi Stavros;
make him give you a receipt
 Enclose this in the next letter from
Messrs
 Barley & Co
 with the note--'Item
 £4600 personally remitted
by our partner Mrs
 Simons as per enclosed receipt
I raised my head and saw the sweet brown eyes of Mary Ann looking at
me radiant with joy
 I then went to Hadgi Stavros and explained that
the £4600 would be paid into his account at the Bank of Athens on the
production of his receipt for that amount
 He refused at first to give a
receipt
 He had never done such a thing
 Then I took him on his weak
side and said that perhaps it was more prudent not to give one
 If ever
he were captured it might be used against him
 This touched him
and Miss Simons one for Hermann Schultz
Alas! from my point of view the result was deplorable
 The ransom of the
two ladies was paid and they were set free
 But as Messrs
 Barley & Co
could not recover any money on a receipt given to me their agent
refused to pay my ransom
 Simons as she and Mary Ann departed
 Your first plan was
impossible with two women but now you are alone it is admirable
 Come
and see us as soon as you get away
That night I made friends with the ruffian set to watch over me and I
plied him with wine until he fell on the grass and was unable to rise
 I
then dammed the stream and climbed down its empty bed
 It was difficult
work as the rocks were wet and the night was very dark
 I was covered
with bruises when I reached a platform of rock about ten feet from the
bottom of the precipice
 Just as I was about to jump down a white form
appeared below and a savage growl came from it
 I had forgotten the
pack of fierce dogs which as the King of the Mountains had told me
were the best of all his sentries
 Happily I carried my collecting
case and in it was a packet of arsenic which I used for stuffing birds
I put some of the powder on a piece of bread and threw the poisoned
food to the dog; but arsenic takes a long time to act
 In about half an
hour's time the creature began to howl in a frightful manner and it did
not expire until daybreak
 It also succeeded in arousing the camp and I
was recaptured and brought before the king
you
 Were I to give way to my feelings I would have you killed
 But I
will be merciful
 You will merely be bastinadoed to prevent you from
wandering out of bounds until your ransom is paid
I received twenty strokes on my feet
 At the third I began to bleed
 At
the fourth I began to howl
 At the tenth I was insensible to pain
 When
I came to I was in such an agony that I would have given my soul to kill
Hadgi Stavros
 I tried to but failed
 But I would hurt him though I
knew I should die for it
 So with a torrent of invectives I explained
how I tricked him over the ransom of Mrs
 Simons and her daughter
will get back all the £4000 on your receipt
Hadgi Stavros turned pale and trembled
 You have not suffered
enough
 Four thousand pounds! It is a fortune
 You have stolen my
daughter's fortune
Then he left me in their hands
he dies before I begin to play with him
As a beginning they stripped me to the waist and their cook put me
close to a great fierce fire where some lambs were being fried
 The red
cinders fell about me and the heat was unsupportable
 I dragged myself
away on my hands--I could not use my feet--but the ruffian kicked me
back
 Then he left me for a moment to get some salt and pepper
 I
remembered that I had put the arsenic in my trousers pocket
 With a
supreme effort I rose up and scattered the powder over the meat
He had only seen from a distance the motion of my hand
 I was avenged!
son of Christodulos came running up
The cook was so astonished that he forgot me for a minute; and I managed
to crawl away and lay on the cold grass
 Then Hadgi Stavros appeared
With a cry of anguish he took me gently in his arms and carried me to
the cave among the rocks
I once had sixty strokes of the bastinado and two days afterwards I was
dancing the Romaika
 It was this ointment that cured me
assassin! If I only had you and your friend one in each hand! Oh he
The letter was from John Harris
 It ran:

harmed
 But I must return to Athens at once
 Get four of your men to
carry me down the mountains in a litter
The king rose up and then groaned and staggered
 I remembered the
arsenic
 He must have eaten some of the meat
 I tickled the inside of
his throat and he brought up most of the poison
 Soon afterwards the
other brigands came up to the enclosure screaming with pain and wanted
to murder me
 I had cast a spell over their meat and it was torturing
them they cried
 I must be killed at once and then the spell would be
removed
 The king commanded them to withdraw
 They resisted
 He drew his
saber and cut down two of the ringleaders
 The rest seized their guns
and began to shoot
 There were about sixty of them all suffering more
or less from the effects of arsenic poisoning
 We were only twelve in
number but our men had the steadier aim; and the king fought like a
hero though his hands and feet were swelling painfully
The fact was that he had eaten some time before his men and I could not
therefore get the poison completely out of his system
 But it was the
arsenic that saved his life
 He had at last to come and lie down beside
me
 We heard the sound of rapid firing in the distance; and suddenly two
men entered our enclosure with revolvers in each hand and shot down
our defenders with an extraordinary quickness of aim
 They were Harris
and Lobster
as he turned and found nothing more to shoot at
me
 There has been civil war in the camp
arsenic I had in my collecting case
My friends managed to carry me down the mountain and at the first
village we came to they got a carriage and took me to Athens
 The
ointment used by Hadgi Stavros was as he had said marvelous; and in
two days I could walk as well as ever
 I at once called on Mrs
 and Miss
Simons
to London
As I was returning to Hermes Street I met Hadgi Stavros and Photini
killed wounded or fled
 I might get others
 But look at my swollen
hands
 How can I use a sword? No; let some one younger now take my
place
 But I defy him to equal me in fame or fortune
 And I have not
done yet
 Before six months are gone you will see Hadgi Stavros Prime
Minister of Greece
And that was the last I saw of the King of the Mountains
 On the advice
of Harris I at once returned to Hamburg lest some of the remaining
brigands found me out and take vengeance for the spell I had cast on
their meat
 But some day I hope to go to London and call at 31

HARRISON AINSWORTH
Tower of London
     William Harrison Ainsworth born at Manchester England Feb
     4 1805 was a popular rather than a great writer
 A
     solicitor's son he was himself trained in the law but some
     adventures in journalism led him finally to the literary life
     his first success as a writer of romance being scored with
     the novelist and according to Ainsworth himself it was
     written chiefly with the aim of interesting his
     fellow-countrymen in the historical associations of the Tower
     From the popularity of the romance it is reasonable to suppose
     that it fulfilled its author's hopes in this respect though
     it must be confessed its history leaves a good deal to be
     desired
 Here is not the place to discuss the rights and
     wrongs of Ainsworth's bold liberties in respect to the
     historical personages he introduces; but there is no doubt
     that the romance is told with vigour and dramatic movement
     and it is an excellent example of the novelist's spirited
     style of narrative though judged on purely literary merits
     comparison with the masterpieces of Sir Walter Scott in the
     field of historical romance
 Ainsworth died at Reigate on
     January 3 1882
_I
--Prisoners in the Tower_
Edward VI
 was dead poisoned it was rumoured by the Duke of
Northumberland Grandmaster of the Realm
 For three days had an attempt
been made to keep his death secret so that the proud and ambitious duke
might seize the persons of the Princess Mary and the Princess Elizabeth
But the former warned in time had escaped the snare; and the Duke of
Northumberland finding further dissimulation useless boldly proclaimed
his daughter-in-law Lady Jane Grey queen
On July 10 1553 Queen Jane the wisest and most beautiful woman in the
kingdom though only sixteen years of age was conducted in state to the
Tower where it was the custom for the monarchs of England to spend the
first few days of their reign
But the crowds who watched her departure from Durham House in the
Strand were silent and sullen
 Her youthful beauty and grace might win
an involuntary cry of admiration but the heart of the people was not
hers
 They recognised that she was but the tool of her father-in-law
whom because of his overweening ambition they hated
All the pride and pomp of silken banners and cloth of gold could not
mask the gloomy presage of the young queen's reign
 The very heavens
thundered; and owing to the press of boats that surrounded the
procession many small craft were overturned and their occupants thrown
into the water
 And if further signs of portending evil were wanted
they could be discerned in the uneasy whisperings of those lords of the
Privy Council who were present or in the sinister face of the Spaniard
Simon Renard ambassador to the Emperor Charles V
ambassador
through them I shall strike the scepter from Jane's grasp and place it
in the hand of Mary
Elsewhere in the procession Cranmer Archbishop of Canterbury uttered
in a low voice to Ridley Bishop of London his fears for the future;
while certain lords of the Privy Council who had planned the
assassination of the Duke of Northumberland and were aware that their
plot had been discovered approached the portals of the Tower in fear
and trembling
But there was one man at least who did not share the general depression
and uneasiness
 Cuthbert Cholmondeley esquire to Lord Guildford Dudley
husband of Queen Jane found much to interest him in the scene
 The
reception of her Majesty by Og Gog and Magog had already driven away
the sense of portending evil from his mind when he caught sight of a
girl's face in the crowd
 It was only for a moment that he had sight of
it; but it left such a deep impression on his mind that for the rest of
the day he burned with impatience to discover who the girl might be
Much had to happen before he could satisfy his curiosity
 Once in the
Tower plots against Queen Jane and the Duke of Northumberland began to
thicken
 At a meeting of the Privy Council the duke compelled the lords
under threat of imprisonment to sign a proclamation declaring Princess
Mary illegitimate
 Renard lost no time in turning to his own advantage
the bad impression created by these tactics
Pembroke
This sinister fragment of conversation fell upon the ears of Cuthbert
He at once sent a warning missive to his master telling him of the plot
against the duke's life
 Then this duty performed he set out to try
and find the girl whose face had so impressed him
 From the giant
warders he learnt that she was the adopted daughter of Dame Potentia
Trusbut wife of Peter the pantler of the Tower
 A mystery surrounded
her birth
 Her mother had been imprisoned in the Tower by Henry VIII

and in her dungeon had given birth to Cicely--such was the name of the
girl
Magog seeing Cuthbert's interest good-naturedly carried him off with
him to the pantler's quarters
 Here a gargantuan feast was in progress
to which the three giants did full justice devouring whole joints and
pasties and quaffing vast flagons of wine to the great delight of the
pantler and his wife
 But Cuthbert had no eyes except for Cicely
 He was
not content until he was by her side and was able to hear her voice
 The
attraction between them was mutual and it was not long before they were
whispering the first words of love into one another's ears
While all was merriment Renard and Pembroke made their appearance
unobserved
 They had intercepted Cuthbert's letter and were anxious to
satisfy themselves as to the identity of the rash youth who had dared to
cross their path
 He must not return to the palace
 He has supplanted
me but he shall not profit by his good fortune
gleefully
The three withdrew unobserved
 Half an hour later Cuthbert dragged
himself unwillingly from Cicely's side and passed into the open air
 As
he did so he received a blow on the back of his head which stretched him
unconscious on the ground
When he came to his senses he found himself bound by a chain in a gloomy
dungeon a ghastly dreadful place but a few feet in height
 His first
instinct was to try to loosen his bonds but after vainly lacerating his
hands he sank down exhausted
Terrible recollections flashed upon his mind of the pitiless sufferings
he had heard that the miserable wretches immured in these dungeons
endured before death
For a time these mental tortures were acute; but at last nature asserted
herself and he sank exhausted into sleep
 He was awakened by a cry and
perceived the tall skeleton figure of a woman standing by him
 She
placed a thin and bony hand upon his shoulder
 He shrank back as far as
his chain would permit horror-stricken
 The figure pursued him
Suddenly she stopped and stood erect
 A distant footstep was heard
dungeon and disappeared
In another second Nightgall stood before him
 The gaoler made no attempt
to disguise the motives which prompted him to imprison the young
esquire
 No threats that Cuthbert could use had the least effect on him
He quailed before the charge that Cuthbert made at random--that he had
murdered the child of the unfortunate wretch who had disappeared at his
coming but on the question of his release he was obdurate
 If Cuthbert
would agree to give up Cicely he should be released; otherwise he should
meet with a secret death at the hands of Mauger the executioner
At this juncture Cicely who had been directed by the dwarf Xit
appeared
 To save the man she loved she boldly declared that she would
wed Nightgall provided that he would conduct his prisoner outside the
walls of the Tower
said
Nightgall consented and agreed to withdraw while Cuthbert and Cicely
arranged privately what the token should be
Hurriedly Cuthbert gave her a ring to send to Lord Dudley who he knew
would at once effect his release
 Then accompanied by Nightgall Cicely
withdrew from the gloomy dungeon
Unable to deliver the ring herself to Lord Dudley Cicely entrusted that
task to Xit
 But the vanity of the dwarf prevented the execution of the
plan
 As he was exhibiting the ring to Og Nightgall suddenly
approached and snatched it from him and without taking any notice of
the little man's threats made his way to Cicely
 When he displayed the
ring as the token that her lover had been set free Cicely shrieking
_II
--The Twelfth Day Queen_
While Renard's intrigues were maturing and the Duke of Northumberland
had left the Tower on a campaign against the Princess Mary Cuthbert
Cholmondeley was kept languishing in his terrible dungeon
At long intervals Nightgall visited him and once the wretched prisoner
whom the gaoler called Alexia came to him entreating his help against
Nightgall
At last Cuthbert decided upon a daring plan of escape
 After several
days' imprisonment he feigned to be dead
 Nightgall seeing him
stretched on the ground apparently lifeless chuckled with delight
and releasing the chain that bound his leg bent over him with the
intention of carrying his body into the burial vault near the moat
 But
a suspicion crossed his mind and he drew his dagger determined to make
sure that his prisoner had passed away
 As he did so the young esquire
sprang to his feet and wrested the poniard from his grasp
 In another
second Nightgall was lying chained to the floor where his prisoner had
been a moment before
Despite the gaoler's threats Cuthbert set out determined to liberate
Alexia and made good his own escape
 He wandered through the terrible
torture chambers released an old man confined in a cell called Little
Ease a cell so low and so contrived that the wretched inmate could not
stand walk sit or lie at full length within and then unable to
discover the whereabouts of the ill-fated Alexia returned to the
gaoler and possessing himself of his keys and cloak started forth
once more
 After wandering for a long time chance at last brought him
to a secret door which led into St
 John's Chapel in the White Tower
While these events were in progress Cicely despairing of her lover's
safety sought an audience of Queen Jane and poured out her story
Moved by compassion the queen gave directions for a search to be made
and delighted by the grace and charm of Cicely appointed her one of
her attendants
 Lord Guildford Dudley procuring the assistance of
Magog burst open the door leading to the subterranean dungeons beneath
the Devilin Tower and eventually discovered Nightgall who made a full
confession of his crime as the price of his release
Cholmondeley's arrival in St
 John's Chapel was opportune
 Renard with
Pembroke by his side had just demanded the resignation of the crown by
Queen Jane and the queen helpless but courageous had ordered Lord
Pembroke to arrest the Spaniard
 Pembroke had refused to move and at
this juncture Cholmondeley stepped forward and advancing towards the
 Simon Renard you are the queen's prisoner
The Spaniard drew his sword and with the assistance of the Earl of
Pembroke kept Cuthbert at bay until they were both able to slip through
the secret door
Next day Queen Jane was forced by the Privy Council to resign her
crown and that same night accompanied by Cuthbert and Cicely she
escaped by a secret passage from the Tower and taking a boat made her
way to Sion House
 Here the following day she and her husband were
arrested and learnt the news that the Duke of Northumberland was in
captivity and that Queen Mary had ascended the throne
 Once more Lady
Jane was led back to the Tower and as she entered by the Traitors' Gate
she saw Renard standing hard by with a smile of bitter mockery in his
face
 The Twelfth Day Queen has played her
part
_III
--The Price of Pardon_
Simon Renard's influence was now for the time supreme
 At his
instigation the Duke of Northumberland was tricked into a confession of
the Roman Catholic faith on the scaffold and then executed
 Ambitious
that Mary should marry Philip of Spain he contrived by intrigue to kill
her affection for Courtenay the young Earl of Devon and succeeded so
successfully that Courtenay was placed under arrest and the Princess
Elizabeth with whom the earl had fallen in love became the victim of
her sister's jealousy
 Cuthbert though not confined in a cell was kept
prisoner in the Tower and occupied quarters in the pantler's house
Cicely had disappeared and nothing had been heard of her since the
arrest of Lady Jane Grey at Sion House
Consumed with anxiety for the safety of the girl he loved the esquire
began to suspect that she had been kidnapped by Nightgall
 He determined
to find her at all cost and getting Xit to steal the gaoler's keys he
once more made his way to the subterranean dungeons
Cell after cell he searched but nowhere could he find a trace of his
beloved Cicely
 All that he discovered was the dead body of Alexia
 He
made haste to return to his quarters and had almost reached them when
Nightgall appeared and at once placed him under arrest for stealing his
keys
His enemy was now at his mercy and Nightgall after burying the body of
Alexia sought out Cicely whom be had kept for several weeks a close
prisoner in the Salt Tower
 He told her that he was about to remove her
to another prison in the Tower leading to the Iron Gate
terrified from him
your bride
never be set free unless you consent to be mine
He carried her shrieking and struggling in his arms out of the room
and dragged her by main force down the secret staircase
 She continued
her screams until her head striking against the stones she was
stunned by the blow and became insensible
 Nightgall raised her and
carried her quickly to the dark cell he had already prepared
 Here she
would have languished for months without seeing anybody save Nightgall
except for a curious chain of circumstances
Renard's plan of marrying Mary to Philip of Spain to which end he had
had Courtenay and the Princess Elizabeth imprisoned in the Tower was
bitterly opposed by De Noailles
 The French ambassador determined to
prevent the Spaniard's plans and by means of Xit sent a communication
to the princess just as she was leaving her prison for Ashbridge
Further the little mannikin managed to creep by way of the chimney
into the chamber where Courtenay was confined and arrange a plan by
which the Earl was able to escape
 His share in these events however
was discovered and much to his amazement he was arrested and taken to
the torture chamber
 Though none of the instruments were small enough to
inflict much pain upon him he was so terrified that he answered every
question that Renard asked him giving those answers that he thought the
Spaniard would approve
 The examination over he was placed in a cell
Here he was visited by Nightgall from whose girdle he managed to cut
unobserved the bunch of keys
Unlocking his own door he hurried out into the labyrinth of passages
and cells and in his wanderings in search of an exit lighted upon the
cell in which Cicely was confined
 He was not able to effect her escape
for as they were setting out Nightgall appeared and put an end to their
hopes
Cuthbert had meanwhile been released together with Lady Jane and her
husband
 For a time they lived together quietly in Sion House but De
Noailles' plan to prevent the Spanish marriage at all costs dragged them
once more into the whirlpool
Under the leadership of Sir Thomas Wyatt an insurrection took place
having for its nominal object the prevention of Mary's marriage with
Philip of Spain; but it was joined by all the forces opposed to the
crown
 Courtenay shared in it because he hoped to wed Elizabeth who
would be made Queen on the deposition of Mary
 Lord Guildford Dudley
joined in it in the anticipation that his wife might once more mount the
throne
At first Wyatt carried everything before him
 Mary was actually besieged
in the Tower which it was attempted to carry by force
 Supported by
succeeded when Dudley was struck from behind by Renard and taken
prisoner
Cuthbert only escaped by forcing himself through an aperture and
dropping into the moat from where he managed to swim ashore
 He made
his way at once to Lady Jane and related to her how the insurrection
had collapsed and how her husband had been taken prisoner
 For her own
safety Jane had no thought
 She at once determined to seek out the
queen and beseech her to spare her husband
Accompanied by Cuthbert she presented herself at the Tower and
obtaining an audience with Mary flung herself at her feet
as she could find utterance
mercy
 I have
come to offer myself for him
 If your highness has any pity for me
extend it to him and heap his faults on my head
Queen Mary was deeply moved
 Had not Gardiner intervened she would
undoubtedly have granted the request; but Gardiner suggested that the
price of the pardon should be the public reconciliation of Lady Jane and
her husband with the Church of Rome
alive
_IV
--The Torture Chamber and the Block_
After a week's imprisonment Cuthbert was closely questioned and his
answers being deemed unsatisfactory he was ordered to be examined under
torture
 With fiendish delight Nightgall took him to the horrible
chamber
 There the first thing that he saw was the tortured mangled
figure of Lord Dudley covered from head to foot by a blood-coloured
cloth
obtaining your pardon
anguish as he was carried from the room
 Oh
Cholmondeley as soon as his master had been borne away was seized by
the torturers and placed on the rack
 He determined that not a sound
should escape him and though his whole frame seemed rent asunder he
bravely kept his resolve
again
Even as he spoke Cholmondeley fainted and finding that no answers
could be extracted from him he was taken back to his cell and flung
upon a heap of straw
 As he lay there Nightgall with diabolical
cruelty brought Cicely to his side and bade her look on his nerveless
arms and crippled limbs and mockingly offered to set him free if Cicely
would marry him of her own free will
 When at Cuthbert's instigation she
refused he forced her away shrieking for help
Cuthbert sank once more into insensibility
 He came to his senses again
to find that men were chafing his limbs and bathing his temples and
that Renard was in his cell
 At the Spaniard's order he was given a cup
of wine and the rest having withdrawn Renard questioned him further
While this examination was going on the cell door opened softly and a
masked figure appeared
 It was Nightgall who bribed by De Noailles
had come to assassinate Renard
 He flung himself on his intended victim
and was about to dispatch him with his poniard when Cuthbert summoning
up all his strength intervened
Finding that he had two men to deal with instead of one the gaoler
sprang to his feet and rushed from the dungeon
 Renard followed him
furious with rage and Cuthbert at once took advantage of the
opportunity to escape
After some search he discovered the whereabouts of Cicely and together
the lovers happy once more at being united if only for a short time
succeeded in finding their way out of the dungeons
 As soon as they
emerged into the open air they were arrested by the warders and taken
to the guard-room in the White Tower where Cicely received a warm
welcome from the three giants
 There was no time to relate their
adventures before Renard appeared walking before a litter upon which
was borne the mangled body of Nightgall who in his attempt to escape
the Spaniard's sword had been forced to jump from an embrasure of the
White Tower
The wretch was dying; but with his last breath he attempted to make some
amends for all the evil he had done in his life
 Bidding Cicely come to
his side he told her that she was the daughter of Alexia whose real
name was Lady Mountjoy and he gave her papers proving her right to the
estates of her father Sir Alberic Mountjoy who had incurred the
vengeance of Henry VIII
Renard grateful to Cholmondeley for saving his life secured his
pardon
Cicely also returned to the side of Lady Jane Grey and watched the
splendid fortitude and unswerving courage with which her unfortunate
mistress prepared for the scaffold
 The day before her death her wish
that Cicely and Cuthbert should be united was granted and they were
married in her presence by Master John Bradford Prebendary of St
Paul's
At last Monday the twelfth of February 1544 dawned and Lady Jane
Grey was led out to the scaffold
 On the way she passed the headless
corpse of Lord Guildford being borne to the grave
 Cicely accompanied
the beautiful girl to the last
 It was her hands that helped her to
remove her attire and that tied the handkerchief over those eyes which
were never to look on the world again
She was guided to the place and laying her head on the block cried
The axe then fell and one of the fairest and wisest heads that ever sat
on human shoulders fell also

HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN
The Improvisatore
     Hans Christian Andersen was born at Odense in Denmark on
     April 2 1805 the son of a poor bootmaker
 His life was full
     of exciting incidents; his early years in particular
     constitute a record of hard struggle poverty and lack of
     recognition
 When nine he tried his hand at tragedy and
     comedy and was sent after his father's death in 1819 to
     Copenhagen where he engaged in various occupations with
     little success until his talents attracted the attention of a
     few influential personages who provided him with the means
     for continuing his studies
 He won considerable reputation
     with some early poems and was quite well known to the public
     before he entered the university in 1828
 He next published a
     satirical story and after a journey in Italy his famous
     a brilliant series of word-pictures describing the life and
     character of the parts of Italy he had visited
 Apart from his
     world-famous fairy tales by which he set no great store
     being ambitious of fame as a novelist he wrote several
     successful plays epic poems and novels
 His fairy tales have
     been translated practically into every language
 Hans Andersen
     died at the age of seventy in Copenhagen on August 4 1875
_I
--A Boyhood in Rome_
My earliest recollections take me back to my tender youth when I lived
with my widowed mother in a little garret in a Roman square
 She
supported us by sewing and by the rent of a larger room sublet to a
young painter
 On the house opposite there was an image of the Virgin
before which when the evening bells rang I and the neighbours'
children used to kneel and sing in honour of the Mother of God and the
Child Jesus
 Once an English family stopped to listen; and the gentleman
My mother's confessor Fra Martino always showed great kindness to me;
and I spent many hours with him at the convent
 It was through him that
I became chorister in the Capuchin church and was allowed to carry the
great censer
Before I was nine I was chosen as one of the boys and girls who were to
preach between Christmas and the New Year in the church of Ara Croeli
before the image of Jesus
 I had no fear and it seemed decided that I
of all children gave most delight; but after me came a little girl of
exquisitely delicate form bright countenance and so melodious a voice
that even my mother with all her pride of me awarded her the palm and
declared that she was just like an angel
 But I had often to repeat my
speech at home and then made up a new one describing the festival in
the church which was considered just as good
One moonlit evening on returning with my mother from a visit in
Trastevere we found a crowd in the Piazza di Trevi listening to a man
singing to a guitar--not songs like those which I had so often heard
but about things around him of what we saw and heard and we ourselves
were in the song
 My mother told me he was an improvisatore; and
Federigo our artist lodger told me I should also improvise for I was
really a poet
 And I tried it forthwith--singing about the foodshop over
the way with its attractively set out window and the haggling
customers
 I gained much applause; and from this time forth I turned
everything into song
My first visit to the country ended in a sad event which was to shape
the whole course of my life
 It was in June and my mother and her
friend Mariuccia took me to see the famous flower fête at Genzano
 We
stayed the night at an inn and in the morning joined the dense holiday
crowd that moved over the carpet of flowers on the pavement of the main
street
 Suddenly there was a piercing cry--a pair of unmanageable horses
rushed through
 I was thrown down and all was blackness
 When I awoke
Mother of God I lay with my head on Mariuccia's lap beside the
lifeless form of my mother crushed by the carriage wheel! The occupant
of the carriage a gentleman of the Borghese family had escaped with a
shaking and sent a servant in rich livery with a purse containing
twenty scudi for the motherless child
Mariuccia took me back to Rome; it was decided that her parents who
kept flocks in the Campagna--honest people to whom my twenty scudi would
be wealth--should take charge of me
 Thus in the dreary Campagna with
honest Benedetto and kindly Domenica I spent the summer and the early
autumn in the ancient tomb which they had transformed into a hut
 The
first week it rained incessantly; then with the sun came the
insufferable heat increasing in intensity from day to day from week to
week
 Even the buffaloes lay like dead masses upon the burnt-up grass
unless excited to madness by the poison-stings of myriads of flies
that covered them as if they were carrion they rushed in mad career to
the Tiber to roll themselves in the yellow water
One day towards sunset I was just opening the door to leave the hut
when a man darted in so suddenly that I was thrown down
 With lightning
speed he shut the door and in a distressed tone uttered the name of the
Madonna when a violent blow shattered the door and the whole opening
was filled with the head of a fierce buffalo whose body was tightly
squeezed into the doorway
 The stranger seized a gun from the wall took
aim and shot the beast
 The danger over he lifted me from the ground
about me
 I was made to show him my abominable sketches upon bits of
paper and to sing to him and caused him astonishment at my improvising
about the Madonna and himself and the buffalo
 He finally asked Domenica
to bring me next morning to see him at the Borghese Palace
 He was the
powerful prince himself who had unwittingly been the cause of my poor
mother's death!
_II
--In the School of Life_
The prince his daughter Francesca and her fiance Fabiani overwhelmed
me with kindness
 The visit had to be frequently repeated; and I became
quite accustomed to the splendours of the palazzo
 Finally Eccellenza
decided to have me educated in the Jesuits' school; and I had to bid
farewell to good Domenica and to enter upon my school life
 New
occupations engrossed me; new acquaintances presented themselves; the
dramatic portion of my life began to unfold itself
 Here years compress
themselves together
I became particularly attached to one of my school-fellows Bernardo a
gay almost dissolute son of a Roman senator
 When he suddenly left
school to join the Papal Guard the whole world seemed to me empty and
deserted
 One day I saw him pass my window on a prancing horse
 I rushed
out but ran across the porter's wife of the Borghese Palace who
informed me that the young Eccellenza and her husband had just arrived
Would I not come to give them welcome? To the palace I went was
graciously received by Fabiani and Francesca who brought me their
been destined from her birth for the life of a nun
 The child had
wonderfully bright eyes and came towards me as though we were old
acquaintances laughing and chattering and showing me her toys
On my way back early in the evening as luck would have it I almost
ran into the arms of Bernardo
 He was delighted to see me told me of
his merry life and adventures and wanted to drag me into an artists'
tavern to drink a bottle of wine
 That was impossible for me a Jesuits'
pupil
 I refused
 As we walked on we met a crowd hustling an old Jew
 A
thick-set brute of a fellow wanted to force him to jump over a long
snatched the stick out of the fellow's hand brandished his sword and
flat of his sword
 The crowd veered round at once laughed and
applauded the old Jew meanwhile making his escape
drink a bottle of wine with you
I met Bernardo again some time after at the Vatican
 His joy equalled
mine and he immediately plunged into confidences
 One day when
straying into the Ghetto he had encountered the old Jew of our
adventure bowing and scraping and requesting the honour of receiving
him in his house
 They entered; wine was brought to him by a dark Jewish
maiden of such beauty as to set his whole blood on fire
 Since then he
had vainly tried to see her
 He visited the Jew's house on all sorts of
pretexts but his charmer remained invisible
 He now made the amazing
proposition that I should take up the study of Hebrew with the old Jew
and thus help him in this affair
 I explained the utter impossibility of
aiding him in a project of this nature
 He was obviously offended; and
when we parted he returned my warmth with chilly politeness
We met but rarely after this meeting; Bernardo was always jovial and
friendly though not confidential until on the occasion of a dance at
the Borghese Palace when I asked him about the handsome Jewish maiden
he laughed
bird
My patron's family left Rome; and I had to throw myself into the study
for the examination that was to bring me the title of an abbé
 With the
advent of the carnival I had assumed the black dress and the short silk
coat of an abbate and had become a new and happier person
 For the
first time I took part in the jollities of the carnival and at the end
of the first day again came across Bernardo who insisted upon taking me
to the opera to hear a new prima donna who had turned everybody's heart
at Naples
 Rumour had not belied her
 Her appearance was greeted with
rapturous applause
 Bernardo seized my arm; he had recognised in her his
child who had preached that Christmas at Ara Coeli
 There were endless
thrown at her feet and among them a little poem which I had written
under the inspiration of her exquisite voice
 With a crowd of
enthusiasts we hurried to the stage-door took the horses from her
carriage and conducted her in triumph to her apartments
Bernardo who bolder than I had called on Annunciata brought me to
her the next day
 She was friendly brilliant in her conversation and
immortality first of eternal Rome and then of the fair singer's art--to
which I was pressed when Bernardo let out the secret of my gift
confidingly into my eyes
 I ventured to kiss her hand
 After that I saw
her every day during the gay carnival and was more and more captivated
by her charm
Annunciata left Rome on Ash Wednesday and with her the brightness
seemed to have gone completely out of my life my only pleasure being
the recollection of those happy days of the carnival
_III
--Love and Adventure in Rome_
I saw Annunciata again when Rome had begun to fill with Easter visitors
and had the happiness of dining with her the same day
 She told me that
although born in Spain she had been as a child in Rome; that it was
perished of hunger had not a despised Jew given it shelter and food
until it could flutter forth over the wild restless sea
showed her over the Borghese gallery; and on the day before Easter we
drove out to see the procession which initiated the Easter festival and
in the evening to Monte Mario to see the illuminations of St
 Peter's--
an unforgettable sight!
As I went into the little inn to fetch some refreshment I found myself
in the narrow passage face to face with Bernardo pale and with glowing
eyes
I tried to calm him but he forced a pistol into my hand
 I thrust him
back
 I heard a report; my hand trembled
 Bernardo lay before me in his
blood
 The people of the house rushed in and with them Annunciata
 I
wanted to fling myself in despair upon Bernardo's body; but Annunciata
lay on her knees beside him trying to staunch the blood
innocent; the pistol went off by accident
 Yes Annunciata we loved
you
 I would die for you like he! Which of us was the dearer to you?
Tell me whether you love me and then I will escape
down to the dead
 I heard her weeping and saw her press her lips to
Bernardo's brow
invisible hands I was torn out of the house
Like a madman I rushed through bushes and underwood until I reached the
Tiber
 Among the ruins of a tomb I came across three men sitting around
a fire to whom I explained that I wanted a boat to cross the river
They agreed to take me across; but I had better give them my money to
keep for safety
 I realised that I had fallen into the hands of robbers
gave them all I had was tied on to a horse and taken across the river
riding all night until at dawn we reached a wild part of the mountains
They wanted to keep me for ransom and dispatched one of their number to
Rome to find out all he could about me
 The man returned; and with a
thankful heart I heard that Bernardo was only wounded and on the way to
recovery
My rough hosts having found out my gift I was asked to sing to them;
and once more my power of improvisation stood me in good stead
 When I
had finished a wrinkled old woman who seemed to be held in great
reverence by the robbers came towards me
she exclaimed
detained six days during which there were mysterious comings and
goings
 The old witch herself who had made me write on a piece of paper
came back with a letter which she commanded me not to read then
Finally in the midst of night she led me out of the robbers' den and
took me across a rocky path to a dumb peasant with an ass which I was
made to mount
 She kissed my forehead and departed
 When daylight broke
I opened the letter which contained a passport in my name an order for
danger but do not return to Rome for some months
When I joined the high-road I took carriage for Naples
 Among my
travelling companions was a portly handsome Neapolitan lady with whom
I became very friendly and who invited me to her house
 She was the
wife of a Professor Maretti and her name was Santa
 The professor
himself was a little half-famished looking man full of learning by the
show of which he was in the habit of boring everybody who came near him
Santa made up for this by her liveliness and her warm interest in my
affairs
 Amid music and laughter I spent many happy hours in her house
made friends and was encouraged to make my début as an improvisatore
 I
had written to Eccellenza a true account of the reason of my departure
and informed him of my future intentions; but his reply which arrived
after long delay was a stunning blow to me
 He was exceedingly annoyed
washed his hands of me and wished me not on any account to connect his
name with my public life
_IV
--On the Road to Fame_
The bitterness of my misery was brought home to me with new force when I
saw Bernardo at a gambling saloon in the company of a handsome woman of
doubtful reputation
 That Annunciata should have preferred this fickle
man to me! My debut at San Carlo aroused great enthusiasm and Santa
whom I saw next day in her snug heavily curtained room seemed radiant
with happiness at my success
 She made me sit on a soft silken sofa
stroked my head and spoke of my future
 I kissed her hand and looked
into her dark eyes with a purity of soul and thought
 She was greatly
excited
 I saw her bosom heave violently; she loosened a scarf to
breathe more freely
lips were like fire that flowed into my very soul!
Eternal Mother of God! The holy image at that moment fell down from
the wall
 It was no mere accident
rushed out of the house determined never to set eyes upon Santa again
The sea air would cool me
 I took a boat to Torre del Annunciata; and
happiness gradually returned to me as I realised what danger I had
escaped by the grace of the Virgin
I joined the crowd watching the fiery stream of lava slowly descending
towards the sea when I heard somebody calling my name
 It was Fabiani
who insisted on taking me at once to see Francesca
 The welcome was
hearty
 There were no recriminations although I resented for a while
the tone of benevolent patronage adopted by my benefactors
 I learnt
that Bernardo had entered the King of Naples' service and that
Annunciata was shortly expected
 An expedition was arranged to Pæstum
and Capri; and Fabiani insisted upon my joining the party
 He also
undertook to write to his father-in-law on my behalf
At Pæstum we found the abundance and luxuriance of Sicilian landscape;
its Grecian temples and its poverty
 We were surrounded by crowds of
half-naked beggars
 One young girl there was a little away from the
others scarcely more than eleven years old but lovely as the goddess
of beauty
 Modesty soul and a deep expression of suffering were
expressed in her countenance
 She was blind! I gave her a scudo
 Her
cheeks burned
 She kissed my hand; and the touch seemed to go through my
blood
 The guide told us afterwards that her name was Lara and that she
generally sat in the Temple of Neptune
The ruined temple made a mighty impression upon us; I was requested to
improvise in these romantic surroundings
 Deeply moved by my thoughts of
the blind girl I sang of the glories of Nature and art and of the poor
maiden from whom all this magnificence was concealed
 When we left the
temple I lagged behind and looking around I saw Lara on her knees
her hands clasped together
 She had heard my song! It smote me to the
soul
 I saw her pressing my scudo to her lips and smile; I grew quite
warm at the sight of it and pressed a hot kiss upon her forehead
 With
a thrilling cry she sprang up like a terrified deer and was gone
 I
felt as if I had committed a sin and sadly joined my party
Amalfi Capri--I drank the intoxicating beauty of it all
 Then I was
prevailed upon to return to Rome with Fabiani and Francesca
 We spent a
day at Naples where I found two letters waiting for me
 The first was a
and kindly towards you expects you this evening
moment of our parting is now well over
 Come quickly! Delay not a moment
My mind was made up not to see her again
 We left for Rome
The Palazzo Borghese was now my home
 Eccellenza received me with the
greatest kindness but all the family continued to use the old teaching
tone and depreciating mode of treatment
 Thus six years went by; but
somehow my protectors did not realise that I was no longer a boy and my
dependence gave them the right to make them let me feel the bitterness
of my position
 Even my talent as poet and improvisatore was by no means
taken seriously at the palace
taking the veil
 She had grown tall and pale of complexion with an
expression of wonderful gentleness in her features
 She recalled our
early friendship when she used to sit on my knee and make me draw
pictures for her and tell her stories
 From her at any rate I suffered
no humiliation and from day to day our friendship grew closer
 I told
her about Bernardo and Annunciata and about Lara who became
inexpressibly dear to her
 I also endeavoured to make her reconsider her
decision to take the veil and immure herself for life; but her whole
education and inclination tended towards that goal
 At last the day
itself came--a day of great solemnity and state
 Flaminia was dead and
buried--and Elizabeth the nun the bride of Heaven arose from the bier!
_V
--The Sorrowful Wayfarer_
In my sadness of heart I thought of my childhood and old Domenica whom
I had not seen for many months
 I went out to the Campagna
 Domenica had
died six months back! When I returned I was seized by a violent fever
from which I recovered but slowly
 It was six months after Flaminia had
taken the veil that the doctor allowed me to go out
My first walk was to the grey convent where she now passed her
monotonous days
 Every evening I returned and often I stood gazing at
her prison and thinking of Flaminia as I used to know her
 One evening
Fabiani found me thus and made me follow him home
 He spoke to me with
unusual solemnity in his voice but with great kindness
 I was ill
Travelling change of scene would do me good
 I was to move about for a
year and then return to show what the world had made of me
I went to Venice
 Dreary sad and quiet seemed to me the Queen of the
Adriatic
 In the gently swaying gondola I thought with bitterness of
Annunciata
 I felt a grudge even against innocent pious Flaminia who
preferred the convent to my strong brotherly love
 Then my thoughts
floated between Lara the image of beauty and Santa the daughter of
sin
One day I took a boat to the Lido to breathe the fresh air of the sea
On the beach I came across Poggio a young Venetian nobleman with whom I
had made friends; and as a storm hung threatening in the sky I decided
to accept his invitation for dinner
 We watched the fury of the storm
from the window and then joined a crowd of women and children anxiously
watching a fishing boat out at sea
 Before our very eyes the boat was
swallowed by the waves and with aching hearts we witnessed the prayers
shrieks and despair of the anxious watchers whose husbands and fathers
perished thus within their sight
Next evening there was a reception at my banker's
 The storm became a
topic of conversation; and Poggio related the death of the fishermen
trying to enlist sympathy for the poor survivors
 But nobody seemed to
understand his intention
 Then I was asked to improvise
 I was quickly
determined
happiness in everybody and I have the power of exciting it in every
heart
 But this art cannot be given it must be purchased
 He who gives
most will be most deeply initiated
forthcoming; and I began to sing of the proud sea and the bold mariners
and fishermen
 I described what I had seen; and my art succeeded where
Poggio's words had failed
 A tumult of applause arose
 A young lady sank
at my feet seized my hand and with her beautiful tear-filled eyes
gave me a look of intense gratitude which agitated me in strange
fashion
 Then she withdrew as if in horror at what she had done
Poggio afterwards told me that she was the queen of beauty in Venice
the podestà's niece adored by everybody but known by few since the
podestà's house was most exclusive and received but few guests
 He
accounted me the luckiest of mortals when he heard that I had received
an invitation from the podestà and would have a chance of improving my
acquaintance with Maria his beautiful niece
 I was received as if I had
been a beloved relative
 Something in Maria's expression recalled to me
the blind beggar-girl Lara; but Maria had eyes with a singularly dark
glance of fire
 I became a daily visitor at the podestà's house and
spent many happy hours in Maria's company
 Her intellect and charm of
character captivated me as much as her beauty
_VI
--A Marriage in Venice_
One evening I strayed into a wretched little theatre where one of
Mercadante's operas was being performed
 How can I describe my feelings
when in one of the singers--a slight ordinary figure with a thin
sharp countenance and deeply sunken eyes in a poor dress and with a
poorer voice but still with surprising grace of manner--I recognised
Annunciata? With aching heart I left the theatre and ascertained
Annunciata's address
 She lived in a miserable garret
 She turned
deathly pale when she recognised me and implored me to leave her
robbed her of her youth her voice her money her friends
 She implored
me with a pitiful voice to leave her
 I could not speak
 I pressed her
Next day I called again and found Annunciata had left no one knew
whither
It was a month later that Maria handed me a letter which had been given
to her for me by a dying person who had sent for her
 The letter was
from Annunciata who was no more
 It told me of her happiness at having
seen me once more--told me that she had always loved me; that her pain
at having to part from me had made her conceal her face on what she then
believed to be Bernardo's dead body; told me that it was she who had
sent me those two letters in Naples who had believed my love was dead
since I left for Rome without sending her a reply
 It told me of her
illness her years of poverty and her undying love
 And then she wished
me happiness with as she had been told the most beautiful and the
noblest maid in Venice for my bride! 
In travel I sought forgetfulness and consolation
 I went to Padua
Verona Milan; but heaviness did not leave my heart
 Then came an
irrepressible longing to be back in Venice to see Maria--a foreboding
of some new misfortune
 I hastened back to Venice
 The podestà received
me kindly; but when I inquired after Maria he seemed to me to become
grave as he told me she had gone to Padua on a short visit
 During
supper I fell into a swoon followed by a violent fever in which I had
visions of Maria dead laid out before an altar
 Then it was Lara I saw
on the bier and I loudly called her by name
 Then everything became
bright; a hand passed softly over my head
 I awoke and found Maria and
her aunt by my bedside
 You have heard my
voice at Pæstum
 You know it again! I feel it
 I love you; I have always
hand
I then learnt that Maria--my Lara--had been cured of her blindness by a
great specialist in Naples the podestà's brother who touched by her
beauty and purity had her educated and adopted her as his own child
On his death his sister took her to Venice where she found a new home
in the podestà's palace

APULEIUS
The Golden Ass
     Apuleius was born about 125 A
D
 at Madaura in Africa
     After studying at Athens he practised as an advocate at Rome
     and then wandered about Northern Africa lecturing on
     philosophy and rhetoric
 At Tripoli he was charged with having
     won by witchcraft the love of a rich widow who had left him
     her wealth
 But he was acquitted after delivering an
     interesting defence included among his extant works
 He then
     settled in Carthage where he died at an advanced age
 Poor
     Apuleius! His good fame was darkened by the success of an
     recreation at Rome
 He related the story of the adventures
     which befell a young Greek nobleman who by an extreme
     curiosity in regard to witchcraft got changed into a donkey
     It was an age of wild superstition and foolish credulity; and
     hero of it
 Apuleius was credited with a series of impossible
     exploits which he had not even invented
 For his work is
     merely a Latin adaptation of a lost Greek romance by Lucius of
     Patras
 But Apuleius deserves our gratitude for preserving a
     unique specimen of the lighter literature of the ancient
     Greeks together with the beautiful folk-tale of Cupid and
     Psyche
_I
--Lucius Sets Out on His Wonderful Adventures_
I set out from Corinth in a fever of excitement and expectation riding
my horse so hard that it fell lame; so I had to do the remainder of the
journey on foot
 My heart was filled with joy and terror as I entered
the town of Hypata
and witchcraft famous through the world for its marvels and
Carried away by my desire after strange and mystic knowledge I gazed
around with wonder and disquietude
 Nothing in this marvellous city I
thought to myself is really what it seems to be
 The stones I stumbled
over appeared to be living creatures petrified by magic
 I fancied that
the trees in the gardens and the birds that sang in their branches were
men that had been transformed by Thessalian witches
 The very statues
seemed as if they were about to walk; every wall had ears; and I looked
up into the blue cloudless sky expecting to hear oracles
Entering the market place I passed close to a noble lady who was
walking with a crowd of servants in her train
blushing and Byrrhena for it was she said to one of her companions:
Young tall and fair with just her bright grey-blue eyes and her
alert glance
 A Plutarch every bit of him! Lucius don't you remember
I remembered Byrrhena very well and loved her
 But I did not want to
meet her just then
 However I went with her to her house a beautiful
building of fine marble containing some exquisite statuary
I then told her that I had come to Hypata to see Milo and his wife
Pamphila
 My friend Demeas of Corinth had given me a letter of
introduction
her my child or she will practise her wicked arts on you
 It is just
handsome young men like you that she enchants and destroys
Far from being terrified by Byrrhena's warning I was delighted with it
I longed to become an apprentice to a witch as powerful as Pamphila
With a hasty excuse I left the house and set out to find Milo
 Neither
he nor Pamphila was in when I called
 But their maid who opened the
door was such a pretty wench that I did not regret their absence
Fotis as she was called was a graceful sprightly little thing with
the loveliest hair I ever saw
 I liked the way it fell in soft puffs on
her neck and rested on her neat linen tunic
It was a case of love at first sight with both of us
 But before I began
to ask her about Pamphila Milo returned
 He welcomed me very warmly
and put the best room in his house at my disposal and desired me to
stay to dinner
 But in spite of my ardent curiosity I was I must
confess rather afraid of meeting his wife
 So I said that my kinswoman
Byrrhena had already engaged me to dine with her
On arriving at Byrrhena's mansion I was surprised to find that a
splendid banquet had been prepared and that all the best people in
Hypata were present
 We reclined on couches of ivory covered with
golden drapery and a throng of lovely girls served us with exquisite
dishes; while pretty curly-headed boys brought the wine round in goblets
of gold and amber
When the lights were brought in the talk became freer and gayer;
everybody was bent on laughing and making his neighbours laugh
said to me
laughter
 You must come and invent some pleasantry to propitiate the
merriest of all deities
inspiration to-night I will do my best to entertain the townspeople
to-morrow
_II
--The Feast of the God of Laughter_
It was the jolliest banquet I was ever at
 Even in Corinth we did not do
the thing so well
 It was not until I got into the open air and set out
for Milo's house that I knew how much wine I had taken
 But though I
was rather unsteady on my feet I retained my presence of mind
 I
reached the house and suddenly three great burly fellows sprang up and
battered furiously at the door
 They were clearly robbers of the most
desperate type and I drew my sword and as they came at me one by one
I plunged it swiftly into their bodies
 Fotis was aroused and opened
the door and I entered utterly worn out by the struggle and went at
once to bed and to sleep
Early in the morning I was awakened by a great clamour
 A throng of
people burst into my bedroom and two lictors arrested me and dragged
me to the forum
 But as they took me through the streets and squares
everybody turned out to see me and the crowd grew so great that the
forum was not large enough to hold the people and I was led to the
theatre
There the lictors pushed me down through the proscenium as though I
were a victim for sacrifice and put me in the centre of the orchestra
late last night I saw this ferocious young foreigner sword in hand
slashing and stabbing three inoffensive creatures
 When I arrived they
were lying dead upon the ground
 Their murderer overwhelmed by his
terrible crime fled into a house and hid there hoping no doubt to
escape in the morning
 Men of Hypata you do not allow your own
fellow-townsmen to commit murder with impunity
 Shall then this
For some time I could not reply
 The suddenness of the whole thing
terrified me and it was with a voice broken with sobs that I at last
managed to make my defence
character! I caught them breaking into the house of my friend Milo your
esteemed fellowtownsman oh citizens of Hypata! There were three of
them--three great rough burly rascals each more than a match for a
mere boy like myself
 Yet I managed to kill them; and I think I deserve
praise at your hands and not censure for my public-spirited action
Here I stopped for I saw that all the vast multitude of people was
laughing at me
 And what grieved me most was to see my kinswoman
Byrrhena and my host Milo among my mockers
 The senior magistrate
ordered the wheel and other instruments of torture to be brought forth
we must torture him until he reveals the names of his partners in this
most dastardly crime
 But first of all let him look upon the bodies of
the men he has foully murdered
 Perhaps that will melt his hard savage
nature
The lictors then led me to the bier and forced me to uncover the
bodies
 Ye gods! The corpses were merely three inflated wine-skins and
I observed that they were cut in the very spots in which I thought I had
wounded the robbers
 I had indeed invented a pleasantry for the
festival of the god of laughter! The townspeople laughed with the
inextinguishable laughter of the Olympian deities
 They climbed up to
the roof to get a good look at me; they swarmed up the pillars; they
clung to the statues; they hung from the windows at the risk of their
lives; all shouting at me in wild jollity
your dignity and your rank
 The noble family to which you belong is
famous throughout Greece
 So do not take this pleasantry in honour of
the joyful god of laughter as an insult
 In return for your excellent
services at this great festival the city of Hypata has decreed that
your statue shall be cast in bronze and erected in a place of honour
By this time I had recovered somewhat of my good humour
 But knowing how
mercilessly I should be teased at the banquet Byrrhena wished to give in
celebration of my exploits I went quickly home with Milo and after
supping with him retired at a very early hour to my bed-chamber
_III
--Lucius Becomes an Ass_
In the middle of the night I heard a knock at my door
 I opened it and
in came pretty Fotis looking a picture of misery
cause of all the trouble that befell you to-day
 As my mistress was
coming from the baths yesterday she saw a handsome young gentleman
having his hair cut by a barber
 Seized with a wild passion for him she
ordered me to get some of his hair
 But the barber saw me and drove me
away
 I knew I should get a cruel whipping if I returned empty-handed
Close by was a man shaving some wine-bags of goat-skin; the hair was
soft and yellow like the young gentleman's so I took some of it to
Pamphila
 You know my mistress is a terrible witch so you can guess
what happened
 She rose up in the night and burnt the hair in her magic
cauldron
 As it burnt the wine-bags from which it was taken felt the
compulsion of the spell
 They became like human beings
 Rushing out into
the street they hurled themselves against the door of our house as
Pamphila expected the young gentleman would do
 You came up--just a
little intoxicated eh?--and committed the horrible crime of
bag-slaughter
this witchcraft
 What is Pamphila doing to-night? I have come here to
learn magic and I am very anxious to see her practising her strange
arts
We crept to the room where Pamphila was and peeped through a chink in
the door
 The witch undressed herself and then took some boxes of
ointment out of a casket and opened one box and smeared herself with
the stuff it contained
 In the twinkling of an eye feathers sprouted
out of her skin and she changed into an owl and flew out of the
window
to wait here all night until she returns and then give her a lotion of
aniseed and laurel-leaves to restore her to her proper shape
much about witchcraft as your mistress! Come practise on me! Get me
some of that ointment and change me into a bird
 Oh how I should like
After some hesitation she entered the room and took a box out of the
casket
 I stripped myself and smeared the ointment over my body
 But
never a feather appeared! Every hair on me changed into a bristle; my
hands turned into hoofed forefeet; a tail grew out of my backbone; my
face lengthened; and I found to my horror that I had become an ass
harm's done dear Lucius
 I know the antidote
 I'll get you some roses
to crunch and you will be restored to your proper shape
Fotis however dared not go at once into the garden lest Pamphila
should suddenly return and find me
 So she told me to go and wait in the
stable until daybreak and then she would gather some roses for me
 But
when I got into the stable I wished I had waited outside
 My own horse
and an ass belonging to Milo conceived a strange dislike to me
 They
fell upon me with great fury and bit me and kicked me and made such a
clamour that the groom came to see whatever was the matter
 He found me
standing on my hind legs trying to reach the garland of roses which he
had placed on the shrine of the goddess Epona in the middle of the
stable
As he was belabouring me with a great cudgel a band of fierce men armed
with swords and carrying lighted torches appeared
 At the sight of them
the groom fled in terror
But before the groom was able to fetch the watch the robbers forced
their way into the house and broke open Milo's strongbox
 Then they
loaded me and the horse and the ass with the stolen wealth and drove us
out into the mountains
 Unused to the heavy burden laid on me I went
rather slowly
 This enraged the robbers and they beat me until I was
well-nigh dead
 But at last I saw a sight which filled me with the
wildest joy
 We passed a noble country house surrounded by a garden of
sweet-smelling roses
 I rushed open-mouthed upon the flowers
 But just
as I strained my curling lips towards them I stopped
 If I changed
myself into a man the robbers would kill me either as a wizard or out
of fear that I would inform against them! So I left the roses untouched
and in the evening we came to the cave in the mountains where the
robbers dwelt and there to my delight I was relieved of my grievous
load
Soon afterwards another band of robbers arrived carrying a young and
lovely maid arrayed as a bride
 Her beautiful features were pale and
wet with tears and she tore her hair and her garments
comfort her
 Tell her she's in no danger
 Her people are rich and will
soon ransom her
Charite for such was the name of the beautiful bride fell weeping into
one of the old women's arms
enter my bridal chamber
 Our house was decked with laurel and the
bridal-song was being sung when a band of swordsmen entered with drawn
swords and carried me off
 Now I shall never see my bridegroom again
about it now
 After all you are not in so evil a plight as Psyche was
when she lost her husband Cupid
 Now listen while I tell you that
marvellous tale
And here is the tale of Cupid and Psyche as the old woman related it to
Charite:
_IV
--The Marvellous Story of Cupid and Psyche_
 All of
them were very beautiful but Psyche the youngest was lovelier even
than Venus
 The people worshipped her as she walked the streets and
strewed her path with flowers
 Strangers from all parts of the world
thronged to see her and to adore her
 The temples of Venus were
deserted and no garlands were laid at her shrines
 Thereupon the
goddess of love and beauty grew angry
 She tossed her head with a cry of
rage and called to her son Cupid and showed him Psyche walking the
streets of the city
 'Fill this maiden with burning love for the
ugliest wretchedest creature that lives on earth
'
bridal robes and set her upon a high mountain so that she might be
wedded to a horrible monster
 All the city was filled with grief and
lamentation when Psyche was led out to her doom and placed upon the
lonely peak
 Then a mighty wind arose and carried the maiden to an
enchanted palace where she was waited on by unseen spirits who played
sweet music for her delight and fed her with delicious food
 But in the
darkness of night someone came to her couch and wooed her tenderly and
she fell in love with him and became his wife
 And he said: 'Psyche you
may do what you will in the palace I have built for you
 But one thing
you must not do--you must not attempt to see my face
'
time; and in the daytime Psyche felt very lonesome
 So she begged her
husband to let her sisters come and stay with her and her husband had
them brought on a mighty wind
 When they saw how delightfully Psyche
lived in the enchanted palace they grew jealous of her strange
happiness
what the oracle said Psyche
 You are married to a monster! That is the
reason why he will not let you see his face
'
at her bedfellow
 Oh joy! It was Cupid the radiant young god of love
reposing in his beauty
 In her excitement Psyche let a drop of burning
oil fall from the lamp upon his right shoulder
 The god leaped up and
spread out his wings and flew away saying:
commands I wedded you myself
 And this is how you serve me! Farewell
Psyche! Farewell!'
she reached the court of Venus where Cupid was now imprisoned
 Venus
seized her and beat her and then set her on dangerous tasks and tried
to bring about her death
 But Psyche was so lovely and gentle that every
living creature wished to help her and save her
 Then Venus fearing
that Cupid would escape and rescue his wife said:
and ask her to fill it with beauty
'
 No mortal had ever returned from the Kingdom of
the Dead
 She climbed a high tower and prepared to throw herself down
and die
 But the very stones took pity upon her
Underworld
 Take two copper coins in your mouth and two honey-cakes in
your hands
'
leading to the Underworld
 A ghostly ferryman rowed her over the River
of Death and took one of her copper coins
 Then a monstrous dog with
three heads sprang out but Psyche fed him with one of her honey-cakes
and entered the hall of Proserpine the queen of the dead
 Proserpine
filled the casket and by means of the last honey-cake and the last
copper coin Psyche returned to the green bright earth
divine beauty it contained
 A deadly vapour came out and overpowered
her and she fell to the ground
 But Cupid who had now escaped from his
prison found her lying on the grass and wiped the vapour from her
face
 Taking her in his arms he spread out his wings and carried her
to Olympus; and there they live together in unending bliss with their
little child whose name is Joy
_V
--The Further Strange Adventures of the Ass_
While the old woman was entertaining the beautiful captive with this
charming tale a tall fierce young man in ragged clothes stalked boldly
in among the robbers
rags my boys
 They're a disguise
 Have you heard of Hæmus the famous
Thracian brigand? If so you've heard of me
 My band has been cut up
but I'm bringing what men I still have to you
The robbers had just lost their own captain so they received Hæmus with
great joy and made him their leader
 Soon afterwards ten of his men
came in loaded with swollen wine-bags
temperately
 Let us celebrate this glorious day by finishing it at one
The robbers at once fell furiously to drinking and their new captain
forced Charite to come and sit beside him
 After a little wooing she
began to cling to him and return his kisses
now here she is fondling a wretched assassin
What an ass I was! It was some time before I noticed that the new
captain did not drink himself and that the men he brought with him were
only pretending to drink while forcing the wine on the other robbers
who soon became too drunk to drink and rolled over in a deep sleep
who was none other than Tlepolemus the bridegroom of the fair Charite
And leaving his servants to perform this task he put Charite on my
back and led me to his native town
 All the inhabitants poured out into
the street to see us pass and they loudly acclaimed Tlepolemus for his
valour and ingenuity in rescuing his lovely bride and capturing the
robbers
Charite did not forget me in the scenes of rejoicing
 She patted my head
and kissed my rough face and bade the groom of the stud feed me well
and let me have the run of the fields
But alas! the groom was an avaricious disobedient slave and he at
once sold me to a troupe of those infamous beggarly priests of Cybele
who cart the Syrian goddess about the public squares to the sound of
cymbals and rattles
The next morning my new owners smeared their faces with rouge and
painted their eyes with black grease; then they dressed themselves in
white tunics and set their wretched goddess on my back and marched
out leaping and brandishing great swords and axes
 On coming to the
mansion of a wealthy man they raised a wild din and whirled about and
cut themselves and scourged themselves until they were covered with
blood
 The master of the mansion was so impressed with this savage and
degrading spectacle that he gave the priests a good sum of money and
invited them into his house
 They took the goddess with them and I
scampered out into the fields searching for some roses
But I was quickly brought back by the cook
 His master had given him a
fat haunch from an enormous stag to roast for the priests' dinner and a
dog had run off with it
 In order to avoid being whipped for his
carelessness the slave resolved to let the priests dine off a haunch of
their own ass
 He locked the door of the kitchen so that I could not
escape and then took a long knife and came to kill me
 But I had no
mind to perish in this way; and I dashed upstairs into the room where
the master was busy worshipping the goddess in the company of the
priests and knocked the table over and the goddess and many of the
worshippers
But the priests did not care to lose their salable property and they
locked me in their bedroom and sold me to the first man they met the
next morning
 It was a poor gardener who needed an ass to cart his stuff
to market
 But as the gardener was taking me home a soldier came
tramping along the road
 He too wanted an ass to carry his heavy kit
So he struck the gardener down with his sword and seized me by right of
conquest; then loading me with his armour and shield and baggage he
took me to the town to which he was travelling
 There he was ordered by
his tribune to take some letters to Rome so he disposed of me for a
small sum to two confectioners
By this time I had grown very feeble and thin
 Though I was changed into
an ass L could not relish hay and grass and food of that sort and I
derived scarcely any nourishment from it
 I still had human tastes as
well as human thoughts and feelings
 Happily I was very well off with
my new masters
 Every evening they brought home the remains of the
banquets they had served--bits of chicken pork fish and meat and
various cakes; and these they put in their room while they went for a
bath before dinner
 I used then to creep in and take all the best bits
and when my two masters returned they began to reproach each other with
having filched the choicest pieces
 In the meantime I grew plump and
glossy and broad-backed and as my masters observed I ate no hay they
spied on me one evening
They forgot their quarrel when they saw their ass picking out the best
bits with the taste of an epicure: and bursting open the door they
 They soon found that I was
intelligent and understood human language
 And after training me they
took me to Corinth and exhibited me there and made a great deal of
money
 Nobody
thought that any watch need be kept over an animal as thoroughly
civilised as I was; and one evening I succeeded in escaping and fled to
a lonely spot on the seashore
_VI
--The Miracle of Isis and the Fate of Lucius_
As I nestled down on the soft sand the full-orbed moon rose above the
eastern waves and shone with a glorious radiance
 My heart opened to
the mysteries of the sacred night and I sprang up and bathed seven
times in the cleansing water of the sea
 Then with tears upon my
cheeks I prayed to Isis the mighty saviour goddess:
as thou goest on thy lonely way hear me now and help me in my peril
and misery and misfortune! Restore me O mighty goddess to my rightful
shape and let Lucius return to the bosom of his family
Sleep fell swiftly upon my eyes and in my sleep the goddess visited me
She rose up a vision of light from the waters
 On her head was a crown
of radiant flowers shaped like the moon and serpents coiled about her
temples and her divine body was arrayed in a robe of shining darkness
embroidered with innumerable stars
 Cease now to weep and
mourn for I am come in pity of your lot to show favour to you
To-morrow my priest will descend to the seashore to celebrate my
festival and in his left hand he will carry a crown of roses
 Go forth
without fear and take the crown of roses and then put off the shape of
a beast and put on the form of a man
 Serve me well all the days of
your life and when you go down to the grave you shall see me as a light
amid the darkness--as a queen in the palace of hell
 By my favour you
shall be lifted up into the fields of Paradise and there you shall
worship and adore me for all eternity
The saviour goddess then vanished and I awoke and the dawn was in the
sky and the waves of the sea were dancing in the golden light
 A long
procession was winding down from the city to the shore to the sound of
flutes and pipes
First came a great multitude of people carrying lamps and torches and
tapers in honour of the constellations of heaven; then a choir of
sweet-voiced boys and girls in snowy garments; and next a train of men
and women luminous in robes of pure white linen; these were the
initiates; and they were followed by the prelates of the sacred
mysteries; and behind them all walked the high priest bearing in his
right hand the mystic rattle of Isis and in his left hand the crown of
roses
 By divine intervention the crowd parted and made a way for me;
and when I came to the priest he held out the roses and I ate them and
was changed into a man
 The people raised their hands to heaven
wonder-stricken by the miracle and the fame of it went out over all the
world
 The priest initiated me into the mysteries of Isis and Osiris
and I shaved my head and entered the College of Pastors and became a
servant of the high gods

The Arabian Nights
Or The Thousand and One Nights
     poems
 It is said that a certain Caliph Shahryar having been
     deceived by his wife slew her and afterwards married a wife
     only for one day slaying her on the morning after
 When this
     slaughter of women had continued some time he became wedded to
     one Shahrazad daughter of his Vizir who by telling the
     Commander of the Faithful exciting stories and leaving them
     unfinished every dawn so provoked the Caliph's curiosity that
     he kept her alive and at last grew so fond of her that he had
     no thought of putting her to death
 As for the authorship of
     the stories they are certainly not the work of one mind and
     have probably grown with the ages into their present form
 The
     editions published for Christian countries do not represent
     the true character of these legends which are often
     exceedingly sensual
 The European versions of this
     extraordinary entertainment began in 1704 with the work of one
     Antoine Galland Professor of Arabic at the College of France
     a Frenchman who according to Sir Richard Burton possessed
     captivating than culture or scholarship
 Burton (see
     Vol
 XIX) summed up what may be definitely believed of the
     Nights in the following conclusion: The framework of the book
     is purely Persian perfunctorily Arabised the archetype being
     the Hazar Afsanah
 The oldest tales may date from the reign of
     Al-Mansur in the eighth century; others belong to the tenth
     century; and the latest may be ascribed to the sixteenth
 The
     work assumed its present form in the thirteenth century

_I
--The Seven Voyages of Sindbad the Sailor_
When the father of Sindbad was taken to Almighty Allah much wealth came
to the possession of his son; but soon did it dwindle in boon
companionship for the city of Baghdad is sweet to the youthful
 Then
did Sindbad bethink him how he might restore his fortune saying to
better than the day of birth a live dog is better than a dead lion and
took ship and sailed away to foreign countries
Now it came to pass that the captain of this ship sighted a strange
island whereon were grass and trees very pleasant to the eyes
 So they
anchored and many went ashore
 When these had gathered fruits they
made a fire and were about to warm themselves when the captain cried
back to the ship and leave your gear and save yourselves from
destruction
 Allah preserve you! For this island whereon ye stand is no
true island but a great fish stationary a-middlemost of the sea
whereon the sand hath settled and trees have sprung up of old time so
that it is become like unto an island; but when ye lighted fires on it
it felt the heat and moved; and in a moment it will sink with you into
the depths of the sea and ye will be drowned
When the fish moved the captain did not wait for his passengers but
sailed away and Sindbad seizing a tub floated helpless in the great
waters
 But by the mercy of Allah he was thrown upon a true island
where a beautiful mare lay upon the ground who cried at his approach
Then a man started up at the mare's cry and seeing Sindbad bore him to
an underground chamber where he regaled the waif with plenteous food
To him did this man explain how he was a groom of King Mirjan and that
he brought the king's mares to pasture on the island hiding underground
while the stallions of the sea came up out of the waves unto the mares
Presently Sindbad saw this strange sight and witnessed how the groom
drove the stallions back to the waves when they would have dragged the
mares with them
 After that he was carried before King Mirjan who
entreated him kindly and when he had amassed wealth returned by ship
to Bussorah and so to Baghdad
But becoming possessed with the thought of travelling about the ways of
men he set out on a second voyage
 And it came to pass that he landed
with others on a lovely island and lay down to sleep after he had
eaten many delicious fruits
 Awaking he found the ship gone
 Then
praying to Almighty Allah like a man distracted he roamed about the
island presently climbing a tree to see what he could see
 And he saw a
great dome afar and journeyed to it
There was no entrance to this white dome and as he went round about it
the sun became suddenly darkened so that he looked towards it in fear
and lo! a bird in the heavens whose wings blackened all light
 Then did
Sindbad know that the dome was an egg and that the bird was the bird
roc which feeds its young upon elephants
 Sore afraid he hid himself
and the bird settled upon the egg and brooded upon it
 Then Sindbad
unwound his turban and tying one end to the leg of the great bird and
the other about his own middle waited for the dawn
When the dawn was come the bird flew into the heavens unaware of the
weight at its foot and Sindbad was borne across great seas and far
countries
 When at last the bird settled on land Sindbad unfastened his
turban and was free
But the place was filled with frightful serpents and strewn with
diamonds
 Sindbad saw a dead sheep on the ground with diamonds sticking
to its carcase and he knew that this was a device of merchants for
eagles come and carry away these carcases to places beyond the reach of
the serpents and merchants take the diamonds sticking to the flesh
 So
he hid himself under the carcase and an eagle bore him with it to
inhabited lands and he was delivered
Again it came to him to travel and on this his third voyage the ship
was driven to the mountain of Zughb inhabited by hairy apes
 These apes
seized all the goods and gear breaking the ship but spared the men
Then they perceived a great house and entered it but nobody was there
At nightfall however a frightful giant entered and began to feel the
men one by one till he found the fattest and him the giant roasted
over a fire and ate like a chicken
 This happened many days till
Sindbad encouraged his friends and they heated two iron spits in the
fire and while the giant slept put out his eyes
 While they ran to the
shore where they had built a raft the giant bellowing with rage
returned with two ghuls and pelted the raft with rocks killing some
but the rest escaped
 However three only were alive when they reached
land
The shore on which these three landed was occupied by an immense
serpent like a dragon who instantly ate one of the three while
Sindbad and the other climbed up a tree
 Next day the serpent glided up
the tree and ate the second
 Then Sindbad descended and with planks
bound himself all round so that he was a man surrounded by a fence
 Thus
did he abide safe from the serpent till a ship saved him
Now on his fourth voyage Sindbad's ship was wrecked and he fell among
hairy men cannibals who fattened all that they caught like cattle and
consumed them
 He being thin and wasted by all his misfortunes escaped
death and saw all his comrades fattened and roasted till they went
mad with cries of anguish
 It chanced that the shepherd who tended
these men in the folds took pity on Sindbad and showed him the road out
of danger which taking he arrived after divers adventures and
difficulties at the country of a great king
 In this country all were
horsemen but the saddle was unknown so Sindbad made first the king
and afterwards the vizir both saddle and stirrups which so delighted
them that he was advanced to great fortune and honour
Then was he married to a maiden most beautiful and chaste so lovely to
behold that she ravished the senses and he lived like one in a dream
But it came to pass that she died and when they buried her they took
Sindbad and shut him in the Place of the Dead with her giving him a
little food and water till he should die
 Such was the custom that
husband and wife should accompany the dead wife or husband in the Place
of the Dead--a mighty cave strewn with dead bodies dark as night and
littered with jewels
While Sindbad bewailed his lot in this place the doors opened a dead
body of a man was brought in and with it his live wife to whom food
was given
 Then Sindbad killed this fair lady with the bone of a leg
took her food and jewels and thus did he serve all the live people
thrust into the cavern
 One day he heard a strange sound far up the
cavern and perceived in the distance a wild beast
 Then he knew that
there must be some entrance at that far end and journeying thither
found a hole in the mountain which led to the sea
 On the shore Sindbad
piled all his jewels returning every day to the cavern to gather more
till a ship came and bore him away
His fifth voyage was interrupted by rocs whose egg the sailors had
smashed open to see the interior of what they took to be a dome
 These
birds flew over the ship with rocks in their claws and let them fall on
to the ship so that it was wrecked
Sindbad reached shore on a plank and wandering on this island perceived
an old man very sad seated by a river
 The old man signalled to
Sindbad that he should carry him on his back to a certain point and
this Sindbad very willingly bent himself to do
 But once upon his back
the legs over the shoulders and wound round about his flanks the old
man refused to get off and drove Sindbad hither and thither with most
cruel blows
 At last Sindbad took a gourd hollowed it out filled it
with grape juice stopped the mouth and set it in the sun
 Then did he
drink of this wine and get merry and forget his misery dancing with the
old man on his neck
 So the old man asked for the gourd and drank of
it and fell sleepy and dropped from Sindbad's neck and Sindbad slew
him
After that Sindbad amassed treasure by pelting apes with pebbles who
threw back at him cocoanuts which he sold for money
On his sixth voyage Sindbad was wrecked on the most frightful mountain
which no ship could pass
 The sight of all the useless wealth strewn
upon this terrible place of wreck and death drove all the other
passengers mad so that they died
 But Sindbad finding a stream built
a raft and drifted with it till almost dead he arrived among Indians
and Abyssinians
 Here he was well treated grew rich and returned in
prosperity to Baghdad
But once again did he travel and this time his vessel encountered in
the middle seas three vast fish-like islands which lashed out and
destroyed the ship eating most but Sindbad escaped
 When he reached
land he found himself well cared for among kind people and he grew rich
in an old man's house who married him to his only daughter
 One day
after the old man's death and when he was as rich as any in that land
lo! all the men grew into the likeness of birds and Sindbad begged one
of them to take him on his back on the mysterious flight to which they
were now bent
 After persuasion the man-bird agreed and Sindbad was
carried up into the firmament till he could hear the angels glorifying
God in the heavenly dome
 Carried away by ecstasy he shouted praise of
Allah into the holy place and instantly the bird fell to the ground
for they were evil and incapable of praising God
 But Sindbad returned
to his wife and she told him how evil were those people and that her
father was not of them and induced him to carry her to his own land
 So
he sold all his possessions took ship and came to Baghdad where he
lived in great splendour and honour and this was the seventh and last
voyage of Sindbad the Sailor
_II
--The Tale of the Three Apples_
The Caliph Haroun al-Raschid walking by night in the city found a
fisherman lamenting that he had caught nothing for his wife and
children
gold pieces for whatsoever cometh up
there came up a box wherein was found a young damsel foully murdered
Now to this murder confessed two men a youth and an old man; and this
was the story of the youth
His wife fell ill and had a longing for apples so that he made the
journey to Bussorah and bought three apples from the caliph's gardener
But his wife would not eat them
 One day as he sat in his shop passed
a slave bearing one of the apples
 The husband asked how he came by it
whereat replied the slave that his mistress gave it him saying that her
wittol of a husband had journeyed to Bussorah for it
 Then in rage the
young man returned and slew his wife
 Presently his little son came
home saying that he was afraid of his mother; and when the father
questioned him replied the child that he had taken one of his mother's
three apples to play with and that a slave had stolen it
 Then did the
husband know his wife to be innocent and he told her father all and
they both mourned for her and both offered themselves to the
executioner--the one that he was guilty the other to save his son-in-
law whose guilt was innocence
From this story followed that of Noureddin and his son Bedreddin Hassan
whose marriage to the Lady of Beauty was brought about by a genie in
spite of great difficulties
 And it was after hearing this tale that
be written in letters of liquid gold
_III
--Hassan the Rope-Maker_
Two men so it chanced disputing whether wealth could give happiness
came before the shop of a poor rope-maker
give this fellow two hundred pieces of gold and see what he does with
it
pieces and went forth to buy hemp for his trade and meat for his
children
As he journeyed a famished vulture made a pounce at the meat and
Hassan's turban fell off with which the vulture balked of the meat
flew away far out of sight
When the two men returned they found Hassan very unhappy and the same
who had given before gave him another two hundred pieces which Hassan
hid carefully all but ten pieces in a pot of bran
 While he was out
buying hemp his wife exchanged the pot of bran for some scouring sand
with a sandman in the street
 Hassan was maddened when he came home and
beat his wife and tore her hair and howled like an evil spirit
 When
his friends returned they were amazed by his tale but the one who had
as yet given nothing now gave Hassan a lump of lead picked up in the
nothing
Hassan thought but little of the lead and when a fisherman sent among
his neighbours that night for a piece of lead wherewith to mend his
nets very willingly did Hassan part with this gift the fisherman
promising him the first fish he should catch
When Hassan's wife cut open this fish to cook it she found within it a
large piece of glass crystal clear which she threw to the children for
a plaything
 A Jewess who entered the shop saw this piece of glass
picked it up and offered a few pieces of money for it
 Hassan's wife
dared not do anything now without her husband's leave and Hassan being
summoned refused all the offers of the Jewess perceiving that the
piece of glass was surely a precious diamond
 At last the Jewess offered
a hundred thousand pieces of gold and as this was wealth beyond
wealth Hassan very willingly agreed to the barter
_IV
--Prince Ahmed and the Fairy_
Once upon a time there was a sultan who had three sons and all these
young men loved their cousin the fatherless and motherless Nouronnihar
who lived at their father's court
To decide which should marry the princess the sultan bade them go forth
each a separate way and after a time determined to end their travels
by assembling at a certain place
princess my niece
The eldest of the princes Houssain by name consorted with merchants in
his travels but saw nothing strange or wonderful till he encountered a
man crying a piece of carpet for forty pieces of gold
it is instantly transported to whatsoever place he desires to visit be
it over wide seas or tall mountains
amused himself with it for some time and then flew joyfully to the
place of assembly
Hither came the second prince Ali who brought from Persia an ivory
tube down which if any man looked he beheld the sight that most he
desired to see; and the third prince the young Ahmed who had bought
for thirty-five pieces of gold a magic apple the smell of which would
restore a soul almost passed through the gate of death
The three princes desiring to see their beloved princess looked down
Ali's ivory tube and lo! the tragic sight that met their gaze--for the
princess lay at the point of death
Swiftly did they seat themselves upon Houssain's magic carpet and in a
moment of time found themselves beside the princess whom Ahmed
instantly restored to life and beauty and health by his magic apple
As it seemed impossible to decide which of these rare things was the
rarest the sultan commanded that each prince should shoot an arrow and
he whose arrow flew farthest should become the husband of Nouronnihar
Houssain drew the first bow; then Ali whose arrow sped much farther
and then Ahmed whose arrow was not to be found
Houssain in despair gave up his right of succession to the throne
and with a blighted heart went out into the wilderness to become a
holy man
 Ali was married to the princess and Ahmed went forth into the
world to seek his lost arrow
After long wandering Ahmed found his arrow among desolate rocks too
far for any man to have shot with the bow; and while he looked about
him amazed and dumfounded he beheld an iron door in the rocks which
yielded to his touch and led into a very sumptuous palace
 There
advanced towards him a lady of surpassing loveliness who announced that
she was a genie that she knew well who he was and had sent the carpet
the tube and the apple and had guided his arrow to her door
Furthermore she confessed to the prince great love for him and offered
him all that she possessed leading him to a vast and magnificent
chamber where a marriage-feast was prepared for them
Prince Ahmed was happy for some while and then he thought of his
father grieving for him and at last obtained leave from the beautiful
genie to go on a visit to his home
 At first his father was glad to see
him but afterwards jealousy of his son and the son's secret place of
dwelling and suspicion that a son so rich and powerful might have
designs on his throne led his father to lay hard and cruel burdens on
Prince Ahmed
However all that he commanded Ahmed performed by help of the genie
even things the most impossible
 He brought a tent which would cover the
sultan's army and yet folded up lay in the hollow of a man's hand
This and many other wonderful things did Ahmed perform till the sultan
asked for a man one foot and a half in height with a beard thirty feet
long who could carry a bar of iron weighing five hundredweight
Such a man the genie found and the sultan beholding him turned away
in disgust; whereat the dwarf flew at him in a rage and with his iron
bar smote him to death
Thus too did the little man treat all the wicked courtiers and
sorcerers who had incensed the sultan against his son
 And Ahmed and the
genie became sultan and sultana of all that world while Ali and
Nouronnihar reigned over a great province bestowed upon them by Prince
Ahmed
As for Houssain he forsook not the life of a holy man living in the
wilderness
_V
--The Hunchback_
There lived long ago a poor tailor with a pretty wife to whom he was
tenderly attached
 One day there came to his door a hunchback who
played upon a musical instrument and sang to it so amusingly that the
tailor straightway carried him to his wife
 So delighted by the
hunchback's singing was the tailor's wife that she cooked a dish of fish
and the three sat down to be merry
 But in the midst of the feast a bone
stuck in the hunchback's throat and before a man could stare he was
dead
 Afraid that they should be accused of murder the tailor conspired
with his wife what they should do
piece of money he sallied forth at dark with the hunchback's body and
arrived before the house of a doctor
Here knocked he on the door and giving the maid a piece of money bade
her hasten the doctor to his need
 So soon as the maid's back was
turned he placed the hunchback on the top stair and fled
 Now the
doctor coming quickly struck against the corpse so that it fell to the
bottom of the stairs
and fearing to be accused of murder carried the body in to his wife
Now they had a neighbour who was absent from home and going to his room
they placed the corpse against the fireplace
 This man returning and
belabour the hunchback till the body rolled over and lay still
 Then in
great fear of his deed this Mussulman carried the corpse into the
street and placed it upright against a shop
Came by a Christian merchant at dawn of day and running against the
hunchback tumbled him over; then thinking himself attacked he struck the
body and at that moment the watch came by and haled the merchant before
the sultan
Now the hunchback was a favourite of the sultan and he ordered the
Christian merchant to be executed
To the scaffold just when death was to be done came the Mussulman and
confessed that he was the murderer
 So the executioner released the
Christian and was about to hang the other when the doctor came and
confessed to being the murderer
 So the doctor took the place of the
Mussulman when the tailor and his wife hastened to the scene and
confessed that they were guilty
commanded this story of the hunchback to be written in a book
_VI
--Aladdin or the Wonderful Lamp_
There was in the old time a bad and idle boy who lived with his mother
a poor widow and gave her much unrest
 And there came to him one day a
wicked magician who called himself the boy's uncle and made rich
presents to the mother and one day he led Aladdin out to make him a
merchant
 Now the magician knew by his magic of a vast hoard of wealth
together with a wonderful lamp which lay in the earth buried in
Aladdin's name
 And he sent the boy to fetch the lamp giving him a
magic ring and waited on the earth for his return
 But Aladdin his
pockets full of jewels refused to give up the lamp till his false uncle
helped him to the surface of the earth and in rage the magician caused
the stone to fall upon the cave and left Aladdin to die
But as he wept wringing his hands the genie of the magic ring
appeared and by his aid Aladdin was restored to his mother
 There with
the genie of the lamp to wait upon him he lived till seeing the
sultan's daughter pass on her way to the bath he conceived violent love
for her and sent his mother to the sultan with all his wonderful
jewels asking the princess in marriage
 The sultan astonished by the
gift of jewels set Aladdin to perform prodigies of wonder but all
these he accomplished by aid of the genie so that at last the sultan
was obliged to give him the princess in marriage
 And Aladdin caused a
great pavilion to rise near the sultan's palace and this was one of the
wonders of the world and there he abode in honour and fame
Then the wicked magician knowing by magic the glory of Aladdin came
pavilion gave him the wonderful lamp and received a new one from the
coppersmith
 The magician transplanted the pavilion to Africa and
Aladdin coming home found the sultan enraged against him and his
palace vanished
 But by means of the genie of the ring he discovered the
whereabouts of his pavilion and going thither slew the magician
possessed himself anew of the lamp and restored his pavilion to its
former site
But the magician's wicked brother plotting revenge obtained access to
the princess in disguise of a holy woman he had foully murdered and he
would have certainly slain Aladdin but for a warning of the genie by
which Aladdin was enabled to kill the magician
 After that Aladdin lived
in glory and peace and ascended in due course to the throne and
reigned with honour and mercy
_VII
--Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves_
Now the father of Ali Baba left both his sons poor; but Kasim married a
rich wife and so he lived plenteously while his poor brother Ali
Baba worked in the wood
 It came to pass that Ali Baba one day saw in
When they were gone out again Ali Baba came from his hiding and
addressing the rock in the same way found that it obeyed him
 Then went
he in and took much of the treasure which he drove home on his mule
Now when his wife sent to the brother Kasim for scales wherewith she
might weigh all this treasure the sister-in-law being suspicious that
one so poor should have need of scales smeared the bottom of the pan
with wax and grease and discovered on the return a gold piece
 This she
showed to Kasim who made Ali Baba confess the tale
 Then Kasim went to
the cave entered loaded much treasure and was about to depart when
he found he had forgotten the magic words whereby he entered
 There was
he found by the forty thieves who slew and quartered him
 Ali Baba
found the quarters took them home got a blind tailor to sew them
together and gave his brother burial
Now the robbers discovered Ali Baba's house and they hid themselves in
oil-jars hung on the backs of mules and the captain drove them
 Thus
came they to Ali Baba's house and the captain craved lodging for
himself and his beasts
 Surely would Ali Baba have been captured
tortured and put to death but for his maid the faithful and astute
Morgiana who discovered men in the jars and boiling cans of oil
poured it upon them one by one and so delivered her master
 But the
captain had escaped and Ali Baba still went in great fear of his life
But when he returned disguised so that he might have puzzled the
wisest Morgiana recognised the enemy of her master; and she was dancing
before him and filling his eyes with pleasure; and when it came for her
to take the tambourine and go round for largess she strengthened her
heart and quick as the blinding lightning plunged a dagger into his
vitals
 Thus did the faithful Morgiana save her master and he married
her to his nephew the son of Kasim and they lived long in great joy
and blessing
_VIII
--The Fisherman and the Genie_
There was once a poor fisherman who every day cast his net four times
into the sea
 On a day he went forth and casting in his net drew up
with great labour a dead jackass; casting again an earthen pitcher full
of sand; casting a third time vexatiously potsherds and shattered
glass; and at the last a jar of yellow copper leaden-capped and
stamped with the seal-ring of Solomon the son of David
 His rage was
silenced at sight of the sacred seal and removing the cap smoke
issued which taking vast shape became a terrible genie frightful to
see
how Solomon had placed him in the jar for heresy and how he had lain
all those years at the bottom of the sea
 For a hundred years he said
he swore that he would make rich for ever and ever the man who freed
him; for the next hundred that for such an one he would open the hoards
of the earth; then that he would perfectly fulfil such an one's three
wishes; finally in his rage that he would kill the man who freed him
Now the fisherman having pleaded in vain said that he did not believe
the tale seeing that so huge a genie could never have got into so small
a jar
 Whereat the genie made smoke of himself and re-entered the vase
Instantly then did the fisherman stopper it nor would he let the genie
free till that wicked one had promised to spare his life and do him
service
 Grudgingly and wrathfully did the genie issue forth but being
now under oath to Allah he spared the fisherman and did him service
He took him to a lake in the black mountains bade him throw in his net
and bear the catch to the sultan
 Now by the fisherman's catching of
four fish all of a different hue the sultan discovered that this lake
in the mountains was once a populous and mighty city whereof the prince
and all the inhabitants had been bewitched in ancient time
 When the
city was restored and all those many people called back to life the
sultan enriched the fisherman who lived afterwards in wealth
_IX
--The Enchanted Horse_
In olden times there came to the Court of Persia a stranger from Ind
riding a horse made of wood which said he could fly whithersoever its
rider wished
 When the sultan had seen the horse fly to a mountain and
hand
 Howsoever
lest another king become possessed of the horse I will bargain for it
But the impetuous prince doubting the truth of the horse's power
jumped upon its back turned the peg which he had observed the Hindu to
turn and instantly was borne far away
The king enraged that the Hindu could not bring back his son had the
man cast into prison albeit the Hindu protested that soon the prince
must discover the secret of stopping the horse by means of a second peg
and therefore would soon return
Now the prince did not discover this secret till he was far away and it
was night
 He came to earth near a palace and going in found there an
exquisite lady sleeping and knew by her dress that she was of a rank
equal with his own
 Then he pleaded to her for succour and she
constrained him to stay and for many weeks he abode as a guest
 After
And early one dawn he bore her to Persia on the back of the enchanted
horse
So glad was the king at his son's return that he released the Hindu
Now the Hindu hearing what had happened determined on revenge
 He
found where the horse was placed and going to the palace where the
foreign princess was housed sent for her in the sultan's name and she
came to him
 Then he seated her upon the horse and mounting up in full
view of the sultan and his royal son flew far away with his lovely
captive
It was the Hindu's desire to marry this princess but when they were
come to earth she withstood him and cried for help and succour
 To her
came the sultan of that place and slew the Hindu and would have
married her but she was faithful to her lover and feigned madness
Then the sultan offered rewards to any who should cure her of this
frightful madness and many physicians came and failed
 Now her lover
distracted at sight of seeing her in mid-air with the Hindu had turned
Holy Man roaming the earth without hope like one who is doomed
It happened that he came to the palace where the princess lay in her
feigned madness and hearing the tale of her and of the enchanted
horse with new hope and a great joy in his heart he went in disguised
as a physician and in secret made himself known
enchanted horse hath she contracted this madness and by the enchanted
horse shall she lose it
array to crown her with jewels and gold and to lead her forth to the
palace square
A vast concourse assembled there and the prince set his beloved lady on
the horse and pretending incantations leapt suddenly upon its back
turned the peg and as the enchanted steed flew towards Persia over his
a princess who implores thy protection ask first for her consent

AUCASSIN AND NICOLETTE
Song-Story of the Twelfth Century
     Belgium may claim to have produced the finest poet of the ages
     of chivalry
 He was probably a contemporary of the English
     minstrel king Richard the Lion-hearted
 But nothing is known
     of him save what can be gathered from the exquisite story of
     love which he composed in his old age
 Perhaps he too was
     in his younger days a Crusader as well as a minstrel and
     fought in the Holy Land against the Saracens
     is certainly Arabian both in form and substance
 Even his
     hero Aucassin the young Christian lord of Beaucaire bears
     an Arabian name--Alcazin
 There is nothing in Mohammedan
     sorrowful tender-hearted minstrel knight who wandered from
     castle to castle in Hainault and Picardy seven hundred years
     ago is one of the master-singers of the world
_I
--Lovers Young and Fair_
    Listen to a tale of love
    Which an old grey captive wove
    Great delight and solace he
    Found in his captivity
    As he told what toils beset
    Aucassin and Nicolette;
    And the dolour undergone
    And the deeds of prowess done
    By a lad of noble race
    For a lady fair of face
    Though a man be old and blind
    Sick in body and in mind
    If he hearken he shall be
    Filled with joy and jollity
    So delectable and sweet
    Is the tale I now repeat
Now a war broke out between Count Bougars of Valence and Count Garin of
Beaucaire; and Count Bougars besieged Beaucaire with a hundred knights
and ten thousand men
 Then Count Garin who was old and feeble said to
his fair young son Aucassin:
sweet love Nicolette to wife
land than see you wedded to her
 What! A Saracen girl bought by one of
my captains! A slave! A heathen! A witch! God! I will burn her in a
fire and you with her
 I will fight Count
Bougars if you will let me speak to Nicolette after the battle
 And he said this because Count Bougars was
well night master of Beaucaire
Aucassin went out to battle in great joy
 But his father went in great
anger to the captain that had bought Nicolette from the Saracens and
said:
also unless you have a care
And the captain who had adopted Nicolette as his daughter was afraid
both for himself and for his godchild
 And he hid her in the tower that
stood in the garden of his house
    In the tower that Nicolette
    Prisoned is may no man get
    Pleasant is her room to see
    Carved and painted wondrously
    But no pleasure can she find
    In the paintings to her mind
    Look! For she is standing there
    By the window with her hair
    Yellow like autumnal wheat
    When the sunshine falls on it
    Blue-grey eyes she has and brows
    Whiter than the winter snows;
    And her face is like a flower
    As she gazes from the tower:
    As she gazes far below
    Where the garden roses blow
    And the thrush and blackbird sing
    In the pleasant time of spring
    In a prison cell must lie;
    Parted by a cruel spite
    From my young and lovely knight
    By the eyes of God I swear
    Prisonment I will not bear!
    Here for long I shall not stay:
    Love will quickly find a way
In the meantime Aucassin mounted a great war-horse and rode out to
battle
 Still dreaming of Nicolette he let the reins fall and his
horse carried him among his foes
 They took him prisoner and sent word
to Count Bougars to come and see them hang the heir of Beaucaire
Striking out in a great passion he made a havoc about him like a boar
that turns at bay on the hounds in a forest
 Ten knights he struck down
and seven he wounded
 Then spying Count Bougars that had come to see
him hanged he lashed at his helm and stunned him and took him
prisoner to Beaucaire
 The war is ended
 Now let me
see Nicolette
 So
help me God
 I will have a
pledge from you; give me your hand
father all the hurt and damage and shame you can; for he is a liar
Thereupon Count Bougars pledged him and Aucassin set him free
 Then
Aucassin went to the captain that was godfather to Nicolette
would go to hell
priests and cripples that grovel and pray at altars and tattered
beggars that die of cold and hunger
 These only go to heaven and I do
not want their company
 So I will go to hell
 For there go all good
scholars and the brave knights that died in wars and sweet ladies that
had many lovers and harpers and minstrels and great kings
 Give me
but my Nicolette and gladly I will keep them company
_II
--Love's Song in a Dungeon_
Aucassin returned very sorrowfully to the castle and there his father
put him into a dungeon
    Aucassin is cast and bound
    In a dungeon underground;
    Never does the sunlight fall
    Shining on his prison wall;
    Only one faint ray of it
    Glimmers down a narrow slit
    But does Aucassin forget
    His sweet lady Nicolette?
    Listen! He is singing there
    And his song is all of her:
    In this dungeon where I lie
    Wonder of the world I will
    Worship thee and praise thee still!
    By the beauty of thy face
    By the joy of thy embrace
    By the rapture of thy kiss
    And thy body's sweetnesses
    Miracle of loveliness
    Comfort me in my distress!
    Surely 'twas but yesterday
    That the pilgrim came this way--
    Weak and poor and travel-worn--
    Who in Limousin was born
    With the falling sickness he
    Stricken was full grievously
    He had prayed to many a saint
    For the cure of his complaint;
    But no healing did he get
    Till he saw my Nicolette
    Even as he lay down to die
    Nicolette came walking by
    On her shining limbs he gazed
    As her kirtle she upraised
    And he rose from off the ground
    Healed and joyful whole and sound
    Miracle of loveliness
As Aucassin was singing in his dungeon Nicolette was devising how to
get out of her tower
 It was now summer time in the month of May when
the day is warm long and clear and the night still and serene
Nicolette lay on her bed and the moonlight streamed through the window
and the nightingale sang in the garden below; and she thought of
Aucassin her lover whom she loved and of Count Garin who hated her
and kill me
The old woman that was set to watch over her was asleep
 Nicolette put
on her fine silken kirtle and took the bedclothes and knotted them
together and made a rope
 This she fastened to the bar of her window
and so got down from the tower
 Then she lifted up her kirtle with both
hands because the dew was lying deep on the grass and went away down
the garden
Her locks were yellow and curled; her eyes blue-grey and laughing; her
lips were redder than the cherry or rose in summertime; her teeth white
and small; so slim was her waist that you could have clipped her in your
two hands; and so firm were her breasts that they rose against her
bodice as if they were two apples
 The daisies that bent above her
instep and broke beneath her light tread looked black against her
feet; so white the maiden was
She came to the postern gate and unbarred it and went out through the
streets of Beaucaire keeping always in the shadows for the moon was
shining
 And so she got to the dungeon where her lover Aucassin lay
She thrust her head through the chink and there she heard Aucassin
grieving for her whom he loved so much
 Your father
hates me to death and I must cross the sea and go to some strange
land
 The first
man that saw you would take you to his bed
 And then do you think I
would wait till I found a knife? No! I would dash my head to pieces
against a wall or a rock
loves woman
 Woman only loves with her eyes; man loves with his heart
Aucassin and Nicolette were thus debating when the soldiers of the
count came marching down the street
 Their swords were drawn and they
were seeking for Nicolette to slay her
the dungeon
a great loss to Beaucaire
And with that he struck up a merry tune but the words he sang to it
were not merry
    Lady with the yellow hair
    Lovely sweet and debonair
      Now take heed
    Death comes on thee unaware
    Turn thee now; oh turn and flee;
    Death is coming suddenly
          And the swords
    Flash that seek to murder thee
Wrapping herself in her mantle she hid in the shadows until the
soldiers went by
 Then she said farewell to Aucassin and climbed up the
castle-wall where it had been broken in the siege
 But steep and deep
was the moat and Nicolette's fair hands and feet were bleeding when she
got out
 But she did not feel any pain because of the great fear that
was on her lest she should fall into the hands of the count's men
Within two bow-shots from Beaucaire was a great forest; and here
Nicolette slept in a thicket until the herd-boys came in the morning
and pastured their cattle close to her resting-place
 They sat down by a
fountain and spread out a cloak and put their bread on it
 Their
shouting aroused Nicolette and she came to them
others
this forest that he must come and hunt
 If he can take it he will not
sell a limb of it for a hundred marks of gold
 Nay not for any money
others
wolf or lion--with a limb worth more than two or three pence
 You speak
of some enchantment and you are a fairy woman
 We do not want your
company
 Go away
 For the beast
has a medicine that will cure Aucassin of all his pain
 Ah! I have five
pieces of money in my purse
 Take them and tell him
 He must come and
hunt within three days and if he does not he will never be cured
_III
--Aucassin Goes in Quest of Nicolette_
Nicolette took leave of the herd-boys and went into the forest down a
green way that led to a place where seven paths met
 Close at hand was a
deep thicket and there Nicolette built a lodge of green boughs and
covered it with oak-leaves and lily-flowers and made it sweet and
pleasant both inside and out
 And she stayed in this lodge to see what
Aucassin would do
In the meantime the cry went through all the country that Nicolette was
lost
 Some said that she had gone away; others that Count Garin had put
her to death
 If any man had joy in the news that man was not Aucassin
His father let him out of prison and summoned all the knights and
ladies of the land to a great feast that he made to comfort his young
son
 But when the revelry was at its height there was Aucassin leaning
despondently from a gallery sorrowful and utterly downcast
 And an old
knight saw him and came to him
sickness that you have
 If you will trust me I will give you some good
counsel
thing
will see the flowers and the sweet herbs and hear the birds singing
And perchance you may also hear a word that will take away your
sickness
He stole out of the hall and went to the stable and bridled and
saddled his horse and rode swiftly out into the forest
 By the fountain
he found the herd-boys
 They had spread a cloak out on the grass and
were eating their bread and making merry
    Jolly herd-boys every one:
    Martin Emery and John
    Aubrey Oliver and Matt
    By the fountain-side they sat
    Son of our good Count Garin
    Faith he is a handsome boy!
    Let us wish him luck and joy
    Aubrey said
    Gold than we have seen before
    Knives and swords! Then we can go
    Out to war and fight the foe
that you were singing just now I pray you
 But we are not
your men but the count's
want to? There is no man in this country--save Count Garin--that dare
drive my cattle from his fields and corn-lands if I put them there
 He
would lose his eyes for it no matter how rich he were
 So now why
anything
 Still if you like I will tell you something
between prime and tierce and a maid came by--the loveliest thing in all
the world
 She lighted up the forest with her beauty; so we thought she
was a fairy woman
 But she gave us some money; and we promised that if
you came by we would tell you to go hunting in the forest
 In there is a
beast of marvellous value
 If you took it you would not sell one of its
limbs for many marks of gold for it has a medicine that will cure your
sickness
 Now I have told you all
And as he spurred his horse into the forest Aucassin sang right
joyously:
    Track of boar and slot of deer
    Neither do I follow here
    Nicolette I hotly chase
    Down the winding woodland ways--
    Thy white body thy blue eyes
    Thy sweet smiles and low replies
    God in heaven give me grace
    Once to meet thee face to face;
    Once to meet as we have met
    Nicolette--oh Nicolette!
_IV
--Love in the Forest_
Furiously did his horse bear him on through the thorns and briars that
tore his clothes and scratched his body so that you could have followed
the track of his blood on the grass
 But neither hurt nor pain did he
feel for he thought only of Nicolette
 All day he sought for her in the
forest and when evening drew on he began to weep because he had not
found her
 Night fell but still he rode on; and he came at last to the
place where the seven roads met and there he saw the lodge of green
boughs and lily-flowers which Nicolette had made
this lodge with her own fair hands! For the sweetness of it and for
love of her I will sleep here to-night
As he sat in the lodge Aucassin saw the evening star shining through a
gap in the boughs and he sang:
    Star of eve! Oh star of love
    Gleaming in the sky above!
    Nicolette the bright of brow
    Dwells with thee in heaven now
    God has set her in the skies
    To delight my longing eyes;
    And her clear and yellow hair
    Shines upon the darkness there
    Oh! my lady would that I
    Swiftly up to thee could fly
    Meet thee greet thee kiss thee fold thee
    To my aching heart and hold thee
    Here without thee nothing worth
    Can I find upon the earth
When Nicolette heard Aucassin singing she came into the bower and
threw her arms around his neck and kissed him
 Aucassin then set his
sweet love upon his horse and mounted behind her; and with all haste
they rode out from the forest and came to the seashore
There Aucassin saw a ship sailing upon the sea and he beckoned to it;
and the sailors took him and Nicolette on board and they sailed to the
land of Torelore
 And the King of Torelore welcomed them courteously;
and for two whole years they lived in great delight in his beautiful
castle by the sea
 But one night the castle was suddenly stormed by the
Saracens; and Aucassin was bound hand and foot and thrown into a ship
and Nicolette into another
The ship that carried Aucassin was wrecked in a great storm and it
drifted over the sea to Beaucaire
 The people that ran to break up the
wreck found their young lord and made great joy over his return
 For
his father was dead and he was now Count Aucassin
 The people led him
to the castle and did homage to him and he held all his lands in
peace
 But little delight had Aucassin in his wealth and power and
kingdom
    Though he lived in joy and ease
    And his kingdom was at peace
    Aucassin did so regret
    His sweet lady Nicolette
    That he would have liefer died
    In the battle by her side
    All my kingdom I would give
    For the news that still you live
    For the joy of finding you
    Would I search the whole world through
    Did I think you living yet
_V
--Nicolette's Love Song_
In the meantime the Saracens took Nicolette to their great city of
Carthage; and because she was lovely and seemed of noble birth they led
her to their king
 And when Nicolette saw the King of Carthage she knew
him again; and he also knew her
 For she was his daughter who had been
carried off in her young days by the Christians
 Her father held a great
feast in honour of Nicolette and would have married her to a mighty
king of Paynim
 But Nicolette had no mind to marry anyone but Aucassin
and she devised how she might get news of her lover
 One night she
smeared her face with a brown ointment and dressed herself in
minstrel's clothes and took a viol and stole out of her father's
palace to the seashore
 There she found a ship that was bound for
Provence and she sailed in it to Beaucaire
 She took her viol and went
playing through the town and came to the castle
 Aucassin was sitting
on the castle steps with his proud barons and brave knights around him
gazing sorrowfully at the sweet flowers and listening to the singing of
the birds
sad
She drew the bow across her viol and made sweet music and then she
sung:
    Once a lover met a maid
    Wandering in a forest glade
    Where she had a pretty house
    Framed with flowers and leafy boughs
    Maid and lover merrily
    Sailed away across the sea
    To a castle by the strand
    Of a strange and pleasant land
    There they lived in great delight
    Till the Saracens by night
    Stormed the keep and took the maid
    With the captives of their raid
    Back to Carthage they returned
    And the maiden sadly mourned
    But they did not make of her
    Paramour or prisoner
    For the King of Carthage said
    When he saw the fair young maid:
    For she had been stolen when
    She was young by Christian men
    And the captain of Beaucaire
    Bought her as a slave-girl there
    Once her lover loved her well
    Now alas! he cannot tell
    Who she is
 Does he forget--
    Aucassin--his Nicolette?
Aucassin leaped down the castle steps and took his lady in his arms
Then she went to the house of her godfather the captain of the town
and washed all the brownness from her face and clad herself in robes of
rich silk
 And early on the morrow Count Aucassin wedded her and made
her Lady of Beaucaire; and they had great joy of one another
 And here
my song-story ends
 I know no more

_I
--A Peasant Nurse in a Royal Palace_
Walpurga was as in a dream
 It had all happened so quickly! Only a
fortnight ago on the walk home from Sunday Mass at the village church
her Hanseï had to make a hay bed for her on a stone-heap by the
roadside
 She had thought she could not get back to the cottage in time
but she recovered after a while and bravely walked home
 Her mother was
with her in the hour of suffering as she had been with her through all
the joys and sorrows of her simple life
 Then came the supreme joy of
the awakening with a new life by her side a baby-girl groping
helplessly for the mother's breast
 Then--was it only yesterday?--when
she was waiting for the return of the christening party a carriage
drove up with the village doctor and an elegant stranger
 There was much
beating about the bush and then it came out like a thunderbolt
 The
stranger was a great doctor from the capital entrusted with the mission
to find in the mountains an honest comely peasant woman and married
she must be to act as wet-nurse for the expected crown prince or
princess
Then Hanseï came home with the merry party--there was much storming and
angry refusal; but finally the practical sense of the peasant folk
prevailed
 It was after all only for a year and it would mean comfort
and wealth instead of hunger and grinding poverty
 And scarcely had
their consent been wrung from them when shouting and cheering announced
the great event of the crown prince's birth
 Then came that strange
long drive over hill and dale through the dark night; and now in the
Royal Palace she tried to collect herself to grasp the meaning of all
that splendour the unintelligible ceremonious talk and bearing of those
about her
 She was to be taken at once to see the queen and her precious
charge
Walpurga was full of happiness when she left the queen's bedroom
Touched by the comely young peasant-woman's naive and familiar
kindliness the queen who seemed to her beautiful as an angel had
without much trouble and she soon became accustomed to her new life
although her thoughts often dwelt longingly on her native mountains her
own child and mother and husband
 How they would miss her! She knew her
Hanseï was a good man at heart but not particularly shrewd and easily
gulled or led astray
Meanwhile her high spirits her artless bluntness the quaint
superstitions of the mountain child gained her the goodwill and
approval of the king and queen of Dr
 Gunther the court physician of
the whole royal household and above all of the lady-in-waiting
Countess Irma Wildenort
_II
--The Love Affairs of a King_
Countess Irma's letters to Emmy her only convent friend contained
little of idle gossip and of things that had happened
 They had no
continuity
 They were introspective and took the form of a diary taken
up at odd moments and left again to be continued sometimes the
following day sometimes after a week
 They revealed intellectual
development far in advance of her years and clear perception of
character
raise everybody to her exalted mood--liana-like in the morning-glow and
evening-glow of sentiment never in white daylight
 She is most gracious
towards me but we feel it instinctively--there is something in her and
in me that does not harmonise
to think for myself
 The queen is too
serious--eternal organ sound; but you cannot dance to an organ and we
are young and love to dance
 I was
with her at the king's request
 I stood by the cot when the king
arrived
 He said to me gently: 'It is true an angel stands by the
child's cradle
' He laid his hand upon mine which rested on the rail of
the cot
 The king went
 And just imagine what occurred
 The nurse a
fresh merry person with blue eyes buxom and massive a perfect peasant
beauty to whom I showed friendliness so as to cheer her up and save
her from feeling homesick the nurse tells me in bald words: 'You are an
adulteress! You have exchanged loving glances with the king!'
that they are as corrupt as the great world and moreover without the
curb of culture
 She begged my pardon for her
impertinence; I remain friendly towards her
 Yes I will
Irma's devotion to her king had something of hero-worship
 And the king
who loved his wife sincerely but was and wanted to be of a heroic
nature and who was averse to all that savoured of self-torment and
sentimentality was attracted by Countess Irma's intellectual freedom
and _esprit_
 He felt in her a kindred spirit
 Her company was
stimulating; it could not affect the even tenour of his conjugal love
But the queen in her sentimental exultation sought ever for new
 And now she
wanted to give the supreme proof by renouncing her Lutheran faith to
enter into a yet closer union with her Catholic husband
 To the king
this sacrifice seemed not only sentimentally weak but politically
unwise
 He received the confidence coldly and begged her to reconsider
the matter
 He sent Dr
 Gunther who in spite of his democratic
tendencies was held in high esteem by the king and had great influence
over the queen to exercise his persuasive powers--with no result
Where wisdom and experience had failed the voice of Nature speaking
out of Walpurga's childish chatter succeeded
 Walpurga told the queen
of her father--how one day on the lake on hearing the choral singing of
in Heaven! All the Churches ours and the Lutheran and the Jewish and
the Turkish they are all voices in the song
 Each sings as he knows
and yet it sounds well together up there
day when she informed her spouse that she had the courage of her own
inconsistency and that she had resolved to do his will
 The sacrifice
was received with coolness
 Was it that her noble act was construed as
further evidence of weakness?
The king had left town for some distant watering-place and had
requested Irma to write to him at times
 Knowing her love of flowers he
