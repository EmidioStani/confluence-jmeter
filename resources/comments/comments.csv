It may be judged with respect to its specificachievement--the material of which it consists or it may be judged withregard to its general utility in the scheme of literature to which itbelongs.In an age which is sometimes ironically called "remarkable" for itscommercialism nothing has been more truly remarkable than theadvancement in learning as well as in material progress and of all theinstruments that have contributed to this end none has been moreeffective perhaps than the practical popularisation of literature.In THE WORLD'S GREATEST BOOKS an attempt has been made to effect a_compendium_ of the world's best literature in a form that shall be atonce _accessible_ to every one and still _faithful_ to its originalsor in other words it has been sought to allow the original author totell his own story over again in his own language but in the shortestpossible space.Such a method differs entirely from all those in which an author isrepresented either by one or more _extracts_ from his work or else bya formal summary or criticism of it in a language not his own. Andsince the style and language of an original is what often constitutesthe wings upon which alone its thought will fly to have access to itsthought without its form is too often to possess a skeleton without thespirit which alone could animate it.Notwithstanding this however we are aware that even THE WORLD'SGREATEST BOOKS will not escape the criticism of a small class of peoplewho will profess to object to this as to any kind of interference withan author's original--in reply to which it can only be said that suchobjections are seldom if ever made in the true interests of learningor in a genuine spirit of inquiry and too often only proceed from aknowledge of books or love of them which goes no deeper than theirtitle-page.For better than all books are the truths which books contain and tocondense those truths into a form that makes them available is not onlyto invest them with new powers and an enlarged range of usefulness butis also not necessarily to interfere with any of those essentialqualities that make up the exquisite literary flavor of a fine original.The selections in THE WORLD'S GREATEST BOOKS have been collected and
comment2,are alphabetically arranged in ten different divisions--namelyFiction Lives and Letters History Religion Philosophy EconomicsScience Poetry and Drama Travel and Adventure and MiscellaneousLiterature.An important additional feature of the work is _the brief yet highlycritical biographical and bibliographical note_ which accompanies everyauthor and every selection throughout the twenty volumes. To this mustbe also added the not less important _Introductories_ and otherexplanations written by experts which often accompany the selections inthe text--cardinal examples of which will be found in particular in thesection of Religion of this work in the articles dealing with suchsubjects as the Book of the Dead Brahmanism Confucianism the KoranTalmud etc.With respect to the selections themselves it may be added that evenwhere they are derived from foreign originals they have often beenprepared from those originals rather than from any existing translationsof them as in the fine translation of Catullus by Professor Wight Duffor the condensations from Euripides Corneille Kant Tacitus and verymany more. In other cases again the selections have been _speciallyprepared for_ THE WORLD'S GREATEST BOOKS _by their authors_ or theiragents such as the two selections by Major Martin Hume in History byDr. Bramwell and Sir Francis Galton in Science by Mr. Robert Hichens inFiction etc. From this and still more from the list of authors itselfit will be found we hope that besides a completely modern aim adistinctly proper proportion of modern literature has found a place inthe work and that the best of French German Scandinavian Russianand other authors take rank in it with American and English as do thebest of the ancients with the best among the moderns.As the aim of THE WORLD'S GREATEST BOOKS has been directed first of alltowards those forms of literature which were in the most need ofcondensation to make them readily available it will not be expectedthat the Poetry section of the work will contain the shorter kind ofpoems. Moreover even if the shortness of such poems and their generalaccessibility in present-day anthologies did not render their inclusionhere a work of supererogation it was felt that their place could be farbetter filled in a work like the present by the world's best _dramatic_literature--as has been done. This does not apply however totranslations from the shorter poems of ancient classical literaturewhich however short they may be cannot be said to be already generallyavailable for everyday reading.Throughout the claims of literature proper or of fine writing havebeen intimately considered in conjunction with the claims of purelearning or of information with the result it is hoped that to theauthority of the world's best thinkers is added the picturesqueness of
comment3,their fine writing. Plato Spencer Newton Darwin Haeckel Virchowschylus Shelley Ibsen Burton Mandeville Loti or Brandes MatthewArnold and Demosthenes--from old and from modern times they yield uptheir pearls.The notion of finality or of an utter inclusiveness for such a work asTHE WORLD'S GREATEST BOOKS may be readily disclaimed. To set it up evenwould seem ridiculous to any one acquainted with the enormous range ofthe subject. Not so ridiculous however may seem the claim to haveestablished a standard and a form of achievement new in the annals ofliterary production and one moreover _whose importance as aneducative factor_ no less than as a test of the special needs of theera wherein we are living may be as valid in its own way and in its owntime as some of those other contributions which have helped along therevival of learning and of letters from that first awakening of theRenascence humanists down to our own day.                                   EDMOND ABOUTThe King of the Mountains     Edmond About was the son of a grocer at Dieuze in Lorraine     France where he was born Feb. 14 1828. Even in childhood he     displayed the vivacity of mind and the irreverent spirit which     were to make him the most entertaining anti-clerical writer of     his period. His tales have the qualities of the best writing     of the eighteenth century enhanced by the modern interest of     his own century. "The King of the Mountains" is the best-known     of his novels as it is also the best. In 1854 About was     working as a poor archaeologist at the French School at     Athens where he noticed there was a curious understanding     between the brigands and the police of modern Hellas.     Brigandage was becoming a safe and almost a respectable Greek     industry. "Why not make it quite respectable and regular"     said About. "Why does not some brigand chief with a good     connection convert his business into a properly registered     joint-stock company" So he produced in 1856 one of the most     delightful of satirical novels "The King of the Mountains."     Edmond About died on January 17 1885 shortly after his     election to the French Academy._I.--The Brigand and His Business_I am no coward still I have some regard for my life. It is a present Ireceived from my parents and I wish to preserve it as long as possiblein remembrance of them. So on my arrival at Athens in April 1856 Irefrained from going into the country.Had the director of the Hamburg Botanical Gardens said to me when I leftGermany "My dear Hermann Schultz I want you to go to Greece and drawup a report on the remarkable system of brigandage obtaining in thatland" I might bravely have begun by going for a ride outside Athens asmy American friends John Harris and William Lobster did. But I hadmerely been sent at a salary of 10 a month to collect the rarerspecimens of the flora of Greece. I therefore began by studying thenative plants in the royal gardens and put off the work of searchingfor new species and varieties.John Harris and William Lobster who lodged with me at the shop of thepastry cook Christodulos in Hermes Street were persons of a moreadventurous temperament. Borrowing the only two horses that Christodulospossessed they rode out into the country. But they had scarcely gone amile when they were stopped by a band of brigands and urgently invitedto pay a visit to the King of the Mountains. The Americans refused togo as the King of the Mountains had an unkindly way of holding hisvisitors to large ransoms and killing them if the money were notquickly paid. But the brigands--there were fourteen of them--insisted
comment4,and got out ropes and began to bind their captives. Neither Harris norLobster was made of the kind of wood of which faggots are composed. Theydrew their revolvers and used them with astonishing effect. They lostthe horses but got safely back to Athens."I suppose I mustn't grumble over two horses" said Christodulos. "Iserved under Hadgi Stavros the King of the Mountains in the War ofIndependence and earned enough money to set up in business."Then over a bottle of Santorin wine Christodulos related the story ofthe great brigand chief. Hadgi Stavros was by far the most popularleader among the insurgent Greeks. His hatred of the Turks did not blindhim to such a point that he passed through a Greek village withoutplundering it. A vigorous impartiality enabled him to advance his fameby increasing his wealth. Lord Byron dedicated an ode to him andsympathisers with the Greek cause throughout Europe sent him subsidies.The result was that when Greece was at last liberated from the TurksHadgi Stavros returned to his old trade with a large capital and agenius for organisation which enabled him to revolutionise the businessof brigandage. He entered into arrangements with army officers andpoliticians and saw to it that his allies were entrusted with thegovernment of his free enlightened and progressive country."But the pity of it is" continued our honest host "that poor HadgiStavros is growing very old and has no son to succeed him. For the sakeof his only daughter he is investing all his wealth in foreign stocksand shares instead of using it to extend his business.""I say I should be glad of an introduction to Miss Stavros" said JohnHarris. "I wouldn't mind throwing up my job as captain of the _Fancy_now lying at the Piraeus in order to marry the richest heiress inGreece. Do you think it is worth getting captured for the sake ofmeeting her"As Christodulos was about to reply the shop-bell rang and a young ladyentered. Like nine out of ten Athenian girls she had plain features.Her teeth were white and even and her hair was beautiful but that wasall. Happily in this world of ours the ugliest little goose generallyfinds some honest gander to admire her. Dimitri the son of the pastrycook ran forward with a cry of delight exclaiming "It's Photini""Gentlemen let us talk of something else" whispered Christodulos. "Wemust not alarm this charming girl with tales about brigands."He then introduced Photini to us. She was it appeared the daughter ofone of his old companions-in-arms Colonel John. Colonel John wasapparently a man of means for Photini was very fashionably dressed andshe was being educated at the best boarding-school in Athens. Her fatherhad asked his old friend to allow Photini to come and chat with us andimprove Her knowledge of French and German. The girl however was tootimid to enter into conversation and to judge by the direction of herglances it was not French or German that she would have liked to speakif she could but English.John Harris I admit is a very good-looking man but the way Photinibegan to devour him with her eyes astonished me. I was sitting next toher at table but she did not utter a word till the end of the meal.
comment5,Then she asked if he were married."No he isn't" I replied adding with a touch of malice "I think hewould be glad of an introduction to you."For something had occurred which made me suspect that she was therichest heiress in Greece. During the meal Dimitri came running in witha newspaper and looking far from happy."Hadgi Stavros has been defeated" he cried. "The troops have burnt hiscamp and broken up his army and pursued him to the marshes ofMarathon.""It's a lie" shouted Christodulos his face red with anger. "The Kingof the Mountains could take Athens if he wanted to and cut the throatof every man in it."This I thought was strange language from an honest pastry cook whowas also a lieutenant in the militia. I was still more surprised when Iturned to Photini and saw that her face was wet with tears."You see my dear Harris" I said when he and Lobster and I weretalking the matter over in my bedroom "you have soon got theintroduction you wanted.""That ugly little over-dressed thing" exclaimed Harris. "I wouldn'tmarry her to save my life.""Well at all events" I said "I shall be able to begin my botanicalresearches to-morrow now that her excellent father has retired to hismountains."_II.--The King of the Mountains Company Limited_The next morning I strapped on my collecting-case and explored MountParnassus. There I came upon Dimitri and two ladies."The old woman is Mrs. Simons English very rich" said Dimitri to me."The pretty girl is her daughter. I'm their guide. I chose thisexcursion in the hope of meeting you. But whatever is the matter withthe women"They shrieked and stared horror-stricken at a clump of bushes. Ilooked in the same direction and perceived half a dozen gun-barrelsgleaming among the leaves. Then eight ruffians appeared and I saw thatthe only difference between devils and brigands is that devils are lessblack than is said and brigands much dirtier than is supposed. Theytook all our money and jewelery and then allowed Dimitri to depart--Iguessed why--and led the two ladies and myself down the hill and up awinding path on to a high plateau where Hadgi Stavros and his band werenow encamped.The King of the Mountains was sitting cross-legged on a square carpetbeneath a pine-tree a little way from his noisy crowded camp. Foursecretaries were writing on their knees to his dictation. He wasundoubtedly a man of majestic appearance. He had a fine figure--tallsupple and marvelously preserved--and calm noble features. The onlyindications of old age were his long white hair and long whitemoustaches. His dress was very simple--a jacket of black cloth immenseblue cotton trousers large boots of Russian leather and a loose redcap. A jeweled belt was the only costly thing he wore.He raised his head at our approach."You are very welcome" he said with great gravity. "Please sit downwhile I finish dictating my letters."His servant brought us refreshments consisting of coffee Turkishdelight and preserved fruit. Having put us at our ease the king wenton with his correspondence."This" he said "is to Messrs. Barley and Co. 31 Cavendish SquareLondon.""Excuse me sire" said his secretary bending over and whispering inhis ear."What does it matter" said the king in a haughty tone. "I've donenothing wrong. Let all the world come and listen if they want to. Nowtake this down."And he dictated the following letter     "GENTLEMEN--I observe by your note of April 5 that I now     have 22750 on current account. Please invest half of this     sum in 3 per cent. Consols and half in bearer bonds before the     coupons are detached. I shall be obliged if you will sell my     shares in the Bank of England and put the proceeds in London     omnibuses. That will be a safe investment and I think a     profitable one. Your obedient servant     "HADGI STAVROS.     "P. S. Oblige me by sending a hundred guineas to Messrs. Ralli     Brothers as my subscription towards the Hellenic School at     Liverpool."Mrs. Simons who like her daughter did not speak Greek leaned towardsme."Mr. Schultz is he dictating the terms of our ransom" she asked."No madam" I replied. "He is writing to his bankers."
comment6,Mrs. Simons turned to the box of Turkish delight. I found more pleasurein listening to the king's business correspondence. It wasextraordinarily interesting.The next letter was addressed to George Micrommati Secretary of theKing of the Mountains Co. Ltd. the Courts of Justice Athens."I am sorry to say" Hadgi Stavros dictated "that the company'soperations have been much restricted owing to the bad harvest and to theoccupation of a part of our beloved land by foreign troops."Our gross receipts from May 1 1855 to April 30 1856 amount only to                                                           fr.                                                         261482   "While our expenses come to                           135482                                                      ----------             "Leaving                                fr. 126000    Which I propose to divide as follows    One-third of the profits payable to me as managing        director                                          40000    Amount added to reserve fund at Bank of Athens         6000    Amount available for dividend                         80000                                                      ----------           "Total                                    fr. 126000"This comes to about 70 per cent on our present capital of 120000francs. It is I know the lowest dividend we have paid since thecompany was formed fourteen years ago. But the shareholders mustconsider the difficulties we have had to struggle against. Our businessis so closely connected with the interests of the country that it canonly flourish in times of general prosperity. From those who havenothing we can take nothing or very little. The tourist seasonhowever has opened very favourably and the affairs of the companywill I think soon improve. I will send you a detailed statement in thecourse of a few days. I am too busy now."The king read over the letters and affixed his seal to them. Then withroyal courtesy instead of having us brought before him on the carpethe came and sat down by our side. Mrs. Simons at once began to talk athim in English. I offered to act as interpreter with a view toprotecting her from herself. The king however thanked me coldly andcalled to one of his brigands who knew English.As I had foreseen Mrs. Simons spoke very largely about her great wealthand her high position. The result was that the king fixed her ransom andthat of Mary Ann at 4000. I was determined that he should notover-estimate my resources."It's no good putting a ransom on me" I exclaimed. "My father is a poorGerman innkeeper who has been ruined by the railway. I've been forced toleave home and come to Greece where I earn a beggarly 10 a month.""If that is so" said the king very kindly "you can return to Athensat once or stay here for a few days.""I shall be happy to stay" I replied "if you will return thecollecting-case your men took from me. I want to go botanising.""What You are a man of science" cried the king joyfully. "Ah how Iadmire knowledge Who sent you here to collect our plants Some famousuniversity I'll be bound.""I'm collecting on behalf of the Hamburg Botanical Gardens" I answered."And do you think my dear friend" said the king "that a greatinstitution like the Hamburg Botanical Gardens would let a man of yourworth perish rather than pay his ransom of 600 Happy young man Younow see the value of a sound scientific education. Had you been anutter ignoramus as I am I wouldn't have asked the ransom of a penny."The king listened neither to my objections nor to the cries of Mrs.
comment7,Simons. He rose up and departed and one of his secretaries led us to aplot of green sward where a meal had been laid for us."The king has ordered everything to be done to make your sojourn aspleasant as possible" he said. "He is sorry that his men were soill-mannered as to rob persons of your importance. Everything they tookwill be returned to you. You have thirty days in which to pay yourransom. Write to your friends without delay as the king never grants anextension of time.""But if I can't get the money" I asked."You will be killed" said the secretary.I did not know what to do. I knew nobody with 100 much less 600. ThenI thought of John Harris."Tell Christodulos" I wrote "that Hadgi Stavros won't let me go. If hewill not intercede for me I leave myself dear friend in your hands. Iknow you are a man of courage and imagination. You will find a way toget me out of this fix."All the same I had very little hope and Hadgi Stavros came up andfound me looking very gloomy."Courage my boy" he said."You know I can't raise 600" I exclaimed. "It's simply murder.""You're a young fool" said the King of the Mountains. "Were I in yourplace my ransom would be paid in two days. Don't you understand Hereyou have an opportunity of winning a charming wife and an immensefortune."Mary Ann was sitting with her mother outside one of the caves in therocky enclosure which were to serve as bedrooms. Close at hand was astream which ran through a hole in the rocks and went tumbling downthe precipitous side of the plateau. I saw that the stretch of greensward between the rocks had been a lake. This suggested to me a way ofescape."Suppose" I said to Mary Ann "that I closed up the hole in the rockswith turf and let the water run into this hollow ground do you thinkwe would be able to climb down by the empty river bed"She got on the rocks and gazed over the precipice. "I could do it if youwould help me.""But I couldn't" said Mrs. Simons very snappishly. "The whole thing'sutterly ridiculous. I've written to the British Ambassador and we shallbe rescued by the royal troops in two days at the latest."I then told her of the "King of the Mountains Co. Ltd.""No doubt" I said "many of the gallant officers IN the Greek Army haveshares in it."_III.--A Way of Escape_And so it proved. Two days afterwards the king was explaining to me his
comment8,scheme for transforming brigandage into a peaceful orderly system oftaxation when four shots were fired in the distance."Get out the Aegean wine" he said. "Pericles is coming with sometroops."Sixty soldiers came marching into the camp. Captain Pericles whosefigure I had often admired at Athens ran up to Hadgi Stavros andkissed him."Good news my dear godfather The paymaster-general is sending 1000to Argos this morning by the path near the Scironian Rocks" said thecaptain."Splendid my boy" said the king. "I'll go with all my men at once.Guard the camp and write out the report of our battle. Defeat me if youlike but leave ten of your best troops dead on the field. I am in needof recruits. Look after the three prisoners. They're worth 4600."As Hadgi Stavros marched out at the head of his men they sang a songcomposed by their king when he knew Lord Byron    Down the winding valleys a hillsman went his way      His eyes were black and flaming his gun was clean and bright    He cried unto the vultures "Oh follow me to-day      And you shall have my foeman to feed upon to-night"When Mrs. Simons saw that the brigands had gone and the troops hadarrived she was wild with excitement. I told her of the real state ofaffairs but she wouldn't believe me and gave Pericles her money andjewels when asked for them. In the evening the king returned with hismen and the troops departed. Mrs. Simons then broke down."If you were an Englishman you would rescue us and marry my daughter"she exclaimed. "I suppose I must write to Barley  Co. and get Edwardto send our ransom.""Barley  Co. of Cavendish Square""Yes" said Mary Ann. "Didn't you know my mother and my uncle werebankers""Then I have found a way of escape" I exclaimed. "Hadgi Stavros bankswith your firm. Do you remember the letter he was dictating when wearrived That was to Barley  Co. about an investment.""I see. I must explain the position at once to him" said Mrs. Simons."And he will want half a million or more ransom" I said. "No Write atonce to your agents in Athens to send you 4600. Pay Hadgi Stavrosmake him give you a receipt. Enclose this in the next letter fromMessrs. Barley  Co. with the note--'Item. 4600 personally remittedby our partner Mrs. Simons as per enclosed receipt.'"I raised my head and saw the sweet brown eyes of Mary Ann looking atme radiant with joy. I then went to Hadgi Stavros and explained thatthe 4600 would be paid into his account at the Bank of Athens on theproduction of his receipt for that amount. He refused at first to give areceipt. He had never done such a thing. Then I took him on his weakside and said that perhaps it was more prudent not to give one. If everhe were captured it might be used against him. This touched him."I will not give one receipt" he cried. "I will give two--one for Mrs.and Miss Simons one for Hermann Schultz."Alas from my point of view the result was deplorable. The ransom of thetwo ladies was paid and they were set free. But as Messrs. Barley  Co.could not recover any money on a receipt given to me their agentrefused to pay my ransom."It doesn't matter" said Mrs. Simons as she and Mary Ann departed."You can escape by the way down the cascade. Your first plan wasimpossible with two women but now you are alone it is admirable. Comeand see us as soon as you get away."That night I made friends with the ruffian set to watch over me and Iplied him with wine until he fell on the grass and was unable to rise. Ithen dammed the stream and climbed down its empty bed. It was difficultwork as the rocks were wet and the night was very dark. I was coveredwith bruises when I reached a platform of rock about ten feet from thebottom of the precipice. Just as I was about to jump down a white formappeared below and a savage growl came from it. I had forgotten thepack of fierce dogs which as the King of the Mountains had told mewere the best of all his sentries. Happily I carried my collectingcase and in it was a packet of arsenic which I used for stuffing birds.
comment9,I put some of the powder on a piece of bread and threw the poisonedfood to the dog but arsenic takes a long time to act. In about half anhour's time the creature began to howl in a frightful manner and it didnot expire until daybreak. It also succeeded in arousing the camp and Iwas recaptured and brought before the king."I don't mind your trying to escape" he said with a terrible look"but in your wild prank you have drowned the man I set to watch overyou. Were I to give way to my feelings I would have you killed. But Iwill be merciful. You will merely be bastinadoed to prevent you fromwandering out of bounds until your ransom is paid."I received twenty strokes on my feet. At the third I began to bleed. Atthe fourth I began to howl. At the tenth I was insensible to pain. WhenI came to I was in such an agony that I would have given my soul to killHadgi Stavros. I tried to but failed. But I would hurt him though Iknew I should die for it. So with a torrent of invectives I explainedhow I tricked him over the ransom of Mrs. Simons and her daughter."She's a partner in Barley's Bank you fool you ass" I shrieked. "Shewill get back all the 4000 on your receipt."Hadgi Stavros turned pale and trembled."No" he said very slowly "I will not kill you. You have not sufferedenough. Four thousand pounds It is a fortune. You have stolen mydaughter's fortune. What can I do to you Find me you brutes" hecried turning to his men "a torture of 4000."Then he left me in their hands."Treat him gently" he said. "I don't want him to get so exhausted thathe dies before I begin to play with him."As a beginning they stripped me to the waist and their cook put meclose to a great fierce fire where some lambs were being fried. The redcinders fell about me and the heat was unsupportable. I dragged myselfaway on my hands--I could not use my feet--but the ruffian kicked meback. Then he left me for a moment to get some salt and pepper. Iremembered that I had put the arsenic in my trousers pocket. With asupreme effort I rose up and scattered the powder over the meat."What are you doing" said the cook. "Trying to cast a spell on ourfood"He had only seen from a distance the motion of my hand. I was avengedSuddenly I heard a cry "The king Where is the king" And Dimitri theson of Christodulos came running up."Good God" he said when he saw me. "The poor girl"The cook was so astonished that he forgot me for a minute and I managedto crawl away and lay on the cold grass. Then Hadgi Stavros appeared.With a cry of anguish he took me gently in his arms and carried me tothe cave among the rocks."Poor boy" he said. "How you have suffered But you will soon be well.I once had sixty strokes of the bastinado and two days afterwards I wasdancing the Romaika. It was this ointment that cured me.""But what has happened" I murmured."Read that" he cried throwing me a letter. "What a pirate What anassassin If I only had you and your friend one in each hand Oh hewon't do it Will he"The letter was from John Harris. It ran     "Hadgi Stavros--Photini is now on my ship the _Fancy_     which carries four guns. She remains a hostage as long as     Hermann Schultz remains a prisoner. As you treat my friend so     I will treat your daughter. She shall pay hair for hair tooth     for tooth head for head. Answer at once or I will come and     see you.--JOHN HARRIS.""I know Photini" I said to the king "and I swear that she will not beharmed. But I must return to Athens at once. Get four of your men tocarry me down the mountains in a litter."The king rose up and then groaned and staggered. I remembered thearsenic. He must have eaten some of the meat. I tickled the inside ofhis throat and he brought up most of the poison. Soon afterwards theother brigands came up to the enclosure screaming with pain and wantedto murder me. I had cast a spell over their meat and it was torturingthem they cried. I must be killed at once and then the spell would beremoved. The king commanded them to withdraw. They resisted. He drew hissaber and cut down two of the ringleaders. The rest seized their guns
comment10,and began to shoot. There were about sixty of them all suffering moreor less from the effects of arsenic poisoning. We were only twelve innumber but our men had the steadier aim and the king fought like ahero though his hands and feet were swelling painfully.The fact was that he had eaten some time before his men and I could nottherefore get the poison completely out of his system. But it was thearsenic that saved his life. He had at last to come and lie down besideme. We heard the sound of rapid firing in the distance and suddenly twomen entered our enclosure with revolvers in each hand and shot downour defenders with an extraordinary quickness of aim. They were Harrisand Lobster."Hermann where are you" Harris yelled at last with all his strengthas he turned and found nothing more to shoot at."Here" I replied. "The men you've just killed have been fighting forme. There has been civil war in the camp.""Well we've stamped it out" said Harris. "What's the matter with theold scoundrel lying beside you""It's Hadgi Stavros" I said. "He and his men have been eating somearsenic I had in my collecting case."My friends managed to carry me down the mountain and at the firstvillage we came to they got a carriage and took me to Athens. Theointment used by Hadgi Stavros was as he had said marvelous and intwo days I could walk as well as ever. I at once called on Mrs. and MissSimons."They departed yesterday for Trieste" said the servant "on their wayto London."As I was returning to Hermes Street I met Hadgi Stavros and Photini."How is it that the King of the Mountains is found walking in thestreets of Athens" I said."What can I do in the mountains now" he replied. "All my men arekilled wounded or fled. I might get others. But look at my swollenhands. How can I use a sword No let some one younger now take myplace. But I defy him to equal me in fame or fortune. And I have notdone yet. Before six months are gone you will see Hadgi Stavros PrimeMinister of Greece. Oh there are more ways of making money than one"And that was the last I saw of the King of the Mountains. On the adviceof Harris I at once returned to Hamburg lest some of the remainingbrigands found me out and take vengeance for the spell I had cast ontheir meat. But some day I hope to go to London and call at 31Cavendish Square.                                   HARRISON AINSWORTHTower of London     William Harrison Ainsworth born at Manchester England Feb.     4 1805 was a popular rather than a great writer. A     solicitor's son he was himself trained in the law but some     adventures in journalism led him finally to the literary life     his first success as a writer of romance being scored with     "Rookwood" in 1834. "Tower of London" was the fourth work of     the novelist and according to Ainsworth himself it was     written chiefly with the aim of interesting his     fellow-countrymen in the historical associations of the Tower.     From the popularity of the romance it is reasonable to suppose     that it fulfilled its author's hopes in this respect though     it must be confessed its history leaves a good deal to be     desired. Here is not the place to discuss the rights and     wrongs of Ainsworth's bold liberties in respect to the     historical personages he introduces but there is no doubt     that the romance is told with vigour and dramatic movement     and it is an excellent example of the novelist's spirited     style of narrative though judged on purely literary merits     like his other works the "Tower of London" will not bear     comparison with the masterpieces of Sir Walter Scott in the     field of historical romance. Ainsworth died at Reigate on     January 3 1882._I.--Prisoners in the Tower_
comment11,Edward VI. was dead poisoned it was rumoured by the Duke ofNorthumberland Grandmaster of the Realm. For three days had an attemptbeen made to keep his death secret so that the proud and ambitious dukemight seize the persons of the Princess Mary and the Princess Elizabeth.But the former warned in time had escaped the snare and the Duke ofNorthumberland finding further dissimulation useless boldly proclaimedhis daughter-in-law Lady Jane Grey queen.On July 10 1553 Queen Jane the wisest and most beautiful woman in thekingdom though only sixteen years of age was conducted in state to theTower where it was the custom for the monarchs of England to spend thefirst few days of their reign.But the crowds who watched her departure from Durham House in theStrand were silent and sullen. Her youthful beauty and grace might winan involuntary cry of admiration but the heart of the people was nothers. They recognised that she was but the tool of her father-in-lawwhom because of his overweening ambition they hated.All the pride and pomp of silken banners and cloth of gold could notmask the gloomy presage of the young queen's reign. The very heavensthundered and owing to the press of boats that surrounded theprocession many small craft were overturned and their occupants throwninto the water. And if further signs of portending evil were wantedthey could be discerned in the uneasy whisperings of those lords of thePrivy Council who were present or in the sinister face of the SpaniardSimon Renard ambassador to the Emperor Charles V."This farce will not last long" he said to De Noailles the Frenchambassador. "The Privy Council are the duke's secret enemies andthrough them I shall strike the scepter from Jane's grasp and place itin the hand of Mary."Elsewhere in the procession Cranmer Archbishop of Canterbury utteredin a low voice to Ridley Bishop of London his fears for the futurewhile certain lords of the Privy Council who had planned theassassination of the Duke of Northumberland and were aware that theirplot had been discovered approached the portals of the Tower in fearand trembling.But there was one man at least who did not share the general depressionand uneasiness. Cuthbert Cholmondeley esquire to Lord Guildford Dudleyhusband of Queen Jane found much to interest him in the scene. Thereception of her Majesty by Og Gog and Magog had already driven awaythe sense of portending evil from his mind when he caught sight of agirl's face in the crowd. It was only for a moment that he had sight ofit but it left such a deep impression on his mind that for the rest ofthe day he burned with impatience to discover who the girl might be.Much had to happen before he could satisfy his curiosity. Once in theTower plots against Queen Jane and the Duke of Northumberland began tothicken. At a meeting of the Privy Council the duke compelled the lordsunder threat of imprisonment to sign a proclamation declaring PrincessMary illegitimate. Renard lost no time in turning to his own advantagethe bad impression created by these tactics."Do you consent to Northumberland's assassination" he whispered to
comment12,Pembroke."I do" replied the Earl of Pembroke. "But who will strike the blow""I will find the man."This sinister fragment of conversation fell upon the ears of Cuthbert.He at once sent a warning missive to his master telling him of the plotagainst the duke's life. Then this duty performed he set out to tryand find the girl whose face had so impressed him. From the giantwarders he learnt that she was the adopted daughter of Dame PotentiaTrusbut wife of Peter the pantler of the Tower. A mystery surroundedher birth. Her mother had been imprisoned in the Tower by Henry VIII.and in her dungeon had given birth to Cicely--such was the name of thegirl.Magog seeing Cuthbert's interest good-naturedly carried him off withhim to the pantler's quarters. Here a gargantuan feast was in progressto which the three giants did full justice devouring whole joints andpasties and quaffing vast flagons of wine to the great delight of thepantler and his wife. But Cuthbert had no eyes except for Cicely. He wasnot content until he was by her side and was able to hear her voice. Theattraction between them was mutual and it was not long before they werewhispering the first words of love into one another's ears.While all was merriment Renard and Pembroke made their appearanceunobserved. They had intercepted Cuthbert's letter and were anxious tosatisfy themselves as to the identity of the rash youth who had dared tocross their path."Though we have intercepted his missive to Lord Dudley" whisperedRenard "he may yet betray us. He must not return to the palace.""He shall never return my lords" said a tall dark man advancingtowards them "if you will entrust his detention to me.""Who are you" demanded Renard eyeing him suspiciously."Lawrence Nightgall the chief gaoler.""What is your motive for this offer""Look there" returned Nightgall. "I love that damsel. He has supplantedme but he shall not profit by his good fortune.""You are the very man I want" cried Renard rubbing his handsgleefully. "Lead me where we can speak more freely."The three withdrew unobserved. Half an hour later Cuthbert draggedhimself unwillingly from Cicely's side and passed into the open air. Ashe did so he received a blow on the back of his head which stretched himunconscious on the ground.When he came to his senses he found himself bound by a chain in a gloomydungeon a ghastly dreadful place but a few feet in height. His firstinstinct was to try to loosen his bonds but after vainly lacerating hishands he sank down exhausted.Terrible recollections flashed upon his mind of the pitiless sufferingshe had heard that the miserable wretches immured in these dungeonsendured before death.For a time these mental tortures were acute but at last nature assertedherself and he sank exhausted into sleep. He was awakened by a cry andperceived the tall skeleton figure of a woman standing by him. Sheplaced a thin and bony hand upon his shoulder. He shrank back as far ashis chain would permit horror-stricken. The figure pursued himshrieking "My child My child You have taken my child"Suddenly she stopped and stood erect. A distant footstep was heard."He comes He comes" she cried and with a loud shriek dashed from thedungeon and disappeared.In another second Nightgall stood before him. The gaoler made no attemptto disguise the motives which prompted him to imprison the youngesquire. No threats that Cuthbert could use had the least effect on him.
comment13,He quailed before the charge that Cuthbert made at random--that he hadmurdered the child of the unfortunate wretch who had disappeared at hiscoming but on the question of his release he was obdurate. If Cuthbertwould agree to give up Cicely he should be released otherwise he shouldmeet with a secret death at the hands of Mauger the executioner.At this juncture Cicely who had been directed by the dwarf Xitappeared. To save the man she loved she boldly declared that she wouldwed Nightgall provided that he would conduct his prisoner outside thewalls of the Tower."Bring me back some token that you have done so and I am yours" shesaid.Nightgall consented and agreed to withdraw while Cuthbert and Cicelyarranged privately what the token should be.Hurriedly Cuthbert gave her a ring to send to Lord Dudley who he knewwould at once effect his release. Then accompanied by Nightgall Cicelywithdrew from the gloomy dungeon.Unable to deliver the ring herself to Lord Dudley Cicely entrusted thattask to Xit. But the vanity of the dwarf prevented the execution of theplan. As he was exhibiting the ring to Og Nightgall suddenlyapproached and snatched it from him and without taking any notice ofthe little man's threats made his way to Cicely. When he displayed thering as the token that her lover had been set free Cicely shrieking"Lost Lost" fell senseless on the floor._II.--The Twelfth Day Queen_While Renard's intrigues were maturing and the Duke of Northumberlandhad left the Tower on a campaign against the Princess Mary CuthbertCholmondeley was kept languishing in his terrible dungeon.At long intervals Nightgall visited him and once the wretched prisonerwhom the gaoler called Alexia came to him entreating his help againstNightgall.At last Cuthbert decided upon a daring plan of escape. After severaldays' imprisonment he feigned to be dead. Nightgall seeing himstretched on the ground apparently lifeless chuckled with delightand releasing the chain that bound his leg bent over him with theintention of carrying his body into the burial vault near the moat. Buta suspicion crossed his mind and he drew his dagger determined to makesure that his prisoner had passed away. As he did so the young esquire
comment14,sprang to his feet and wrested the poniard from his grasp. In anothersecond Nightgall was lying chained to the floor where his prisoner hadbeen a moment before.Despite the gaoler's threats Cuthbert set out determined to liberateAlexia and made good his own escape. He wandered through the terribletorture chambers released an old man confined in a cell called LittleEase a cell so low and so contrived that the wretched inmate could notstand walk sit or lie at full length within and then unable todiscover the whereabouts of the ill-fated Alexia returned to thegaoler and possessing himself of his keys and cloak started forthonce more. After wandering for a long time chance at last brought himto a secret door which led into St. John's Chapel in the White Tower.While these events were in progress Cicely despairing of her lover'ssafety sought an audience of Queen Jane and poured out her story.Moved by compassion the queen gave directions for a search to be madeand delighted by the grace and charm of Cicely appointed her one ofher attendants. Lord Guildford Dudley procuring the assistance ofMagog burst open the door leading to the subterranean dungeons beneaththe Devilin Tower and eventually discovered Nightgall who made a fullconfession of his crime as the price of his release.Cholmondeley's arrival in St. John's Chapel was opportune. Renard withPembroke by his side had just demanded the resignation of the crown byQueen Jane and the queen helpless but courageous had ordered LordPembroke to arrest the Spaniard. Pembroke had refused to move and atthis juncture Cholmondeley stepped forward and advancing towards theambassador said "M. Simon Renard you are the queen's prisoner."The Spaniard drew his sword and with the assistance of the Earl ofPembroke kept Cuthbert at bay until they were both able to slip throughthe secret door.Next day Queen Jane was forced by the Privy Council to resign hercrown and that same night accompanied by Cuthbert and Cicely sheescaped by a secret passage from the Tower and taking a boat made herway to Sion House. Here the following day she and her husband werearrested and learnt the news that the Duke of Northumberland was incaptivity and that Queen Mary had ascended the throne. Once more LadyJane was led back to the Tower and as she entered by the Traitors' Gateshe saw Renard standing hard by with a smile of bitter mockery in hisface."So" he said "Epiphany is over. The Twelfth Day Queen has played herpart."_III.--The Price of Pardon_Simon Renard's influence was now for the time supreme. At hisinstigation the Duke of Northumberland was tricked into a confession ofthe Roman Catholic faith on the scaffold and then executed. Ambitiousthat Mary should marry Philip of Spain he contrived by intrigue to killher affection for Courtenay the young Earl of Devon and succeeded sosuccessfully that Courtenay was placed under arrest and the PrincessElizabeth with whom the earl had fallen in love became the victim ofher sister's jealousy. Cuthbert though not confined in a cell was keptprisoner in the Tower and occupied quarters in the pantler's house.Cicely had disappeared and nothing had been heard of her since thearrest of Lady Jane Grey at Sion House.
comment15,Consumed with anxiety for the safety of the girl he loved the esquirebegan to suspect that she had been kidnapped by Nightgall. He determinedto find her at all cost and getting Xit to steal the gaoler's keys heonce more made his way to the subterranean dungeons.Cell after cell he searched but nowhere could he find a trace of hisbeloved Cicely. All that he discovered was the dead body of Alexia. Hemade haste to return to his quarters and had almost reached them whenNightgall appeared and at once placed him under arrest for stealing hiskeys.His enemy was now at his mercy and Nightgall after burying the body ofAlexia sought out Cicely whom be had kept for several weeks a closeprisoner in the Salt Tower. He told her that he was about to remove herto another prison in the Tower leading to the Iron Gate."I will never go thither of my own accord" replied Cicely shrinkingterrified from him. "Release me villain I will die sooner than becomeyour bride.""We shall see that" growled the gaoler seizing hold of her. "You shallnever be set free unless you consent to be mine."He carried her shrieking and struggling in his arms out of the roomand dragged her by main force down the secret staircase. She continuedher screams until her head striking against the stones she wasstunned by the blow and became insensible. Nightgall raised her andcarried her quickly to the dark cell he had already prepared. Here shewould have languished for months without seeing anybody save Nightgallexcept for a curious chain of circumstances.Renard's plan of marrying Mary to Philip of Spain to which end he hadhad Courtenay and the Princess Elizabeth imprisoned in the Tower wasbitterly opposed by De Noailles. The French ambassador determined toprevent the Spaniard's plans and by means of Xit sent a communicationto the princess just as she was leaving her prison for Ashbridge.Further the little mannikin managed to creep by way of the chimneyinto the chamber where Courtenay was confined and arrange a plan bywhich the Earl was able to escape. His share in these events howeverwas discovered and much to his amazement he was arrested and taken tothe torture chamber. Though none of the instruments were small enough toinflict much pain upon him he was so terrified that he answered everyquestion that Renard asked him giving those answers that he thought theSpaniard would approve. The examination over he was placed in a cell.Here he was visited by Nightgall from whose girdle he managed to cutunobserved the bunch of keys.Unlocking his own door he hurried out into the labyrinth of passagesand cells and in his wanderings in search of an exit lighted upon thecell in which Cicely was confined. He was not able to effect her escapefor as they were setting out Nightgall appeared and put an end to their
comment16,hopes.Cuthbert had meanwhile been released together with Lady Jane and herhusband. For a time they lived together quietly in Sion House but DeNoailles' plan to prevent the Spanish marriage at all costs dragged themonce more into the whirlpool.Under the leadership of Sir Thomas Wyatt an insurrection took placehaving for its nominal object the prevention of Mary's marriage withPhilip of Spain but it was joined by all the forces opposed to thecrown. Courtenay shared in it because he hoped to wed Elizabeth whowould be made Queen on the deposition of Mary. Lord Guildford Dudleyjoined in it in the anticipation that his wife might once more mount thethrone.At first Wyatt carried everything before him. Mary was actually besiegedin the Tower which it was attempted to carry by force. Supported byCuthbert Lord Guildford led the assault shouting "Long live QueenJane Down with Renard and the See of Rome" The attack had almostsucceeded when Dudley was struck from behind by Renard and takenprisoner.Cuthbert only escaped by forcing himself through an aperture anddropping into the moat from where he managed to swim ashore. He madehis way at once to Lady Jane and related to her how the insurrectionhad collapsed and how her husband had been taken prisoner. For her ownsafety Jane had no thought. She at once determined to seek out thequeen and beseech her to spare her husband.Accompanied by Cuthbert she presented herself at the Tower andobtaining an audience with Mary flung herself at her feet."I am come to submit myself to your highness's mercy" she said as soonas she could find utterance."Mercy" exclaimed Mary scornfully. "You shall receive justice but nomercy.""I do not sue for myself" rejoined Jane "but for my husband. I havecome to offer myself for him. If your highness has any pity for meextend it to him and heap his faults on my head."Queen Mary was deeply moved. Had not Gardiner intervened she wouldundoubtedly have granted the request but Gardiner suggested that theprice of the pardon should be the public reconciliation of Lady Jane andher husband with the Church of Rome."I cannot" said Jane. "I will die for him but I cannot destroy my soulalive."_IV.--The Torture Chamber and the Block_After a week's imprisonment Cuthbert was closely questioned and hisanswers being deemed unsatisfactory he was ordered to be examined undertorture. With fiendish delight Nightgall took him to the horriblechamber. There the first thing that he saw was the tortured mangledfigure of Lord Dudley covered from head to foot by a blood-colouredcloth."You here" cried the ghastly distorted figure. "Where is Jane Has shefled Has she escaped""She has surrendered herself" replied Cholmondeley "in the hope ofobtaining your pardon.""False hope Delusive expectation" exclaimed Dudley in tones ofanguish as he was carried from the room. "She will share my fate. OhGod I am her destroyer"Cholmondeley as soon as his master had been borne away was seized bythe torturers and placed on the rack. He determined that not a soundshould escape him and though his whole frame seemed rent asunder hebravely kept his resolve."Go on" cried Nightgall as the torturers paused. "Turn the rolleragain."Even as he spoke Cholmondeley fainted and finding that no answerscould be extracted from him he was taken back to his cell and flungupon a heap of straw. As he lay there Nightgall with diabolicalcruelty brought Cicely to his side and bade her look on his nervelessarms and crippled limbs and mockingly offered to set him free if Cicelywould marry him of her own free will. When at Cuthbert's instigation sherefused he forced her away shrieking for help.Cuthbert sank once more into insensibility. He came to his senses againto find that men were chafing his limbs and bathing his temples andthat Renard was in his cell. At the Spaniard's order he was given a cup
comment17,of wine and the rest having withdrawn Renard questioned him further.While this examination was going on the cell door opened softly and amasked figure appeared. It was Nightgall who bribed by De Noailleshad come to assassinate Renard. He flung himself on his intended victimand was about to dispatch him with his poniard when Cuthbert summoningup all his strength intervened.Finding that he had two men to deal with instead of one the gaolersprang to his feet and rushed from the dungeon. Renard followed himfurious with rage and Cuthbert at once took advantage of theopportunity to escape.After some search he discovered the whereabouts of Cicely and togetherthe lovers happy once more at being united if only for a short timesucceeded in finding their way out of the dungeons. As soon as theyemerged into the open air they were arrested by the warders and takento the guard-room in the White Tower where Cicely received a warmwelcome from the three giants. There was no time to relate theiradventures before Renard appeared walking before a litter upon whichwas borne the mangled body of Nightgall who in his attempt to escapethe Spaniard's sword had been forced to jump from an embrasure of theWhite Tower.The wretch was dying but with his last breath he attempted to make someamends for all the evil he had done in his life. Bidding Cicely come tohis side he told her that she was the daughter of Alexia whose realname was Lady Mountjoy and he gave her papers proving her right to theestates of her father Sir Alberic Mountjoy who had incurred thevengeance of Henry VIII.Renard grateful to Cholmondeley for saving his life secured hispardon.Cicely also returned to the side of Lady Jane Grey and watched thesplendid fortitude and unswerving courage with which her unfortunatemistress prepared for the scaffold. The day before her death her wishthat Cicely and Cuthbert should be united was granted and they weremarried in her presence by Master John Bradford Prebendary of St.Paul's.At last Monday the twelfth of February 1544 dawned and Lady JaneGrey was led out to the scaffold. On the way she passed the headlesscorpse of Lord Guildford being borne to the grave. Cicely accompanied
comment18,the beautiful girl to the last. It was her hands that helped her toremove her attire and that tied the handkerchief over those eyes whichwere never to look on the world again.Blindfolded Jane groped for the block crying "What shall I do Whereis it"She was guided to the place and laying her head on the block cried"Lord--into Thy hands I commend my spirit"The axe then fell and one of the fairest and wisest heads that ever saton human shoulders fell also.                                   HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSENThe Improvisatore     Hans Christian Andersen was born at Odense in Denmark on     April 2 1805 the son of a poor bootmaker. His life was full     of exciting incidents his early years in particular     constitute a record of hard struggle poverty and lack of     recognition. When nine he tried his hand at tragedy and     comedy and was sent after his father's death in 1819 to     Copenhagen where he engaged in various occupations with     little success until his talents attracted the attention of a     few influential personages who provided him with the means     for continuing his studies. He won considerable reputation     with some early poems and was quite well known to the public     before he entered the university in 1828. He next published a     satirical story and after a journey in Italy his famous     novel "The Improvisatore" which gave him an opportunity for     a brilliant series of word-pictures describing the life and     character of the parts of Italy he had visited. Apart from his     world-famous fairy tales by which he set no great store     being ambitious of fame as a novelist he wrote several     successful plays epic poems and novels. His fairy tales have     been translated practically into every language. Hans Andersen     died at the age of seventy in Copenhagen on August 4 1875._I.--A Boyhood in Rome_My earliest recollections take me back to my tender youth when I livedwith my widowed mother in a little garret in a Roman square. Shesupported us by sewing and by the rent of a larger room sublet to ayoung painter. On the house opposite there was an image of the Virginbefore which when the evening bells rang I and the neighbours'
comment19,children used to kneel and sing in honour of the Mother of God and theChild Jesus. Once an English family stopped to listen and the gentlemangave me a silver coin "because of my fine voice" as my mother told me.My mother's confessor Fra Martino always showed great kindness to meand I spent many hours with him at the convent. It was through him thatI became chorister in the Capuchin church and was allowed to carry thegreat censer.Before I was nine I was chosen as one of the boys and girls who were topreach between Christmas and the New Year in the church of Ara Croelibefore the image of Jesus. I had no fear and it seemed decided that Iof all children gave most delight but after me came a little girl ofexquisitely delicate form bright countenance and so melodious a voicethat even my mother with all her pride of me awarded her the palm anddeclared that she was just like an angel. But I had often to repeat myspeech at home and then made up a new one describing the festival inthe church which was considered just as good.One moonlit evening on returning with my mother from a visit inTrastevere we found a crowd in the Piazza di Trevi listening to a mansinging to a guitar--not songs like those which I had so often heardbut about things around him of what we saw and heard and we ourselveswere in the song. My mother told me he was an improvisatore andFederigo our artist lodger told me I should also improvise for I wasreally a poet. And I tried it forthwith--singing about the foodshop overthe way with its attractively set out window and the hagglingcustomers. I gained much applause and from this time forth I turnedeverything into song.My first visit to the country ended in a sad event which was to shapethe whole course of my life. It was in June and my mother and herfriend Mariuccia took me to see the famous flower fte at Genzano. Westayed the night at an inn and in the morning joined the dense holidaycrowd that moved over the carpet of flowers on the pavement of the mainstreet. Suddenly there was a piercing cry--a pair of unmanageable horsesrushed through. I was thrown down and all was blackness. When I awokeMother of God I lay with my head on Mariuccia's lap beside thelifeless form of my mother crushed by the carriage wheel The occupantof the carriage a gentleman of the Borghese family had escaped with ashaking and sent a servant in rich livery with a purse containingtwenty scudi for the motherless child.Mariuccia took me back to Rome it was decided that her parents whokept flocks in the Campagna--honest people to whom my twenty scudi wouldbe wealth--should take charge of me. Thus in the dreary Campagna withhonest Benedetto and kindly Domenica I spent the summer and the earlyautumn in the ancient tomb which they had transformed into a hut. Thefirst week it rained incessantly then with the sun came theinsufferable heat increasing in intensity from day to day from week toweek. Even the buffaloes lay like dead masses upon the burnt-up grassunless excited to madness by the poison-stings of myriads of fliesthat covered them as if they were carrion they rushed in mad career tothe Tiber to roll themselves in the yellow water.One day towards sunset I was just opening the door to leave the hutwhen a man darted in so suddenly that I was thrown down. With lightningspeed he shut the door and in a distressed tone uttered the name of theMadonna when a violent blow shattered the door and the whole openingwas filled with the head of a fierce buffalo whose body was tightlysqueezed into the doorway. The stranger seized a gun from the wall took
comment20,aim and shot the beast. The danger over he lifted me from the groundand said "Blessed be Madonna You have saved my life." He inquiredabout me. I was made to show him my abominable sketches upon bits ofpaper and to sing to him and caused him astonishment at my improvisingabout the Madonna and himself and the buffalo. He finally asked Domenicato bring me next morning to see him at the Borghese Palace. He was thepowerful prince himself who had unwittingly been the cause of my poormother's death_II.--In the School of Life_The prince his daughter Francesca and her fiance Fabiani overwhelmedme with kindness. The visit had to be frequently repeated and I becamequite accustomed to the splendours of the palazzo. Finally Eccellenzadecided to have me educated in the Jesuits' school and I had to bidfarewell to good Domenica and to enter upon my school life. Newoccupations engrossed me new acquaintances presented themselves thedramatic portion of my life began to unfold itself. Here years compressthemselves together.I became particularly attached to one of my school-fellows Bernardo agay almost dissolute son of a Roman senator. When he suddenly leftschool to join the Papal Guard the whole world seemed to me empty anddeserted. One day I saw him pass my window on a prancing horse. I rushedout but ran across the porter's wife of the Borghese Palace whoinformed me that the young Eccellenza and her husband had just arrived.Would I not come to give them welcome To the palace I went wasgraciously received by Fabiani and Francesca who brought me theirlittle daughter Flaminia the "little abbess" as she was called havingbeen destined from her birth for the life of a nun. The child hadwonderfully bright eyes and came towards me as though we were oldacquaintances laughing and chattering and showing me her toys.On my way back early in the evening as luck would have it I almostran into the arms of Bernardo. He was delighted to see me told me ofhis merry life and adventures and wanted to drag me into an artists'tavern to drink a bottle of wine. That was impossible for me a Jesuits'pupil. I refused. As we walked on we met a crowd hustling an old Jew. Athick-set brute of a fellow wanted to force him to jump over a longstick and everybody shouted "Leap Jew" Bernardo sprang forthsnatched the stick out of the fellow's hand brandished his sword and
comment21,cried in a strong manly voice "Leap yourself or I shall cleave yourhead" He made him jump and jump again and struck him lightly with theflat of his sword. The crowd veered round at once laughed andapplauded the old Jew meanwhile making his escape. "Come" said I whenwe were out of the crowd "come Let them say what they may I willdrink a bottle of wine with you. May we always be friends"I met Bernardo again some time after at the Vatican. His joy equalledmine and he immediately plunged into confidences. One day whenstraying into the Ghetto he had encountered the old Jew of ouradventure bowing and scraping and requesting the honour of receivinghim in his house. They entered wine was brought to him by a dark Jewishmaiden of such beauty as to set his whole blood on fire. Since then hehad vainly tried to see her. He visited the Jew's house on all sorts ofpretexts but his charmer remained invisible. He now made the amazingproposition that I should take up the study of Hebrew with the old Jewand thus help him in this affair. I explained the utter impossibility ofaiding him in a project of this nature. He was obviously offended andwhen we parted he returned my warmth with chilly politeness.We met but rarely after this meeting Bernardo was always jovial andfriendly though not confidential until on the occasion of a dance atthe Borghese Palace when I asked him about the handsome Jewish maidenhe laughed. "I have found" he said "another and tamer little goldenbird. The other has flown out of the Ghetto--nay even out of Rome"My patron's family left Rome and I had to throw myself into the studyfor the examination that was to bring me the title of an abb. With theadvent of the carnival I had assumed the black dress and the short silkcoat of an abbate and had become a new and happier person. For thefirst time I took part in the jollities of the carnival and at the endof the first day again came across Bernardo who insisted upon taking meto the opera to hear a new prima donna who had turned everybody's heartat Naples. Rumour had not belied her. Her appearance was greeted withrapturous applause. Bernardo seized my arm he had recognised in her hisJewish maiden just as I was about to exclaim "It is she"--the lovelychild who had preached that Christmas at Ara Coeli. There were endlesscalls for "Annunciata" when the curtain fell flowers and garlands werethrown at her feet and among them a little poem which I had writtenunder the inspiration of her exquisite voice. With a crowd ofenthusiasts we hurried to the stage-door took the horses from hercarriage and conducted her in triumph to her apartments.Bernardo who bolder than I had called on Annunciata brought me toher the next day. She was friendly brilliant in her conversation andappeared deeply impressed with my improvisation on "Immortality"--theimmortality first of eternal Rome and then of the fair singer's art--to
comment22,which I was pressed when Bernardo let out the secret of my gift."You have given me the sincerest pleasure" she said and lookedconfidingly into my eyes. I ventured to kiss her hand. After that I sawher every day during the gay carnival and was more and more captivatedby her charm.Annunciata left Rome on Ash Wednesday and with her the brightnessseemed to have gone completely out of my life my only pleasure beingthe recollection of those happy days of the carnival._III.--Love and Adventure in Rome_I saw Annunciata again when Rome had begun to fill with Easter visitorsand had the happiness of dining with her the same day. She told me thatalthough born in Spain she had been as a child in Rome that it wasshe who preached that day at Ara Coeli "an orphan who would haveperished of hunger had not a despised Jew given it shelter and fooduntil it could flutter forth over the wild restless sea." Next day Ishowed her over the Borghese gallery and on the day before Easter wedrove out to see the procession which initiated the Easter festival andin the evening to Monte Mario to see the illuminations of St. Peter's--an unforgettable sightAs I went into the little inn to fetch some refreshment I found myselfin the narrow passage face to face with Bernardo pale and with glowingeyes. He wildly seized my hand and said "I am not an assassinAntonio but fight with me you shall or I shall become your murderer"I tried to calm him but he forced a pistol into my hand. "She lovesyou" he whispered "and you in your vanity will parade it before allthe Roman people--before me" He threw himself upon me. I thrust himback. I heard a report my hand trembled. Bernardo lay before me in hisblood. The people of the house rushed in and with them Annunciata. Iwanted to fling myself in despair upon Bernardo's body but Annunciatalay on her knees beside him trying to staunch the blood. "Saveyourself" she cried. But I overcome by anguish exclaimed "I aminnocent the pistol went off by accident. Yes Annunciata we lovedyou. I would die for you like he Which of us was the dearer to youTell me whether you love me and then I will escape." She bowed her headdown to the dead. I heard her weeping and saw her press her lips toBernardo's brow. Then I heard voices shout "Fly fly" and as byinvisible hands I was torn out of the house.Like a madman I rushed through bushes and underwood until I reached theTiber. Among the ruins of a tomb I came across three men sitting arounda fire to whom I explained that I wanted a boat to cross the river.They agreed to take me across but I had better give them my money tokeep for safety. I realised that I had fallen into the hands of robbersgave them all I had was tied on to a horse and taken across the riverriding all night until at dawn we reached a wild part of the mountains.They wanted to keep me for ransom and dispatched one of their number toRome to find out all he could about me. The man returned and with athankful heart I heard that Bernardo was only wounded and on the way torecovery.My rough hosts having found out my gift I was asked to sing to themand once more my power of improvisation stood me in good stead. When Ihad finished a wrinkled old woman who seemed to be held in greatreverence by the robbers came towards me. "Thou hast sung thy ransom"she exclaimed. "The sound of music is stronger than gold" Yet I wasdetained six days during which there were mysterious comings andgoings. The old witch herself who had made me write on a piece of paperthe words "I travel to Naples" and my name disappeared for a day andcame back with a letter which she commanded me not to read then.Finally in the midst of night she led me out of the robbers' den and
comment23,took me across a rocky path to a dumb peasant with an ass which I wasmade to mount. She kissed my forehead and departed. When daylight brokeI opened the letter which contained a passport in my name an order forfive hundred scudi on a Naples bank and the words "Bernardo is out ofdanger but do not return to Rome for some months."When I joined the high-road I took carriage for Naples. Among mytravelling companions was a portly handsome Neapolitan lady with whomI became very friendly and who invited me to her house. She was thewife of a Professor Maretti and her name was Santa. The professorhimself was a little half-famished looking man full of learning by theshow of which he was in the habit of boring everybody who came near him.Santa made up for this by her liveliness and her warm interest in myaffairs. Amid music and laughter I spent many happy hours in her housemade friends and was encouraged to make my dbut as an improvisatore. Ihad written to Eccellenza a true account of the reason of my departureand informed him of my future intentions but his reply which arrivedafter long delay was a stunning blow to me. He was exceedingly annoyedwashed his hands of me and wished me not on any account to connect hisname with my public life._IV.--On the Road to Fame_The bitterness of my misery was brought home to me with new force when Isaw Bernardo at a gambling saloon in the company of a handsome woman ofdoubtful reputation. That Annunciata should have preferred this fickleman to me My debut at San Carlo aroused great enthusiasm and Santawhom I saw next day in her snug heavily curtained room seemed radiantwith happiness at my success. She made me sit on a soft silken sofastroked my head and spoke of my future. I kissed her hand and lookedinto her dark eyes with a purity of soul and thought. She was greatlyexcited. I saw her bosom heave violently she loosened a scarf tobreathe more freely. "You are deserving of love" said she. "Soul andbeauty are deserving of any woman's love" She drew me towards her herlips were like fire that flowed into my very soulEternal Mother of God The holy image at that moment fell down fromthe wall. It was no mere accident. "No no" I exclaimed starting up."Antonio" cried she "kill me kill me but do not leave me" But Irushed out of the house determined never to set eyes upon Santa again.The sea air would cool me. I took a boat to Torre del Annunciata andhappiness gradually returned to me as I realised what danger I hadescaped by the grace of the Virgin.I joined the crowd watching the fiery stream of lava slowly descendingtowards the sea when I heard somebody calling my name. It was Fabianiwho insisted on taking me at once to see Francesca. The welcome washearty. There were no recriminations although I resented for a whilethe tone of benevolent patronage adopted by my benefactors. I learntthat Bernardo had entered the King of Naples' service and thatAnnunciata was shortly expected. An expedition was arranged to Pstumand Capri and Fabiani insisted upon my joining the party. He alsoundertook to write to his father-in-law on my behalf....At Pstum we found the abundance and luxuriance of Sicilian landscapeits Grecian temples and its poverty. We were surrounded by crowds ofhalf-naked beggars. One young girl there was a little away from theothers scarcely more than eleven years old but lovely as the goddessof beauty. Modesty soul and a deep expression of suffering wereexpressed in her countenance. She was blind I gave her a scudo. Hercheeks burned. She kissed my hand and the touch seemed to go through myblood. The guide told us afterwards that her name was Lara and that shegenerally sat in the Temple of Neptune.The ruined temple made a mighty impression upon us I was requested toimprovise in these romantic surroundings. Deeply moved by my thoughts ofthe blind girl I sang of the glories of Nature and art and of the poormaiden from whom all this magnificence was concealed. When we left the
comment24,temple I lagged behind and looking around I saw Lara on her kneesher hands clasped together. She had heard my song It smote me to thesoul. I saw her pressing my scudo to her lips and smile I grew quitewarm at the sight of it and pressed a hot kiss upon her forehead. Witha thrilling cry she sprang up like a terrified deer and was gone. Ifelt as if I had committed a sin and sadly joined my party.Amalfi Capri--I drank the intoxicating beauty of it all. Then I wasprevailed upon to return to Rome with Fabiani and Francesca. We spent aday at Naples where I found two letters waiting for me. The first was abrief note to this effect "A faithful heart which intends honourablyand kindly towards you expects you this evening." It gave an addressbut no name--merely "Your old friend." The second was from the samehand and read "Come Antonio The terror of the last unfortunatemoment of our parting is now well over. Come quickly Delay not a momentin coming" The letters were obviously from Santa.My mind was made up not to see her again. We left for Rome....The Palazzo Borghese was now my home. Eccellenza received me with thegreatest kindness but all the family continued to use the old teachingtone and depreciating mode of treatment. Thus six years went by butsomehow my protectors did not realise that I was no longer a boy and mydependence gave them the right to make them let me feel the bitternessof my position. Even my talent as poet and improvisatore was by no meanstaken seriously at the palace.Happiness was brought into my life once more by Flaminia "the littleabbess" who came home to have her last glimpse of the world beforetaking the veil. She had grown tall and pale of complexion with anexpression of wonderful gentleness in her features. She recalled ourearly friendship when she used to sit on my knee and make me drawpictures for her and tell her stories. From her at any rate I sufferedno humiliation and from day to day our friendship grew closer. I toldher about Bernardo and Annunciata and about Lara who becameinexpressibly dear to her. I also endeavoured to make her reconsider herdecision to take the veil and immure herself for life but her wholeeducation and inclination tended towards that goal. At last the dayitself came--a day of great solemnity and state. Flaminia was dead andburied--and Elizabeth the nun the bride of Heaven arose from the bier_V.--The Sorrowful Wayfarer_In my sadness of heart I thought of my childhood and old Domenica whomI had not seen for many months. I went out to the Campagna. Domenica haddied six months back When I returned I was seized by a violent feverfrom which I recovered but slowly. It was six months after Flaminia hadtaken the veil that the doctor allowed me to go out.My first walk was to the grey convent where she now passed hermonotonous days. Every evening I returned and often I stood gazing ather prison and thinking of Flaminia as I used to know her. One eveningFabiani found me thus and made me follow him home. He spoke to me withunusual solemnity in his voice but with great kindness. I was ill.Travelling change of scene would do me good. I was to move about for ayear and then return to show what the world had made of me.I went to Venice. Dreary sad and quiet seemed to me the Queen of theAdriatic. In the gently swaying gondola I thought with bitterness ofAnnunciata. I felt a grudge even against innocent pious Flaminia whopreferred the convent to my strong brotherly love. Then my thoughtsfloated between Lara the image of beauty and Santa the daughter ofsin.One day I took a boat to the Lido to breathe the fresh air of the sea.On the beach I came across Poggio a young Venetian nobleman with whom Ihad made friends and as a storm hung threatening in the sky I decidedto accept his invitation for dinner. We watched the fury of the stormfrom the window and then joined a crowd of women and children anxiouslywatching a fishing boat out at sea. Before our very eyes the boat wasswallowed by the waves and with aching hearts we witnessed the prayers
comment25,shrieks and despair of the anxious watchers whose husbands and fathersperished thus within their sight.Next evening there was a reception at my banker's. The storm became atopic of conversation and Poggio related the death of the fishermentrying to enlist sympathy for the poor survivors. But nobody seemed tounderstand his intention. Then I was asked to improvise. I was quicklydetermined. "I know of an emotion" I exclaimed "which awakens supremehappiness in everybody and I have the power of exciting it in everyheart. But this art cannot be given it must be purchased. He who givesmost will be most deeply initiated." Money and jewels were quicklyforthcoming and I began to sing of the proud sea and the bold marinersand fishermen. I described what I had seen and my art succeeded wherePoggio's words had failed. A tumult of applause arose. A young lady sankat my feet seized my hand and with her beautiful tear-filled eyesgave me a look of intense gratitude which agitated me in strangefashion. Then she withdrew as if in horror at what she had done.Poggio afterwards told me that she was the queen of beauty in Venicethe podest's niece adored by everybody but known by few since thepodest's house was most exclusive and received but few guests. Heaccounted me the luckiest of mortals when he heard that I had receivedan invitation from the podest and would have a chance of improving myacquaintance with Maria his beautiful niece. I was received as if I hadbeen a beloved relative. Something in Maria's expression recalled to methe blind beggar-girl Lara but Maria had eyes with a singularly darkglance of fire. I became a daily visitor at the podest's house andspent many happy hours in Maria's company. Her intellect and charm ofcharacter captivated me as much as her beauty._VI.--A Marriage in Venice_One evening I strayed into a wretched little theatre where one ofMercadante's operas was being performed. How can I describe my feelingswhen in one of the singers--a slight ordinary figure with a thinsharp countenance and deeply sunken eyes in a poor dress and with apoorer voice but still with surprising grace of manner--I recognised
comment26,Annunciata With aching heart I left the theatre and ascertainedAnnunciata's address. She lived in a miserable garret. She turneddeathly pale when she recognised me and implored me to leave her. "Icome as a friend as a brother" I said. "You have been illAnnunciata" Then she told me of her illness four years back whichrobbed her of her youth her voice her money her friends. She imploredme with a pitiful voice to leave her. I could not speak. I pressed herhand to my lips stammered "I come--I come again" and left her.Next day I called again and found Annunciata had left no one knewwhither.It was a month later that Maria handed me a letter which had been givento her for me by a dying person who had sent for her. The letter wasfrom Annunciata who was no more. It told me of her happiness at havingseen me once more--told me that she had always loved me that her painat having to part from me had made her conceal her face on what she thenbelieved to be Bernardo's dead body told me that it was she who hadsent me those two letters in Naples who had believed my love was deadsince I left for Rome without sending her a reply. It told me of herillness her years of poverty and her undying love. And then she wishedme happiness with as she had been told the most beautiful and thenoblest maid in Venice for my bride ...In travel I sought forgetfulness and consolation. I went to PaduaVerona Milan but heaviness did not leave my heart. Then came anirrepressible longing to be back in Venice to see Maria--a forebodingof some new misfortune. I hastened back to Venice. The podest receivedme kindly but when I inquired after Maria he seemed to me to becomegrave as he told me she had gone to Padua on a short visit. Duringsupper I fell into a swoon followed by a violent fever in which I hadvisions of Maria dead laid out before an altar. Then it was Lara I sawon the bier and I loudly called her by name. Then everything becamebright a hand passed softly over my head. I awoke and found Maria andher aunt by my bedside."Lara Maria hear me" I cried. "It is no dream. You have heard myvoice at Pstum. You know it again I feel it. I love you I have always
comment27,loved you""I have loved you too" she said kneeling by my side and seizing myhand. "I have loved you from the day when the sun burnt your kiss intomy forehead--loved you with the intuition of the blind"I then learnt that Maria--my Lara--had been cured of her blindness by agreat specialist in Naples the podest's brother who touched by herbeauty and purity had her educated and adopted her as his own child.On his death his sister took her to Venice where she found a new homein the podest's palace.                                   APULEIUSThe Golden Ass     Apuleius was born about 125 A.D. at Madaura in Africa.     After studying at Athens he practised as an advocate at Rome     and then wandered about Northern Africa lecturing on     philosophy and rhetoric. At Tripoli he was charged with having     won by witchcraft the love of a rich widow who had left him     her wealth. But he was acquitted after delivering an     interesting defence included among his extant works. He then     settled in Carthage where he died at an advanced age. Poor     Apuleius His good fame was darkened by the success of an     amusing romance "The Golden Ass" which he wrote by way of     recreation at Rome. He related the story of the adventures     which befell a young Greek nobleman who by an extreme     curiosity in regard to witchcraft got changed into a donkey.     It was an age of wild superstition and foolish credulity and     his readers confused the author of "The Golden Ass" with the     hero of it. Apuleius was credited with a series of impossible     exploits which he had not even invented. For his work is     merely a Latin adaptation of a lost Greek romance by Lucius of     Patras. But Apuleius deserves our gratitude for preserving a     unique specimen of the lighter literature of the ancient     Greeks together with the beautiful folk-tale of Cupid and     Psyche._I.--Lucius Sets Out on His Wonderful Adventures_I set out from Corinth in a fever of excitement and expectation ridingmy horse so hard that it fell lame so I had to do the remainder of thejourney on foot. My heart was filled with joy and terror as I enteredthe town of Hypata."Here I am at last" I cried "in Thessaly Thessaly the land of magicand witchcraft famous through the world for its marvels andenchantments"Carried away by my desire after strange and mystic knowledge I gazedaround with wonder and disquietude. Nothing in this marvellous city Ithought to myself is really what it seems to be. The stones I stumbledover appeared to be living creatures petrified by magic. I fancied thatthe trees in the gardens and the birds that sang in their branches weremen that had been transformed by Thessalian witches. The very statuesseemed as if they were about to walk every wall had ears and I lookedup into the blue cloudless sky expecting to hear oracles.Entering the market place I passed close to a noble lady who waswalking with a crowd of servants in her train."By Hercules" she cried. "It's Lucius" I hung back confused andblushing and Byrrhena for it was she said to one of her companions"It's Salvia's boy Isn't he the image of his modest beautiful motherYoung tall and fair with just her bright grey-blue eyes and heralert glance. A Plutarch every bit of him Lucius don't you rememberyour kinswoman Byrrhena Why I brought you up with my own hands"I remembered Byrrhena very well and loved her. But I did not want tomeet her just then. However I went with her to her house a beautifulbuilding of fine marble containing some exquisite statuary."You will stay here my dear Lucius won't you" she said.I then told her that I had come to Hypata to see Milo and his wifePamphila. My friend Demeas of Corinth had given me a letter ofintroduction."Don't you know that Pamphila is a witch" she cried. "Do not go nearher my child or she will practise her wicked arts on you. It is justhandsome young men like you that she enchants and destroys."
comment28,Far from being terrified by Byrrhena's warning I was delighted with it.I longed to become an apprentice to a witch as powerful as Pamphila.With a hasty excuse I left the house and set out to find Milo. Neitherhe nor Pamphila was in when I called. But their maid who opened thedoor was such a pretty wench that I did not regret their absence.Fotis as she was called was a graceful sprightly little thing withthe loveliest hair I ever saw. I liked the way it fell in soft puffs onher neck and rested on her neat linen tunic.It was a case of love at first sight with both of us. But before I beganto ask her about Pamphila Milo returned. He welcomed me very warmlyand put the best room in his house at my disposal and desired me tostay to dinner. But in spite of my ardent curiosity I was I mustconfess rather afraid of meeting his wife. So I said that my kinswomanByrrhena had already engaged me to dine with her.On arriving at Byrrhena's mansion I was surprised to find that asplendid banquet had been prepared and that all the best people inHypata were present. We reclined on couches of ivory covered withgolden drapery and a throng of lovely girls served us with exquisitedishes while pretty curly-headed boys brought the wine round in gobletsof gold and amber.When the lights were brought in the talk became freer and gayereverybody was bent on laughing and making his neighbours laugh."We are you see preparing for the great festival to-morrow" Byrrhenasaid to me. "Hypata is the only city that keeps the feast of the god oflaughter. You must come and invent some pleasantry to propitiate themerriest of all deities.""By Hercules" I replied. "If the laughing god will only lend meinspiration to-night I will do my best to entertain the townspeopleto-morrow."_II.--The Feast of the God of Laughter_It was the jolliest banquet I was ever at. Even in Corinth we did not dothe thing so well. It was not until I got into the open air and set outfor Milo's house that I knew how much wine I had taken. But though Iwas rather unsteady on my feet I retained my presence of mind. Ireached the house and suddenly three great burly fellows sprang up andbattered furiously at the door. They were clearly robbers of the mostdesperate type and I drew my sword and as they came at me one by oneI plunged it swiftly into their bodies. Fotis was aroused and openedthe door and I entered utterly worn out by the struggle and went atonce to bed and to sleep.Early in the morning I was awakened by a great clamour. A throng ofpeople burst into my bedroom and two lictors arrested me and dragged
comment29,me to the forum. But as they took me through the streets and squareseverybody turned out to see me and the crowd grew so great that theforum was not large enough to hold the people and I was led to thetheatre.There the lictors pushed me down through the proscenium as though Iwere a victim for sacrifice and put me in the centre of the orchestra."Citizens" said the prefect of the watch "as I was going on my roundslate last night I saw this ferocious young foreigner sword in handslashing and stabbing three inoffensive creatures. When I arrived theywere lying dead upon the ground. Their murderer overwhelmed by histerrible crime fled into a house and hid there hoping no doubt toescape in the morning. Men of Hypata you do not allow your ownfellow-townsmen to commit murder with impunity. Shall then thissavage brutal alien avoid the consequences of his fearful crime"For some time I could not reply. The suddenness of the whole thingterrified me and it was with a voice broken with sobs that I at lastmanaged to make my defence."They were robbers" I cried "robbers of the most desperate and vilestcharacter I caught them breaking into the house of my friend Milo youresteemed fellowtownsman oh citizens of Hypata There were three ofthem--three great rough burly rascals each more than a match for amere boy like myself. Yet I managed to kill them and I think I deservepraise at your hands and not censure for my public-spirited action."Here I stopped for I saw that all the vast multitude of people waslaughing at me. And what grieved me most was to see my kinswomanByrrhena and my host Milo among my mockers. The senior magistrateordered the wheel and other instruments of torture to be brought forth."I cannot believe a mere boy like this could have slain three greatstrong men single-handed" he said. "He must have had accomplices andwe must torture him until he reveals the names of his partners in thismost dastardly crime. But first of all let him look upon the bodies ofthe men he has foully murdered. Perhaps that will melt his hard savagenature."The lictors then led me to the bier and forced me to uncover thebodies. Ye gods The corpses were merely three inflated wine-skins andI observed that they were cut in the very spots in which I thought I hadwounded the robbers. I had indeed invented a pleasantry for thefestival of the god of laughter The townspeople laughed with theinextinguishable laughter of the Olympian deities. They climbed up tothe roof to get a good look at me they swarmed up the pillars they
comment30,clung to the statues they hung from the windows at the risk of theirlives all shouting at me in wild jollity."Sir Lucius" the magistrate then said to me "we are not ignorant ofyour dignity and your rank. The noble family to which you belong isfamous throughout Greece. So do not take this pleasantry in honour ofthe joyful god of laughter as an insult. In return for your excellentservices at this great festival the city of Hypata has decreed thatyour statue shall be cast in bronze and erected in a place of honour."By this time I had recovered somewhat of my good humour. But knowing howmercilessly I should be teased at the banquet Byrrhena wished to give incelebration of my exploits I went quickly home with Milo and aftersupping with him retired at a very early hour to my bed-chamber._III.--Lucius Becomes an Ass_In the middle of the night I heard a knock at my door. I opened it andin came pretty Fotis looking a picture of misery."I can't sleep without telling you everything" she said. "I was thecause of all the trouble that befell you to-day. As my mistress wascoming from the baths yesterday she saw a handsome young gentlemanhaving his hair cut by a barber. Seized with a wild passion for him sheordered me to get some of his hair. But the barber saw me and drove meaway. I knew I should get a cruel whipping if I returned empty-handed.Close by was a man shaving some wine-bags of goat-skin the hair wassoft and yellow like the young gentleman's so I took some of it toPamphila. You know my mistress is a terrible witch so you can guesswhat happened. She rose up in the night and burnt the hair in her magiccauldron. As it burnt the wine-bags from which it was taken felt thecompulsion of the spell. They became like human beings. Rushing out intothe street they hurled themselves against the door of our house asPamphila expected the young gentleman would do. You came up--just alittle intoxicated eh--and committed the horrible crime ofbag-slaughter.""Now don't make fun of me Fotis" I said. "This is a serious matterthis witchcraft. What is Pamphila doing to-night I have come here tolearn magic and I am very anxious to see her practising her strangearts.""Come then and look" said Fotis.We crept to the room where Pamphila was and peeped through a chink inthe door. The witch undressed herself and then took some boxes ofointment out of a casket and opened one box and smeared herself withthe stuff it contained. In the twinkling of an eye feathers sproutedout of her skin and she changed into an owl and flew out of thewindow."She has gone after that handsome young gentleman" said Fotis. "I haveto wait here all night until she returns and then give her a lotion ofaniseed and laurel-leaves to restore her to her proper shape.""Why my dear Fotis" I exclaimed in intense admiration "you know asmuch about witchcraft as your mistress Come practise on me Get mesome of that ointment and change me into a bird. Oh how I should like
comment31,to fly"After some hesitation she entered the room and took a box out of thecasket. I stripped myself and smeared the ointment over my body. Butnever a feather appeared Every hair on me changed into a bristle myhands turned into hoofed forefeet a tail grew out of my backbone myface lengthened and I found to my horror that I had become an ass."Oh ye gods" said Fotis "I've taken the wrong box But no greatharm's done dear Lucius. I know the antidote. I'll get you some rosesto crunch and you will be restored to your proper shape."Fotis however dared not go at once into the garden lest Pamphilashould suddenly return and find me. So she told me to go and wait in thestable until daybreak and then she would gather some roses for me. Butwhen I got into the stable I wished I had waited outside. My own horseand an ass belonging to Milo conceived a strange dislike to me. Theyfell upon me with great fury and bit me and kicked me and made such aclamour that the groom came to see whatever was the matter. He found mestanding on my hind legs trying to reach the garland of roses which hehad placed on the shrine of the goddess Epona in the middle of thestable."What a sacrilegious brute" he cried falling upon me savagely."Attacking the shrine of the divinity who guards over horses I'll lameyou that I will"As he was belabouring me with a great cudgel a band of fierce men armedwith swords and carrying lighted torches appeared. At the sight of themthe groom fled in terror."Help Help Robbers" I heard Milo and Fotis cry.But before the groom was able to fetch the watch the robbers forcedtheir way into the house and broke open Milo's strongbox. Then theyloaded me and the horse and the ass with the stolen wealth and drove usout into the mountains. Unused to the heavy burden laid on me I wentrather slowly. This enraged the robbers and they beat me until I waswell-nigh dead. But at last I saw a sight which filled me with thewildest joy. We passed a noble country house surrounded by a garden ofsweet-smelling roses. I rushed open-mouthed upon the flowers. But justas I strained my curling lips towards them I stopped. If I changedmyself into a man the robbers would kill me either as a wizard or outof fear that I would inform against them So I left the roses untouchedand in the evening we came to the cave in the mountains where therobbers dwelt and there to my delight I was relieved of my grievousload.Soon afterwards another band of robbers arrived carrying a young andlovely maid arrayed as a bride. Her beautiful features were pale andwet with tears and she tore her hair and her garments. "Take thisgirl" said the robbers to the old woman who waited upon them "andcomfort her. Tell her she's in no danger. Her people are rich and willsoon ransom her."Charite for such was the name of the beautiful bride fell weeping intoone of the old women's arms."They tore me away from Tlepolemus" she said "when he was about toenter my bridal chamber. Our house was decked with laurel and thebridal-song was being sung when a band of swordsmen entered with drawnswords and carried me off. Now I shall never see my bridegroom again.""Yes you will dearie" said the old woman. "But don't let us talkabout it now. After all you are not in so evil a plight as Psyche waswhen she lost her husband Cupid. Now listen while I tell you thatmarvellous tale."And here is the tale of Cupid and Psyche as the old woman related it toCharite_IV.--The Marvellous Story of Cupid and Psyche_"There was once a king of a certain city who had three daughters. All of
comment32,them were very beautiful but Psyche the youngest was lovelier eventhan Venus. The people worshipped her as she walked the streets andstrewed her path with flowers. Strangers from all parts of the worldthronged to see her and to adore her. The temples of Venus weredeserted and no garlands were laid at her shrines. Thereupon thegoddess of love and beauty grew angry. She tossed her head with a cry ofrage and called to her son Cupid and showed him Psyche walking thestreets of the city."'Avenge me' she said. 'Fill this maiden with burning love for theugliest wretchedest creature that lives on earth.'"The king was thereupon commanded by an oracle to array his daughter inbridal robes and set her upon a high mountain so that she might bewedded to a horrible monster. All the city was filled with grief andlamentation when Psyche was led out to her doom and placed upon thelonely peak. Then a mighty wind arose and carried the maiden to anenchanted palace where she was waited on by unseen spirits who playedsweet music for her delight and fed her with delicious food. But in thedarkness of night someone came to her couch and wooed her tenderly andshe fell in love with him and became his wife. And he said 'Psyche youmay do what you will in the palace I have built for you. But one thingyou must not do--you must not attempt to see my face.'"Her husband was very sweet and kind but he came only in the nighttime and in the daytime Psyche felt very lonesome. So she begged herhusband to let her sisters come and stay with her and her husband hadthem brought on a mighty wind. When they saw how delightfully Psychelived in the enchanted palace they grew jealous of her strangehappiness."'Yes this is a very pleasant place' they exclaimed 'but you knowwhat the oracle said Psyche. You are married to a monster That is thereason why he will not let you see his face.'"In the night when they had departed Psyche lighted a lamp and lookedat her bedfellow. Oh joy It was Cupid the radiant young god of lovereposing in his beauty. In her excitement Psyche let a drop of burningoil fall from the lamp upon his right shoulder. The god leaped up andspread out his wings and flew away saying"'Instead of marrying you to a monster in obedience to my mother'scommands I wedded you myself. And this is how you serve me FarewellPsyche Farewell'"But Psyche set out to follow him and after a long and toilsome journeyshe reached the court of Venus where Cupid was now imprisoned. Venusseized her and beat her and then set her on dangerous tasks and triedto bring about her death. But Psyche was so lovely and gentle that everyliving creature wished to help her and save her. Then Venus fearingthat Cupid would escape and rescue his wife said"'Psyche take this casket to Proserpine in the Kingdom of the Deadand ask her to fill it with beauty.'"Psyche was in despair. No mortal had ever returned from the Kingdom ofthe Dead. She climbed a high tower and prepared to throw herself downand die. But the very stones took pity upon her."'Go to Tnarus' they said 'and there you will find a way to theUnderworld. Take two copper coins in your mouth and two honey-cakes inyour hands.'"Psyche travelled to Tnarus near Lacedmon and there she found a holeleading to the Underworld. A ghostly ferryman rowed her over the Riverof Death and took one of her copper coins. Then a monstrous dog withthree heads sprang out but Psyche fed him with one of her honey-cakesand entered the hall of Proserpine the queen of the dead. Proserpinefilled the casket and by means of the last honey-cake and the lastcopper coin Psyche returned to the green bright earth."But alas she was over-curious and opened the casket to see thedivine beauty it contained. A deadly vapour came out and overpoweredher and she fell to the ground. But Cupid who had now escaped from hisprison found her lying on the grass and wiped the vapour from herface. Taking her in his arms he spread out his wings and carried herto Olympus and there they live together in unending bliss with theirlittle child whose name is Joy."_V.--The Further Strange Adventures of the Ass_
comment33,While the old woman was entertaining the beautiful captive with thischarming tale a tall fierce young man in ragged clothes stalked boldlyin among the robbers."Long life to you brave comrades" he said. "Don't judge me by theserags my boys. They're a disguise. Have you heard of Hmus the famousThracian brigand If so you've heard of me. My band has been cut upbut I'm bringing what men I still have to you. Shall we join forces"The robbers had just lost their own captain so they received Hmus withgreat joy and made him their leader. Soon afterwards ten of his mencame in loaded with swollen wine-bags."Here's enough wine" he said "to last us a fortnight if we use ittemperately. Let us celebrate this glorious day by finishing it at onesitting"The robbers at once fell furiously to drinking and their new captainforced Charite to come and sit beside him. After a little wooing shebegan to cling to him and return his kisses."Oh what a frail fickle faithless race are women" I said to myself."Scarcely two hours ago she was crying her eyes out for her bridegroomnow here she is fondling a wretched assassin."What an ass I was It was some time before I noticed that the newcaptain did not drink himself and that the men he brought with him wereonly pretending to drink while forcing the wine on the other robberswho soon became too drunk to drink and rolled over in a deep sleep."Up boys and disarm and bind these ruffians" said the new captainwho was none other than Tlepolemus the bridegroom of the fair Charite.And leaving his servants to perform this task he put Charite on myback and led me to his native town. All the inhabitants poured out intothe street to see us pass and they loudly acclaimed Tlepolemus for hisvalour and ingenuity in rescuing his lovely bride and capturing therobbers.Charite did not forget me in the scenes of rejoicing. She patted my headand kissed my rough face and bade the groom of the stud feed me welland let me have the run of the fields."Now I shall at last be able to get a mouthful of roses" I thought"and recover my human shape."But alas the groom was an avaricious disobedient slave and he atonce sold me to a troupe of those infamous beggarly priests of Cybelewho cart the Syrian goddess about the public squares to the sound ofcymbals and rattles.The next morning my new owners smeared their faces with rouge andpainted their eyes with black grease then they dressed themselves inwhite tunics and set their wretched goddess on my back and marchedout leaping and brandishing great swords and axes. On coming to themansion of a wealthy man they raised a wild din and whirled about andcut themselves and scourged themselves until they were covered withblood. The master of the mansion was so impressed with this savage and
comment34,degrading spectacle that he gave the priests a good sum of money andinvited them into his house. They took the goddess with them and Iscampered out into the fields searching for some roses.But I was quickly brought back by the cook. His master had given him afat haunch from an enormous stag to roast for the priests' dinner and adog had run off with it. In order to avoid being whipped for hiscarelessness the slave resolved to let the priests dine off a haunch oftheir own ass. He locked the door of the kitchen so that I could notescape and then took a long knife and came to kill me. But I had nomind to perish in this way and I dashed upstairs into the room wherethe master was busy worshipping the goddess in the company of thepriests and knocked the table over and the goddess and many of theworshippers."Kill the wretched thing" said the master. "It has gone mad."But the priests did not care to lose their salable property and theylocked me in their bedroom and sold me to the first man they met thenext morning. It was a poor gardener who needed an ass to cart his stuffto market. But as the gardener was taking me home a soldier cametramping along the road. He too wanted an ass to carry his heavy kit.So he struck the gardener down with his sword and seized me by right ofconquest then loading me with his armour and shield and baggage hetook me to the town to which he was travelling. There he was ordered byhis tribune to take some letters to Rome so he disposed of me for asmall sum to two confectioners.By this time I had grown very feeble and thin. Though I was changed intoan ass L could not relish hay and grass and food of that sort and Iderived scarcely any nourishment from it. I still had human tastes aswell as human thoughts and feelings. Happily I was very well off withmy new masters. Every evening they brought home the remains of thebanquets they had served--bits of chicken pork fish and meat andvarious cakes and these they put in their room while they went for abath before dinner. I used then to creep in and take all the best bitsand when my two masters returned they began to reproach each other withhaving filched the choicest pieces. In the meantime I grew plump andglossy and broad-backed and as my masters observed I ate no hay theyspied on me one evening.They forgot their quarrel when they saw their ass picking out the bestbits with the taste of an epicure and bursting open the door theycried "Let us try him with wine" Naturally I drank it very readily."We have got a treasure here" they said. They soon found that I wasintelligent and understood human language. And after training me theytook me to Corinth and exhibited me there and made a great deal ofmoney. In a short time I became famous throughout Greece as the "GoldenAss" and I was bought by the town for use in the public show. Nobody
comment35,thought that any watch need be kept over an animal as thoroughlycivilised as I was and one evening I succeeded in escaping and fled toa lonely spot on the seashore._VI.--The Miracle of Isis and the Fate of Lucius_As I nestled down on the soft sand the full-orbed moon rose above theeastern waves and shone with a glorious radiance. My heart opened tothe mysteries of the sacred night and I sprang up and bathed seventimes in the cleansing water of the sea. Then with tears upon mycheeks I prayed to Isis the mighty saviour goddess"O Queen of Heaven who dost enlighten the world with thy lovely beamsas thou goest on thy lonely way hear me now and help me in my periland misery and misfortune Restore me O mighty goddess to my rightfulshape and let Lucius return to the bosom of his family."Sleep fell swiftly upon my eyes and in my sleep the goddess visited me.She rose up a vision of light from the waters. On her head was a crownof radiant flowers shaped like the moon and serpents coiled about hertemples and her divine body was arrayed in a robe of shining darknessembroidered with innumerable stars."See Lucius" she said with a voice that breathed a great sweetnessover me "Isis appears in answer to your prayer. Cease now to weep andmourn for I am come in pity of your lot to show favour to you.To-morrow my priest will descend to the seashore to celebrate myfestival and in his left hand he will carry a crown of roses. Go forthwithout fear and take the crown of roses and then put off the shape ofa beast and put on the form of a man. Serve me well all the days ofyour life and when you go down to the grave you shall see me as a lightamid the darkness--as a queen in the palace of hell. By my favour youshall be lifted up into the fields of Paradise and there you shallworship and adore me for all eternity."The saviour goddess then vanished and I awoke and the dawn was in thesky and the waves of the sea were dancing in the golden light. A longprocession was winding down from the city to the shore to the sound offlutes and pipes.First came a great multitude of people carrying lamps and torches and
comment36,tapers in honour of the constellations of heaven then a choir ofsweet-voiced boys and girls in snowy garments and next a train of menand women luminous in robes of pure white linen these were theinitiates and they were followed by the prelates of the sacredmysteries and behind them all walked the high priest bearing in hisright hand the mystic rattle of Isis and in his left hand the crown ofroses. By divine intervention the crowd parted and made a way for meand when I came to the priest he held out the roses and I ate them andwas changed into a man. The people raised their hands to heavenwonder-stricken by the miracle and the fame of it went out over all theworld. The priest initiated me into the mysteries of Isis and Osirisand I shaved my head and entered the College of Pastors and became aservant of the high gods.                                     The Arabian NightsOr The Thousand and One Nights     There is as much doubt about the history of "The Thousand and     One Nights" as that which veils the origin of the Homeric     poems. It is said that a certain Caliph Shahryar having been     deceived by his wife slew her and afterwards married a wife     only for one day slaying her on the morning after. When this     slaughter of women had continued some time he became wedded to     one Shahrazad daughter of his Vizir who by telling the     Commander of the Faithful exciting stories and leaving them     unfinished every dawn so provoked the Caliph's curiosity that     he kept her alive and at last grew so fond of her that he had     no thought of putting her to death. As for the authorship of     the stories they are certainly not the work of one mind and     have probably grown with the ages into their present form. The     editions published for Christian countries do not represent     the true character of these legends which are often     exceedingly sensual. The European versions of this     extraordinary entertainment began in 1704 with the work of one     Antoine Galland Professor of Arabic at the College of France     a Frenchman who according to Sir Richard Burton possessed     "in a high degree that art of telling a tale which is far more     captivating than culture or scholarship." Sir R. Burton see     Vol. XIX summed up what may be definitely believed of the     Nights in the following conclusion The framework of the book     is purely Persian perfunctorily Arabised the archetype being     the Hazar Afsanah. The oldest tales may date from the reign of     Al-Mansur in the eighth century others belong to the tenth     century and the latest may be ascribed to the sixteenth. The     work assumed its present form in the thirteenth century. The     author is unknown "for the best reason there never was one."_I.--The Seven Voyages of Sindbad the Sailor_When the father of Sindbad was taken to Almighty Allah much wealth cameto the possession of his son but soon did it dwindle in booncompanionship for the city of Baghdad is sweet to the youthful. Thendid Sindbad bethink him how he might restore his fortune saying tohimself "Three things are better than other three the day of death isbetter than the day of birth a live dog is better than a dead lion andthe grave is better than want" and gathering merchandise together hetook ship and sailed away to foreign countries.Now it came to pass that the captain of this ship sighted a strangeisland whereon were grass and trees very pleasant to the eyes. So theyanchored and many went ashore. When these had gathered fruits theymade a fire and were about to warm themselves when the captain criedout from the ship "Ho there passengers run for your lives and hastenback to the ship and leave your gear and save yourselves fromdestruction. Allah preserve you For this island whereon ye stand is notrue island but a great fish stationary a-middlemost of the seawhereon the sand hath settled and trees have sprung up of old time so
comment37,that it is become like unto an island but when ye lighted fires on itit felt the heat and moved and in a moment it will sink with you intothe depths of the sea and ye will be drowned."When the fish moved the captain did not wait for his passengers butsailed away and Sindbad seizing a tub floated helpless in the greatwaters. But by the mercy of Allah he was thrown upon a true islandwhere a beautiful mare lay upon the ground who cried at his approach.Then a man started up at the mare's cry and seeing Sindbad bore him toan underground chamber where he regaled the waif with plenteous food.To him did this man explain how he was a groom of King Mirjan and thathe brought the king's mares to pasture on the island hiding undergroundwhile the stallions of the sea came up out of the waves unto the mares.Presently Sindbad saw this strange sight and witnessed how the groomdrove the stallions back to the waves when they would have dragged themares with them. After that he was carried before King Mirjan whoentreated him kindly and when he had amassed wealth returned by shipto Bussorah and so to Baghdad.But becoming possessed with the thought of travelling about the ways ofmen he set out on a second voyage. And it came to pass that he landedwith others on a lovely island and lay down to sleep after he hadeaten many delicious fruits. Awaking he found the ship gone. Thenpraying to Almighty Allah like a man distracted he roamed about theisland presently climbing a tree to see what he could see. And he saw agreat dome afar and journeyed to it.There was no entrance to this white dome and as he went round about itthe sun became suddenly darkened so that he looked towards it in fearand lo a bird in the heavens whose wings blackened all light. Then didSindbad know that the dome was an egg and that the bird was the birdroc which feeds its young upon elephants. Sore afraid he hid himselfand the bird settled upon the egg and brooded upon it. Then Sindbadunwound his turban and tying one end to the leg of the great bird andthe other about his own middle waited for the dawn.When the dawn was come the bird flew into the heavens unaware of theweight at its foot and Sindbad was borne across great seas and farcountries. When at last the bird settled on land Sindbad unfastened histurban and was free.But the place was filled with frightful serpents and strewn withdiamonds. Sindbad saw a dead sheep on the ground with diamonds stickingto its carcase and he knew that this was a device of merchants foreagles come and carry away these carcases to places beyond the reach ofthe serpents and merchants take the diamonds sticking to the flesh. Sohe hid himself under the carcase and an eagle bore him with it toinhabited lands and he was delivered.Again it came to him to travel and on this his third voyage the shipwas driven to the mountain of Zughb inhabited by hairy apes. These apesseized all the goods and gear breaking the ship but spared the men.Then they perceived a great house and entered it but nobody was there.At nightfall however a frightful giant entered and began to feel themen one by one till he found the fattest and him the giant roastedover a fire and ate like a chicken. This happened many days tillSindbad encouraged his friends and they heated two iron spits in thefire and while the giant slept put out his eyes. While they ran to theshore where they had built a raft the giant bellowing with ragereturned with two ghuls and pelted the raft with rocks killing somebut the rest escaped. However three only were alive when they reachedland.The shore on which these three landed was occupied by an immenseserpent like a dragon who instantly ate one of the three whileSindbad and the other climbed up a tree. Next day the serpent glided upthe tree and ate the second. Then Sindbad descended and with planksbound himself all round so that he was a man surrounded by a fence. Thusdid he abide safe from the serpent till a ship saved him.Now on his fourth voyage Sindbad's ship was wrecked and he fell among
comment38,hairy men cannibals who fattened all that they caught like cattle andconsumed them. He being thin and wasted by all his misfortunes escapeddeath and saw all his comrades fattened and roasted till they wentmad with cries of anguish. It chanced that the shepherd who tendedthese men in the folds took pity on Sindbad and showed him the road outof danger which taking he arrived after divers adventures anddifficulties at the country of a great king. In this country all werehorsemen but the saddle was unknown so Sindbad made first the kingand afterwards the vizir both saddle and stirrups which so delightedthem that he was advanced to great fortune and honour.Then was he married to a maiden most beautiful and chaste so lovely tobehold that she ravished the senses and he lived like one in a dream.But it came to pass that she died and when they buried her they tookSindbad and shut him in the Place of the Dead with her giving him alittle food and water till he should die. Such was the custom thathusband and wife should accompany the dead wife or husband in the Placeof the Dead--a mighty cave strewn with dead bodies dark as night andlittered with jewels.While Sindbad bewailed his lot in this place the doors opened a deadbody of a man was brought in and with it his live wife to whom foodwas given. Then Sindbad killed this fair lady with the bone of a legtook her food and jewels and thus did he serve all the live peoplethrust into the cavern. One day he heard a strange sound far up thecavern and perceived in the distance a wild beast. Then he knew thatthere must be some entrance at that far end and journeying thitherfound a hole in the mountain which led to the sea. On the shore Sindbadpiled all his jewels returning every day to the cavern to gather moretill a ship came and bore him away.His fifth voyage was interrupted by rocs whose egg the sailors hadsmashed open to see the interior of what they took to be a dome. Thesebirds flew over the ship with rocks in their claws and let them fall onto the ship so that it was wrecked.Sindbad reached shore on a plank and wandering on this island perceivedan old man very sad seated by a river. The old man signalled toSindbad that he should carry him on his back to a certain point and
comment39,this Sindbad very willingly bent himself to do. But once upon his backthe legs over the shoulders and wound round about his flanks the oldman refused to get off and drove Sindbad hither and thither with mostcruel blows. At last Sindbad took a gourd hollowed it out filled itwith grape juice stopped the mouth and set it in the sun. Then did hedrink of this wine and get merry and forget his misery dancing with theold man on his neck. So the old man asked for the gourd and drank ofit and fell sleepy and dropped from Sindbad's neck and Sindbad slewhim.After that Sindbad amassed treasure by pelting apes with pebbles whothrew back at him cocoanuts which he sold for money.On his sixth voyage Sindbad was wrecked on the most frightful mountainwhich no ship could pass. The sight of all the useless wealth strewnupon this terrible place of wreck and death drove all the otherpassengers mad so that they died. But Sindbad finding a stream builta raft and drifted with it till almost dead he arrived among Indiansand Abyssinians. Here he was well treated grew rich and returned inprosperity to Baghdad.But once again did he travel and this time his vessel encountered inthe middle seas three vast fish-like islands which lashed out anddestroyed the ship eating most but Sindbad escaped. When he reachedland he found himself well cared for among kind people and he grew richin an old man's house who married him to his only daughter. One dayafter the old man's death and when he was as rich as any in that landlo all the men grew into the likeness of birds and Sindbad begged oneof them to take him on his back on the mysterious flight to which theywere now bent. After persuasion the man-bird agreed and Sindbad wascarried up into the firmament till he could hear the angels glorifyingGod in the heavenly dome. Carried away by ecstasy he shouted praise ofAllah into the holy place and instantly the bird fell to the groundfor they were evil and incapable of praising God. But Sindbad returnedto his wife and she told him how evil were those people and that herfather was not of them and induced him to carry her to his own land. So
comment40,he sold all his possessions took ship and came to Baghdad where helived in great splendour and honour and this was the seventh and lastvoyage of Sindbad the Sailor._II.--The Tale of the Three Apples_The Caliph Haroun al-Raschid walking by night in the city found afisherman lamenting that he had caught nothing for his wife andchildren. "Cast again" said the caliph "and I will give thee a hundredgold pieces for whatsoever cometh up." So the man cast his net andthere came up a box wherein was found a young damsel foully murdered.Now to this murder confessed two men a youth and an old man and thiswas the story of the youth.His wife fell ill and had a longing for apples so that he made thejourney to Bussorah and bought three apples from the caliph's gardener.But his wife would not eat them. One day as he sat in his shop passeda slave bearing one of the apples. The husband asked how he came by itwhereat replied the slave that his mistress gave it him saying that herwittol of a husband had journeyed to Bussorah for it. Then in rage theyoung man returned and slew his wife. Presently his little son camehome saying that he was afraid of his mother and when the fatherquestioned him replied the child that he had taken one of his mother'sthree apples to play with and that a slave had stolen it. Then did thehusband know his wife to be innocent and he told her father all andthey both mourned for her and both offered themselves to theexecutioner--the one that he was guilty the other to save his son-in-law whose guilt was innocence.From this story followed that of Noureddin and his son Bedreddin Hassanwhose marriage to the Lady of Beauty was brought about by a genie inspite of great difficulties. And it was after hearing this tale thatHaroun al-Raschid declared to his vizir "It behoves that these storiesbe written in letters of liquid gold."_III.--Hassan the Rope-Maker_Two men so it chanced disputing whether wealth could give happinesscame before the shop of a poor rope-maker. Said one of the men "I willgive this fellow two hundred pieces of gold and see what he does withit." Hassan amazed by this gift put the gold in his turban except tenpieces and went forth to buy hemp for his trade and meat for hischildren.As he journeyed a famished vulture made a pounce at the meat andHassan's turban fell off with which the vulture balked of the meatflew away far out of sight.When the two men returned they found Hassan very unhappy and the samewho had given before gave him another two hundred pieces which Hassanhid carefully all but ten pieces in a pot of bran. While he was outbuying hemp his wife exchanged the pot of bran for some scouring sandwith a sandman in the street. Hassan was maddened when he came home andbeat his wife and tore her hair and howled like an evil spirit. When
comment41,his friends returned they were amazed by his tale but the one who hadas yet given nothing now gave Hassan a lump of lead picked up in thestreet saying "Good luck shall come of homely lead where gold profitsnothing."Hassan thought but little of the lead and when a fisherman sent amonghis neighbours that night for a piece of lead wherewith to mend hisnets very willingly did Hassan part with this gift the fishermanpromising him the first fish he should catch.When Hassan's wife cut open this fish to cook it she found within it alarge piece of glass crystal clear which she threw to the children fora plaything. A Jewess who entered the shop saw this piece of glasspicked it up and offered a few pieces of money for it. Hassan's wifedared not do anything now without her husband's leave and Hassan beingsummoned refused all the offers of the Jewess perceiving that thepiece of glass was surely a precious diamond. At last the Jewess offereda hundred thousand pieces of gold and as this was wealth beyondwealth Hassan very willingly agreed to the barter._IV.--Prince Ahmed and the Fairy_Once upon a time there was a sultan who had three sons and all theseyoung men loved their cousin the fatherless and motherless Nouronniharwho lived at their father's court.To decide which should marry the princess the sultan bade them go fortheach a separate way and after a time determined to end their travelsby assembling at a certain place. "He of you who brings back from histravels the greatest of rarities" said the sultan "he shall marry theprincess my niece." To Almighty Allah was confided the rest.The eldest of the princes Houssain by name consorted with merchants inhis travels but saw nothing strange or wonderful till he encountered aman crying a piece of carpet for forty pieces of gold. "Such is themagic of this carpet" protested the man "that he who sits himself uponit is instantly transported to whatsoever place he desires to visit beit over wide seas or tall mountains." The prince bought this carpetamused himself with it for some time and then flew joyfully to theplace of assembly.Hither came the second prince Ali who brought from Persia an ivorytube down which if any man looked he beheld the sight that most hedesired to see and the third prince the young Ahmed who had boughtfor thirty-five pieces of gold a magic apple the smell of which wouldrestore a soul almost passed through the gate of death.The three princes desiring to see their beloved princess looked downAli's ivory tube and lo the tragic sight that met their gaze--for theprincess lay at the point of death.Swiftly did they seat themselves upon Houssain's magic carpet and in amoment of time found themselves beside the princess whom Ahmedinstantly restored to life and beauty and health by his magic apple.As it seemed impossible to decide which of these rare things was therarest the sultan commanded that each prince should shoot an arrow andhe whose arrow flew farthest should become the husband of Nouronnihar.Houssain drew the first bow then Ali whose arrow sped much fartherand then Ahmed whose arrow was not to be found.Houssain in despair gave up his right of succession to the throneand with a blighted heart went out into the wilderness to become aholy man. Ali was married to the princess and Ahmed went forth into theworld to seek his lost arrow.After long wandering Ahmed found his arrow among desolate rocks toofar for any man to have shot with the bow and while he looked abouthim amazed and dumfounded he beheld an iron door in the rocks whichyielded to his touch and led into a very sumptuous palace. Thereadvanced towards him a lady of surpassing loveliness who announced thatshe was a genie that she knew well who he was and had sent the carpetthe tube and the apple and had guided his arrow to her door.Furthermore she confessed to the prince great love for him and offeredhim all that she possessed leading him to a vast and magnificentchamber where a marriage-feast was prepared for them.Prince Ahmed was happy for some while and then he thought of his
comment42,father grieving for him and at last obtained leave from the beautifulgenie to go on a visit to his home. At first his father was glad to seehim but afterwards jealousy of his son and the son's secret place ofdwelling and suspicion that a son so rich and powerful might havedesigns on his throne led his father to lay hard and cruel burdens onPrince Ahmed.However all that he commanded Ahmed performed by help of the genieeven things the most impossible. He brought a tent which would cover thesultan's army and yet folded up lay in the hollow of a man's hand.This and many other wonderful things did Ahmed perform till the sultanasked for a man one foot and a half in height with a beard thirty feetlong who could carry a bar of iron weighing five hundredweight.Such a man the genie found and the sultan beholding him turned awayin disgust whereat the dwarf flew at him in a rage and with his ironbar smote him to death.Thus too did the little man treat all the wicked courtiers andsorcerers who had incensed the sultan against his son. And Ahmed and thegenie became sultan and sultana of all that world while Ali andNouronnihar reigned over a great province bestowed upon them by PrinceAhmed.As for Houssain he forsook not the life of a holy man living in thewilderness._V.--The Hunchback_There lived long ago a poor tailor with a pretty wife to whom he wastenderly attached. One day there came to his door a hunchback whoplayed upon a musical instrument and sang to it so amusingly that thetailor straightway carried him to his wife. So delighted by thehunchback's singing was the tailor's wife that she cooked a dish of fishand the three sat down to be merry. But in the midst of the feast a bonestuck in the hunchback's throat and before a man could stare he wasdead. Afraid that they should be accused of murder the tailor conspiredwith his wife what they should do. "I have it" said he and getting apiece of money he sallied forth at dark with the hunchback's body andarrived before the house of a doctor.Here knocked he on the door and giving the maid a piece of money badeher hasten the doctor to his need. So soon as the maid's back was
comment43,turned he placed the hunchback on the top stair and fled. Now thedoctor coming quickly struck against the corpse so that it fell to thebottom of the stairs. "Woe is me for I have killed a patient" said heand fearing to be accused of murder carried the body in to his wife.Now they had a neighbour who was absent from home and going to his roomthey placed the corpse against the fireplace. This man returning andcrying out "So it is not the rats who plunder my larder" began tobelabour the hunchback till the body rolled over and lay still. Then ingreat fear of his deed this Mussulman carried the corpse into thestreet and placed it upright against a shop.Came by a Christian merchant at dawn of day and running against thehunchback tumbled him over then thinking himself attacked he struck thebody and at that moment the watch came by and haled the merchant beforethe sultan.Now the hunchback was a favourite of the sultan and he ordered theChristian merchant to be executed.To the scaffold just when death was to be done came the Mussulman andconfessed that he was the murderer. So the executioner released theChristian and was about to hang the other when the doctor came andconfessed to being the murderer. So the doctor took the place of theMussulman when the tailor and his wife hastened to the scene andconfessed that they were guilty.Now when this story came to the ears of the sultan he said "Great isAllah whose will must be done" and he released all of them andcommanded this story of the hunchback to be written in a book._VI.--Aladdin or the Wonderful Lamp_There was in the old time a bad and idle boy who lived with his mothera poor widow and gave her much unrest. And there came to him one day awicked magician who called himself the boy's uncle and made richpresents to the mother and one day he led Aladdin out to make him amerchant. Now the magician knew by his magic of a vast hoard of wealthtogether with a wonderful lamp which lay in the earth buried inAladdin's name. And he sent the boy to fetch the lamp giving him amagic ring and waited on the earth for his return. But Aladdin hispockets full of jewels refused to give up the lamp till his false unclehelped him to the surface of the earth and in rage the magician causedthe stone to fall upon the cave and left Aladdin to die.But as he wept wringing his hands the genie of the magic ring
comment44,appeared and by his aid Aladdin was restored to his mother. There withthe genie of the lamp to wait upon him he lived till seeing thesultan's daughter pass on her way to the bath he conceived violent lovefor her and sent his mother to the sultan with all his wonderfuljewels asking the princess in marriage. The sultan astonished by thegift of jewels set Aladdin to perform prodigies of wonder but allthese he accomplished by aid of the genie so that at last the sultanwas obliged to give him the princess in marriage. And Aladdin caused agreat pavilion to rise near the sultan's palace and this was one of thewonders of the world and there he abode in honour and fame.Then the wicked magician knowing by magic the glory of Aladdin camedisguised crying "New Lamps for Old" and one of the maids in thepavilion gave him the wonderful lamp and received a new one from thecoppersmith. The magician transplanted the pavilion to Africa andAladdin coming home found the sultan enraged against him and hispalace vanished. But by means of the genie of the ring he discovered thewhereabouts of his pavilion and going thither slew the magicianpossessed himself anew of the lamp and restored his pavilion to itsformer site.But the magician's wicked brother plotting revenge obtained access tothe princess in disguise of a holy woman he had foully murdered and hewould have certainly slain Aladdin but for a warning of the genie bywhich Aladdin was enabled to kill the magician. After that Aladdin livedin glory and peace and ascended in due course to the throne andreigned with honour and mercy._VII.--Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves_Now the father of Ali Baba left both his sons poor but Kasim married arich wife and so he lived plenteously while his poor brother AliBaba worked in the wood. It came to pass that Ali Baba one day saw inthe wood a company of forty robbers the captain of whom cried "OpenSesame" to a great rock and lo it opened and the men disappeared.When they were gone out again Ali Baba came from his hiding andaddressing the rock in the same way found that it obeyed him. Then wenthe in and took much of the treasure which he drove home on his mule.Now when his wife sent to the brother Kasim for scales wherewith shemight weigh all this treasure the sister-in-law being suspicious thatone so poor should have need of scales smeared the bottom of the panwith wax and grease and discovered on the return a gold piece. This sheshowed to Kasim who made Ali Baba confess the tale. Then Kasim went tothe cave entered loaded much treasure and was about to depart whenhe found he had forgotten the magic words whereby he entered. There washe found by the forty thieves who slew and quartered him. Ali Baba
comment45,found the quarters took them home got a blind tailor to sew themtogether and gave his brother burial.Now the robbers discovered Ali Baba's house and they hid themselves inoil-jars hung on the backs of mules and the captain drove them. Thuscame they to Ali Baba's house and the captain craved lodging forhimself and his beasts. Surely would Ali Baba have been capturedtortured and put to death but for his maid the faithful and astuteMorgiana who discovered men in the jars and boiling cans of oilpoured it upon them one by one and so delivered her master. But thecaptain had escaped and Ali Baba still went in great fear of his life.But when he returned disguised so that he might have puzzled thewisest Morgiana recognised the enemy of her master and she was dancingbefore him and filling his eyes with pleasure and when it came for herto take the tambourine and go round for largess she strengthened herheart and quick as the blinding lightning plunged a dagger into hisvitals. Thus did the faithful Morgiana save her master and he marriedher to his nephew the son of Kasim and they lived long in great joyand blessing._VIII.--The Fisherman and the Genie_There was once a poor fisherman who every day cast his net four timesinto the sea. On a day he went forth and casting in his net drew upwith great labour a dead jackass casting again an earthen pitcher fullof sand casting a third time vexatiously potsherds and shatteredglass and at the last a jar of yellow copper leaden-capped andstamped with the seal-ring of Solomon the son of David. His rage wassilenced at sight of the sacred seal and removing the cap smokeissued which taking vast shape became a terrible genie frightful tosee.Said the genie "By what manner of death wilt thou die for I havesworn by Allah to slay the man who freed me" He moreover explainedhow Solomon had placed him in the jar for heresy and how he had lainall those years at the bottom of the sea. For a hundred years he saidhe swore that he would make rich for ever and ever the man who freedhim for the next hundred that for such an one he would open the hoardsof the earth then that he would perfectly fulfil such an one's threewishes finally in his rage that he would kill the man who freed him.Now the fisherman having pleaded in vain said that he did not believethe tale seeing that so huge a genie could never have got into so smalla jar. Whereat the genie made smoke of himself and re-entered the vase.Instantly then did the fisherman stopper it nor would he let the geniefree till that wicked one had promised to spare his life and do himservice. Grudgingly and wrathfully did the genie issue forth but beingnow under oath to Allah he spared the fisherman and did him service.
comment46,He took him to a lake in the black mountains bade him throw in his netand bear the catch to the sultan. Now by the fisherman's catching offour fish all of a different hue the sultan discovered that this lakein the mountains was once a populous and mighty city whereof the princeand all the inhabitants had been bewitched in ancient time. When thecity was restored and all those many people called back to life thesultan enriched the fisherman who lived afterwards in wealth._IX.--The Enchanted Horse_In olden times there came to the Court of Persia a stranger from Indriding a horse made of wood which said he could fly whithersoever itsrider wished. When the sultan had seen the horse fly to a mountain andback he asked the Hindu its price and said the man "Thy daughter'shand." Now the prince standing by was enraged at this insolence buthis father said "Have no fear that I should do this thing. Howsoeverlest another king become possessed of the horse I will bargain for it."But the impetuous prince doubting the truth of the horse's powerjumped upon its back turned the peg which he had observed the Hindu toturn and instantly was borne far away.The king enraged that the Hindu could not bring back his son had theman cast into prison albeit the Hindu protested that soon the princemust discover the secret of stopping the horse by means of a second pegand therefore would soon return.Now the prince did not discover this secret till he was far away and itwas night. He came to earth near a palace and going in found there anexquisite lady sleeping and knew by her dress that she was of a rankequal with his own. Then he pleaded to her for succour and sheconstrained him to stay and for many weeks he abode as a guest. Afterthat time he said "Come to my father's court that we may be married"And early one dawn he bore her to Persia on the back of the enchantedhorse.So glad was the king at his son's return that he released the Hindu.Now the Hindu hearing what had happened determined on revenge. Hefound where the horse was placed and going to the palace where theforeign princess was housed sent for her in the sultan's name and shecame to him. Then he seated her upon the horse and mounting up in fullview of the sultan and his royal son flew far away with his lovelycaptive.
comment47,It was the Hindu's desire to marry this princess but when they werecome to earth she withstood him and cried for help and succour. To hercame the sultan of that place and slew the Hindu and would havemarried her but she was faithful to her lover and feigned madness.Then the sultan offered rewards to any who should cure her of thisfrightful madness and many physicians came and failed. Now her loverdistracted at sight of seeing her in mid-air with the Hindu had turnedHoly Man roaming the earth without hope like one who is doomed.It happened that he came to the palace where the princess lay in herfeigned madness and hearing the tale of her and of the enchantedhorse with new hope and a great joy in his heart he went in disguisedas a physician and in secret made himself known.Then he stood before the sultan of that land and said "From theenchanted horse hath she contracted this madness and by the enchantedhorse shall she lose it." And he gave orders to dress her in gloriousarray to crown her with jewels and gold and to lead her forth to thepalace square.A vast concourse assembled there and the prince set his beloved lady onthe horse and pretending incantations leapt suddenly upon its backturned the peg and as the enchanted steed flew towards Persia over hisshoulder cried the glad prince "When next O sultan thou wouldst marrya princess who implores thy protection ask first for her consent."                                   AUCASSIN AND NICOLETTESong-Story of the Twelfth Century     If "Old Antif" of Hainault was as the best authorities now     incline to think the author of "Aucassin and Nicolette"     Belgium may claim to have produced the finest poet of the ages     of chivalry. He was probably a contemporary of the English     minstrel king Richard the Lion-hearted. But nothing is known     of him save what can be gathered from the exquisite story of     love which he composed in his old age. Perhaps he too was     in his younger days a Crusader as well as a minstrel and     fought in the Holy Land against the Saracens. His "song-story"     is certainly Arabian both in form and substance. Even his     hero Aucassin the young Christian lord of Beaucaire bears     an Arabian name--Alcazin. There is nothing in Mohammedan     literature equal to "Aucassin and Nicolette." It can be     compared only with Shakespeare's "As You Like It." The old
comment48,     sorrowful tender-hearted minstrel knight who wandered from     castle to castle in Hainault and Picardy seven hundred years     ago is one of the master-singers of the world._I.--Lovers Young and Fair_    Listen to a tale of love    Which an old grey captive wove.    Great delight and solace he    Found in his captivity    As he told what toils beset    Aucassin and Nicolette    And the dolour undergone    And the deeds of prowess done    By a lad of noble race    For a lady fair of face.    Though a man be old and blind    Sick in body and in mind    If he hearken he shall be    Filled with joy and jollity    So delectable and sweet    Is the tale I now repeat.Now a war broke out between Count Bougars of Valence and Count Garin ofBeaucaire and Count Bougars besieged Beaucaire with a hundred knightsand ten thousand men. Then Count Garin who was old and feeble said tohis fair young son Aucassin"Now son go and defend our land and people.""I tell you" said Aucassin "I will never draw sword unless I have mysweet love Nicolette to wife.""And I tell you" said his father "that I would liefer lose life andland than see you wedded to her. What A Saracen girl bought by one ofmy captains A slave A heathen A witch God I will burn her in afire and you with her.""Stay" said Aucassin. "I will make an agreement. I will fight CountBougars if you will let me speak to Nicolette after the battle.""I agree" said his father. And he said this because Count Bougars waswell night master of Beaucaire.Aucassin went out to battle in great joy. But his father went in greatanger to the captain that had bought Nicolette from the Saracens andsaid"If I lay hands on that heathen girl I will burn her in a fire and youalso unless you have a care."And the captain who had adopted Nicolette as his daughter was afraidboth for himself and for his godchild. And he hid her in the tower thatstood in the garden of his house.    In the tower that Nicolette    Prisoned is may no man get.    Pleasant is her room to see    Carved and painted wondrously.    But no pleasure can she find    In the paintings to her mind.    Look For she is standing there    By the window with her hair    Yellow like autumnal wheat    When the sunshine falls on it.    Blue-grey eyes she has and brows
comment49,    Whiter than the winter snows    And her face is like a flower    As she gazes from the tower    As she gazes far below    Where the garden roses blow    And the thrush and blackbird sing    In the pleasant time of spring.    "Woe is me" she cries "that I    In a prison cell must lie    Parted by a cruel spite    From my young and lovely knight.    By the eyes of God I swear    Prisonment I will not bear    Here for long I shall not stay    Love will quickly find a way."In the meantime Aucassin mounted a great war-horse and rode out tobattle. Still dreaming of Nicolette he let the reins fall and hishorse carried him among his foes. They took him prisoner and sent wordto Count Bougars to come and see them hang the heir of Beaucaire."Ha" said Aucassin waking out of his dream. "Ha my God My SaviourIf they hang me I shall never see my sweet love Nicolette again"Striking out in a great passion he made a havoc about him like a boarthat turns at bay on the hounds in a forest. Ten knights he struck downand seven he wounded. Then spying Count Bougars that had come to seehim hanged he lashed at his helm and stunned him and took himprisoner to Beaucaire."Father" he said "here is Count Bougars. The war is ended. Now let mesee Nicolette.""I will not" said his father. "That is my last word in this matter. Sohelp me God.""Count Bougars" said Aucassin "you are my prisoner. I will have apledge from you give me your hand." Count Bougars gave his hand."Pledge me" said Aucassin "that if I set you free you will do myfather all the hurt and damage and shame you can for he is a liar.""In God's name" said Count Bougars "put me to ransom and take all mywealth but do not mock me""Are you my prisoner" said Aucassin."Yes" said Count Bougars."Then so help me God" said Aucassin "I will now send your head fromyour shoulders unless I have that pledge"Thereupon Count Bougars pledged him and Aucassin set him free. ThenAucassin went to the captain that was godfather to Nicolette. "What haveyou done with my sweet lady" he asked."You will never again see Nicolette my fair lord" said the captain."What would you gain if you took the Saracen maid to bed Your soulwould go to hell. You would never win to heaven""And what of that" said Aucassin. "Who is it that win to heaven Oldpriests and cripples that grovel and pray at altars and tatteredbeggars that die of cold and hunger. These only go to heaven and I donot want their company. So I will go to hell. For there go all goodscholars and the brave knights that died in wars and sweet ladies thathad many lovers and harpers and minstrels and great kings. Give mebut my Nicolette and gladly I will keep them company."_II.--Love's Song in a Dungeon_Aucassin returned very sorrowfully to the castle and there his fatherput him into a dungeon.    Aucassin is cast and bound    In a dungeon underground    Never does the sunlight fall    Shining on his prison wall    Only one faint ray of it    Glimmers down a narrow slit.    But does Aucassin forget    His sweet lady Nicolette    Listen He is singing there    And his song is all of her    "Though for love of thee I die    In this dungeon where I lie    Wonder of the world I will    Worship thee and praise thee still    By the beauty of thy face    By the joy of thy embrace    By the rapture of thy kiss    And thy body's sweetnesses    Miracle of loveliness    Comfort me in my distress    Surely 'twas but yesterday
comment50,    That the pilgrim came this way--    Weak and poor and travel-worn--    Who in Limousin was born.    With the falling sickness he    Stricken was full grievously.    He had prayed to many a saint    For the cure of his complaint    But no healing did he get    Till he saw my Nicolette.    Even as he lay down to die    Nicolette came walking by.    On her shining limbs he gazed    As her kirtle she upraised.    And he rose from off the ground    Healed and joyful whole and sound.    Miracle of loveliness    Comfort me in my distress"As Aucassin was singing in his dungeon Nicolette was devising how toget out of her tower. It was now summer time in the month of May whenthe day is warm long and clear and the night still and serene.Nicolette lay on her bed and the moonlight streamed through the windowand the nightingale sang in the garden below and she thought ofAucassin her lover whom she loved and of Count Garin who hated her."I will stay here no longer" said Nicolette "or the count will find meand kill me."The old woman that was set to watch over her was asleep. Nicolette puton her fine silken kirtle and took the bedclothes and knotted themtogether and made a rope. This she fastened to the bar of her windowand so got down from the tower. Then she lifted up her kirtle with bothhands because the dew was lying deep on the grass and went away downthe garden.Her locks were yellow and curled her eyes blue-grey and laughing herlips were redder than the cherry or rose in summertime her teeth whiteand small so slim was her waist that you could have clipped her in yourtwo hands and so firm were her breasts that they rose against herbodice as if they were two apples. The daisies that bent above herinstep and broke beneath her light tread looked black against herfeet so white the maiden was.She came to the postern gate and unbarred it and went out through thestreets of Beaucaire keeping always in the shadows for the moon wasshining. And so she got to the dungeon where her lover Aucassin lay.She thrust her head through the chink and there she heard Aucassingrieving for her whom he loved so much."Ah Aucassin" she said. "Never will you have joy of me. Your fatherhates me to death and I must cross the sea and go to some strangeland.""If you were to go away" said Aucassin "you would kill me. The firstman that saw you would take you to his bed. And then do you think Iwould wait till I found a knife No I would dash my head to piecesagainst a wall or a rock.""Ah" she said. "I love you more than you love me.""Nay my sweet lady" said he. "Woman cannot love man as much as manloves woman. Woman only loves with her eyes man loves with his heart."Aucassin and Nicolette were thus debating when the soldiers of thecount came marching down the street. Their swords were drawn and theywere seeking for Nicolette to slay her."God it were a great pity to kill so fair a maid" said the warden ofthe dungeon. "My young lord Aucassin would die of it and that would bea great loss to Beaucaire. Would that I could warn Nicolette"
comment51,And with that he struck up a merry tune but the words he sang to itwere not merry.    Lady with the yellow hair    Lovely sweet and debonair      Now take heed.    Death comes on thee unaware.    Turn thee now oh turn and flee    Death is coming suddenly.          And the swords    Flash that seek to murder thee."May God reward you for your fair words" said Nicolette.Wrapping herself in her mantle she hid in the shadows until thesoldiers went by. Then she said farewell to Aucassin and climbed up thecastle-wall where it had been broken in the siege. But steep and deepwas the moat and Nicolette's fair hands and feet were bleeding when shegot out. But she did not feel any pain because of the great fear thatwas on her lest she should fall into the hands of the count's men.Within two bow-shots from Beaucaire was a great forest and hereNicolette slept in a thicket until the herd-boys came in the morningand pastured their cattle close to her resting-place. They sat down by afountain and spread out a cloak and put their bread on it. Theirshouting aroused Nicolette and she came to them."God bless you sweet boys" said she."God bless you lady" said one that had a readier tongue than theothers."Do you know Aucassin the brave young son of Count Garin" she said."Yes lady" they said. "We know him very well.""Then tell him in the name of God" said she "that there is a beast inthis forest that he must come and hunt. If he can take it he will notsell a limb of it for a hundred marks of gold. Nay not for any money.""I tell him that" said the boy that had a readier tongue than theothers. "Curse me if I do There's no beast in this forest--stag boarwolf or lion--with a limb worth more than two or three pence. You speakof some enchantment and you are a fairy woman. We do not want yourcompany. Go away.""Sweet boys" said Nicolette "you must do as I tell you. For the beasthas a medicine that will cure Aucassin of all his pain. Ah I have fivepieces of money in my purse. Take them and tell him. He must come andhunt within three days and if he does not he will never be cured.""Faith" said the boy after consulting with his fellows "we shall tellhim if he comes but we will not search after him"_III.--Aucassin Goes in Quest of Nicolette_Nicolette took leave of the herd-boys and went into the forest down agreen way that led to a place where seven paths met. Close at hand was adeep thicket and there Nicolette built a lodge of green boughs andcovered it with oak-leaves and lily-flowers and made it sweet andpleasant both inside and out. And she stayed in this lodge to see whatAucassin would do.In the meantime the cry went through all the country that Nicolette waslost. Some said that she had gone away others that Count Garin had puther to death. If any man had joy in the news that man was not Aucassin.His father let him out of prison and summoned all the knights andladies of the land to a great feast that he made to comfort his youngson. But when the revelry was at its height there was Aucassin leaningdespondently from a gallery sorrowful and utterly downcast. And an oldknight saw him and came to him."Aucassin" he said "there was a time when I too was sick with thesickness that you have. If you will trust me I will give you some goodcounsel.""Gramercy" answered Aucassin. "Good counsel is indeed a preciousthing.""Mount your horse and ride into the forest" said the old knight. "Youwill see the flowers and the sweet herbs and hear the birds singing.And perchance you may also hear a word that will take away yoursickness.""Gramercy" said Aucassin. "That is what I will do."He stole out of the hall and went to the stable and bridled andsaddled his horse and rode swiftly out into the forest. By the fountainhe found the herd-boys. They had spread a cloak out on the grass andwere eating their bread and making merry.    Jolly herd-boys every one    Martin Emery and John    Aubrey Oliver and Matt    By the fountain-side they sat.    "Here" said John "comes Aucassin
comment52,    Son of our good Count Garin.    Faith he is a handsome boy    Let us wish him luck and joy."    "And the girl with yellow hair    Wandering in the forest there"    Aubrey said. "She gave us more    Gold than we have seen before.    Say what shall we go and buy"    "Cakes" said greedy Emery.    "Flutes and bagpipes" Johnny said.    "No" cried Martin "knives instead    Knives and swords Then we can go    Out to war and fight the foe.""Sweet boys" said Aucassin as he rode up to them "sing again the songthat you were singing just now I pray you.""We will not" said Aubrey who had a readier tongue than the others."Do you not know me then" said Aucassin."Yes" said Aubrey. "You are our young lord Aucassin. But we are notyour men but the count's.""Sweet boys sing it again I pray you" said Aucassin."God's heart" cried Aubrey. "Why should I sing for you if I do notwant to There is no man in this country--save Count Garin--that daredrive my cattle from his fields and corn-lands if I put them there. Hewould lose his eyes for it no matter how rich he were. So now whyshould I sing for you if I do not want to""In the name of God" said Aucassin "take these ten sous and sing it""Sir I will take your money" said Aubrey "but I will not sing youanything. Still if you like I will tell you something.""By God" said Aucassin "something is better than nothing""Sir" said Aubrey then "we were eating our bread by this fountainbetween prime and tierce and a maid came by--the loveliest thing in allthe world. She lighted up the forest with her beauty so we thought shewas a fairy woman. But she gave us some money and we promised that ifyou came by we would tell you to go hunting in the forest. In there is abeast of marvellous value. If you took it you would not sell one of itslimbs for many marks of gold for it has a medicine that will cure yoursickness. Now I have told you all.""And you have told me enough sweet boy" said Aucassin. "Farewell Godgive me good hunting"And as he spurred his horse into the forest Aucassin sang rightjoyously    Track of boar and slot of deer    Neither do I follow here.    Nicolette I hotly chase    Down the winding woodland ways--    Thy white body thy blue eyes    Thy sweet smiles and low replies    God in heaven give me grace    Once to meet thee face to face    Once to meet as we have met    Nicolette--oh Nicolette_IV.--Love in the Forest_Furiously did his horse bear him on through the thorns and briars thattore his clothes and scratched his body so that you could have followedthe track of his blood on the grass. But neither hurt nor pain did hefeel for he thought only of Nicolette. All day he sought for her in theforest and when evening drew on he began to weep because he had notfound her. Night fell but still he rode on and he came at last to theplace where the seven roads met and there he saw the lodge of greenboughs and lily-flowers which Nicolette had made."Ah heaven" said Aucassin "here Nicolette has been and she has madethis lodge with her own fair hands For the sweetness of it and forlove of her I will sleep here to-night."As he sat in the lodge Aucassin saw the evening star shining through agap in the boughs and he sang    Star of eve Oh star of love    Gleaming in the sky above    Nicolette the bright of brow    Dwells with thee in heaven now.    God has set her in the skies    To delight my longing eyes    And her clear and yellow hair    Shines upon the darkness there.    Oh my lady would that I    Swiftly up to thee could fly.    Meet thee greet thee kiss thee fold thee    To my aching heart and hold thee.    Here without thee nothing worth    Can I find upon the earth.When Nicolette heard Aucassin singing she came into the bower andthrew her arms around his neck and kissed him. Aucassin then set hissweet love upon his horse and mounted behind her and with all hastethey rode out from the forest and came to the seashore.There Aucassin saw a ship sailing upon the sea and he beckoned to itand the sailors took him and Nicolette on board and they sailed to the
comment53,land of Torelore. And the King of Torelore welcomed them courteouslyand for two whole years they lived in great delight in his beautifulcastle by the sea. But one night the castle was suddenly stormed by theSaracens and Aucassin was bound hand and foot and thrown into a shipand Nicolette into another.The ship that carried Aucassin was wrecked in a great storm and itdrifted over the sea to Beaucaire. The people that ran to break up thewreck found their young lord and made great joy over his return. Forhis father was dead and he was now Count Aucassin. The people led himto the castle and did homage to him and he held all his lands inpeace. But little delight had Aucassin in his wealth and power andkingdom.    Though he lived in joy and ease    And his kingdom was at peace    Aucassin did so regret    His sweet lady Nicolette    That he would have liefer died    In the battle by her side.    "Ah my Nicolette" he said    "Are you living are you dead    All my kingdom I would give    For the news that still you live.    For the joy of finding you    Would I search the whole world through    Did I think you living yet    Nicolette--my Nicolette"_V.--Nicolette's Love Song_In the meantime the Saracens took Nicolette to their great city ofCarthage and because she was lovely and seemed of noble birth they ledher to their king. And when Nicolette saw the King of Carthage she knewhim again and he also knew her. For she was his daughter who had beencarried off in her young days by the Christians. Her father held a greatfeast in honour of Nicolette and would have married her to a mightyking of Paynim. But Nicolette had no mind to marry anyone but Aucassinand she devised how she might get news of her lover. One night shesmeared her face with a brown ointment and dressed herself inminstrel's clothes and took a viol and stole out of her father'spalace to the seashore. There she found a ship that was bound forProvence and she sailed in it to Beaucaire. She took her viol and wentplaying through the town and came to the castle. Aucassin was sittingon the castle steps with his proud barons and brave knights around himgazing sorrowfully at the sweet flowers and listening to the singing ofthe birds."Shall I sing you a new song sire" said Nicolette."Yes fair friend" said Aucassin "if it be a merry one for I am verysad.""If you like it" said Nicolette "you will find it merry enough."She drew the bow across her viol and made sweet music and then shesung    Once a lover met a maid    Wandering in a forest glade    Where she had a pretty house    Framed with flowers and leafy boughs.    Maid and lover merrily    Sailed away across the sea    To a castle by the strand    Of a strange and pleasant land.    There they lived in great delight    Till the Saracens by night    Stormed the keep and took the maid    With the captives of their raid.    Back to Carthage they returned    And the maiden sadly mourned.    But they did not make of her    Paramour or prisoner.    For the King of Carthage said    When he saw the fair young maid    "Daughter" and the maid replied    "Father" And they laughed and cried.    For she had been stolen when    She was young by Christian men.    And the captain of Beaucaire    Bought her as a slave-girl there.
comment54,    Once her lover loved her well    Now alas he cannot tell    Who she is. Does he forget--    Aucassin--his NicoletteAucassin leaped down the castle steps and took his lady in his arms.Then she went to the house of her godfather the captain of the townand washed all the brownness from her face and clad herself in robes ofrich silk. And early on the morrow Count Aucassin wedded her and madeher Lady of Beaucaire and they had great joy of one another. And heremy song-story ends. I know no more.                                   BERTHOLD AUERBACHOn the Height     Berthold Auerbach a German poet and author of Jewish     descent was born at Nordstetten in Wrtemberg on February     28 1812. On the completion of his studies at the universities     of Tbingen Munich and Heidelberg he immediately devoted     himself to literature. His first publication dealt with     "Judaism and Recent Literature" and was to be followed by a     series of novels taken from Jewish history. Of this intended     series he actually published with considerable success     "Spinoza" and "Poet and Merchant." But real fame and     popularity came to him when he began to occupy himself with     the life of the general people which forms the subject of his     best-known works. In these later books of which "On the     Height" is perhaps the most characteristic and certainly the     most famous he revealed an unrivalled insight into the soul     of the Southern German country folk and especially of the     peasants of the Black Forest and the Bavarian Alps. His     descriptions are remarkable for their fresh realism graceful     style and humour. In addition to these qualities his last     books are marked by great subtlety of psychological analysis.     "On the Height" was first published at Stuttgart in 1861 and     has been translated into several languages. Auerbach died at     Cannes on February 8 1882 when all Germany was preparing to     celebrate his 70th birthday._I.--A Peasant Nurse in a Royal Palace_Walpurga was as in a dream. It had all happened so quickly Only afortnight ago on the walk home from Sunday Mass at the village churchher Hanse had to make a hay bed for her on a stone-heap by the
comment55,roadside. She had thought she could not get back to the cottage in timebut she recovered after a while and bravely walked home. Her mother waswith her in the hour of suffering as she had been with her through allthe joys and sorrows of her simple life. Then came the supreme joy ofthe awakening with a new life by her side a baby-girl gropinghelplessly for the mother's breast. Then--was it only yesterday--whenshe was waiting for the return of the christening party a carriagedrove up with the village doctor and an elegant stranger. There was muchbeating about the bush and then it came out like a thunderbolt. Thestranger was a great doctor from the capital entrusted with the missionto find in the mountains an honest comely peasant woman and marriedshe must be to act as wet-nurse for the expected crown prince orprincess.Then Hanse came home with the merry party--there was much storming andangry refusal but finally the practical sense of the peasant folkprevailed. It was after all only for a year and it would mean comfortand wealth instead of hunger and grinding poverty. And scarcely hadtheir consent been wrung from them when shouting and cheering announcedthe great event of the crown prince's birth. Then came that strangelong drive over hill and dale through the dark night and now in theRoyal Palace she tried to collect herself to grasp the meaning of allthat splendour the unintelligible ceremonious talk and bearing of thoseabout her. She was to be taken at once to see the queen and her preciouscharge.Walpurga was full of happiness when she left the queen's bedroom.Touched by the comely young peasant-woman's naive and familiarkindliness the queen who seemed to her beautiful as an angel hadkissed her and on noticing a tear had said "Don't cry Walpuga Youare a mother too like myself" The little prince took to his nursewithout much trouble and she soon became accustomed to her new lifealthough her thoughts often dwelt longingly on her native mountains herown child and mother and husband. How they would miss her She knew herHanse was a good man at heart but not particularly shrewd and easilygulled or led astray.Meanwhile her high spirits her artless bluntness the quaintsuperstitions of the mountain child gained her the goodwill andapproval of the king and queen of Dr. Gunther the court physician ofthe whole royal household and above all of the lady-in-waitingCountess Irma Wildenort._II.--The Love Affairs of a King_Countess Irma's letters to Emmy her only convent friend containedlittle of idle gossip and of things that had happened. They had nocontinuity. They were introspective and took the form of a diary takenup at odd moments and left again to be continued sometimes thefollowing day sometimes after a week. They revealed intellectualdevelopment far in advance of her years and clear perception ofcharacter."The queen lives in an exclusive world of sentiment and would like toraise everybody to her exalted mood--liana-like in the morning-glow andevening-glow of sentiment never in white daylight. She is most gracioustowards me but we feel it instinctively--there is something in her andin me that does not harmonise...."Here all of them think me boundlessly nave because I have the courage
comment56,to think for myself...."The king loves reserve but also gay freeness. The queen is tooserious--eternal organ sound but you cannot dance to an organ and weare young and love to dance."A peasant woman from the mountains is nurse to the crown prince. I waswith her at the king's request. I stood by the cot when the kingarrived. He said to me gently 'It is true an angel stands by thechild's cradle.' He laid his hand upon mine which rested on the rail ofthe cot. The king went. And just imagine what occurred. The nurse afresh merry person with blue eyes buxom and massive a perfect peasantbeauty to whom I showed friendliness so as to cheer her up and saveher from feeling homesick the nurse tells me in bald words 'You are anadulteress You have exchanged loving glances with the king'"Emmy How you were right in telling me that I idealise the people andthat they are as corrupt as the great world and moreover without thecurb of culture."No she is a good intelligent woman. She begged my pardon for herimpertinence I remain friendly towards her. Yes I will."Irma's devotion to her king had something of hero-worship. And the kingwho loved his wife sincerely but was and wanted to be of a heroicnature and who was averse to all that savoured of self-torment andsentimentality was attracted by Countess Irma's intellectual freedomand _esprit_. He felt in her a kindred spirit. Her company wasstimulating it could not affect the even tenour of his conjugal love.But the queen in her sentimental exultation sought ever for new"documents" to demonstrate the depth of her affection. And now shewanted to give the supreme proof by renouncing her Lutheran faith toenter into a yet closer union with her Catholic husband. To the kingthis sacrifice seemed not only sentimentally weak but politicallyunwise. He received the confidence coldly and begged her to reconsiderthe matter. He sent Dr. Gunther who in spite of his democratictendencies was held in high esteem by the king and had great influenceover the queen to exercise his persuasive powers--with no result.Where wisdom and experience had failed the voice of Nature speakingout of Walpurga's childish chatter succeeded. Walpurga told the queenof her father--how one day on the lake on hearing the choral singing ofthe peasants he had said "Now I know how the Almighty feels up therein Heaven All the Churches ours and the Lutheran and the Jewish andthe Turkish they are all voices in the song. Each sings as he knowsand yet it sounds well together up there." The queen was radiant nextday when she informed her spouse that she had the courage of her owninconsistency and that she had resolved to do his will. The sacrificewas received with coolness. Was it that her noble act was construed asfurther evidence of weakness
comment57,The king had left town for some distant watering-place and hadrequested Irma to write to him at times. Knowing her love of flowers hehad given orders for a fresh bouquet to be placed every day in her roomand perhaps to conceal the favour in the rooms of two other ladies ofthe court. Irma considered both the thought and the expedient unworthyof her hero and resolved not to write to him. She spent much of hertime at the studio of a professor of the academy who not only modelleda bust of her for a figure of Victory to be placed on the new arsenalbut gave her instruction in his art. In spite of this new occupationshe found herself in a state of feverish excitement which became almostunbearable when the queen showed her a passage in a letter just receivedfrom the king. "Please make Countess Irma send me regular reports aboutour son. Remember me to the dear fourth leaf of our clover-leaf."She was indignant at this unworthy attempt at forcing her to write. WasWalpurga right after all Were lovers' glances to be exchanged over thechild's cradle She longed for solitude and peace. On the way to herroom she had to stop to think where she was. A gallop might cool herfeverish head. She ordered her horse to be saddled but had scarcelychanged into her riding-habit when a letter was handed to her which wasunsealed with trembling fingers. It was a simply worded invitation fromher father who wished to see her again after her long absence at court.Here was salvation balm for her aching heart She gave a few ordersthen hurried to the queen's apartments to obtain leave of absence andaccompanied by her maid sped to her paternal home the same evening asfast as the horses would carry her.The days passed quickly at the manor house where Irma for the firsttime gained an insight into the noble mind and firm character of herfather. In his many soothing talks Count Eberhard told her of hisregrets at having been forced by circumstances--her mother's deathbefore Irma had reached the age of three and his inability to give hera proper education in his mountain retreat--to send her first to heraunt then to the convent and thus neglecting his duties as father. Aword from him would have decided her to remain under his roof but theold philosopher held that each intelligent being must work out its owndestiny and would not influence her decision. His slighting remarksabout the monarchic system about the impossibility of the king withall his noble intentions being able to see the world as it is sinceeverybody approaches him in pleasing costume struck the final jarringnote and destroyed the complete understanding between father anddaughter. A half jocular joint letter from the king and his _entourage_in which the signatories expressed in exaggerated terms their longingfor her presence at court decided her to return.The carriage having been sent to the valley in advance Count Eberhardwalked down with Irma until they came to the apple-tree which he hadplanted on the day of his daughter's birth. He stopped and picked up afallen apple. "Let us part here" he said. "Take this fruit from yournative soil. The apple has left the tree because it has ripened becausethe tree cannot give any more to it. So man leaves home and family. Butman is more than the fruit of a tree. Come my child I hold your dear
comment58,head don't weep--or weep May you never weep for yourself and only forothers Remain faithful to yourself I would give you all my thoughtsremember but the one Yield only to such pleasures as will be pleasurein recollection. Take this kiss. You kiss passionately. May you nevergive a kiss that does not leave your soul as pure and full as it is now.Farewell"_III.--Walpurga Returns Home_Twelve months had passed since Walpurga's arrival at court. Her trunkswere now packed she had given a last kiss to the boy prince and nowshe asked her Hanse who had brought a carriage from the village totake her home to wait in the corridor while she took leave fromCountess Irma. She found Irma still in her bed very pale with her hairin loose strains on the pillow."I wanted to give you a souvenir" said Irma "but I think money will bebest for you. Look on the table and take it all. I don't want any ofit. Take it and don't be afraid it is real money won honestly at thetables. I always win always... Take your kerchief and wrap it up." Theroom was so dusky that Walpurga looked around in superstitious fear. Themoney might be evil she quickly made the sign of the Cross over it andput it into her ample pocket. "And now farewell" said Irma. "Be happy.You are happier than any of us. If ever I don't know where to go Ishall come to you. You'll have me won't you Now go--go I must sleep.And don't forget me Walpurga. Don't thank me don't speak""Oh please let me speak just one word We both can't know which of uswill die and then it would be too late. I don't know what's the matterwith you. You are not well and you may get worse. You often have coldhands and hot cheeks. I wronged you that day soon after I arrived. I'llnever think bad of you again no one shall say evil of you but pleaseget away from the castle Go home to----""Enough" exclaimed Irma thrusting forth her hands as though Walpurga'swords were stones thrown at her. "Farewell and don't forget me." Sheheld out her hand for Walpurga to kiss it was hot and feverish.Walpurga went. The parrot in the ante-room screamed "Good-bye Irma."Walpurga was frightened and ran away as though she were chased.Walpurga's homecoming was not pleasure unalloyed. She did not miss theluxuries to which she had become accustomed. She rather relished thehard manual labour to which she applied herself with full energy. Buther baby was a stranger to her cried when she wished to take her upand became only gradually accustomed to her. Her faculties had beensharpened too she felt a certain shyness in her husband noticed hisweaknesses and was deeply hurt when on the second evening after herreturn he went to the inn "so that people should not say he was underher thumb." Then Hanse coaxed by the shrewd innkeeper had set hisheart upon acquiring the inn now that they had "wealth" and upon thusbecoming the most important man in the village. But with much tact andcleverness Walpurga made him give up the plan thereby arousing theinnkeeper's hostility which became rampant when the reunited couple didnot appear at a kind of fete which he gave ostensibly in their honourbut really to benefit by the proceeds. By this slight the esteem andadmiration of the whole village were turned to ill-will and spite.Hanse and Walpurga were almost boycotted but their isolation made themdraw closer together work harder and enjoy to the fullest the harmonyof their domestic life. Moreover the freehold farmer Grubersepp whowas a personage in the district and had never before deigned to takemuch notice of Hanse now called at the cottage and offered his adviceon many questions. When on a Sunday the village doctor and the priestwere seen to visit the cottage opinion began to veer around once morein the good people's favour.It was Walpurga's old uncle Peter a poor pitch-burner who was known inthe district as the "pitch-mannikin" who brought the first news thatthe freehold farm where Walpurga's mother had in her young days servedas a maid was for sale at a very low price for ready money. It was sixhours from the lake in the mountains--splendid soil fine forest
comment59,everything perfect. Hanse decided to have a look at it and Gruberseppwent with him to value it. The uncle's description was found to behighly coloured but after some bargaining the purchase was effectedand soon the news was bruited about the village that Hanse had paid "inclinking golden coin."The whole village with a brass band was assembled on the shore whenHanse and Walpurga with their family and worldly possessions embarkedto cross the lake on the first stage of their "flitting." All vexationswere forgotten in the hearty send-off and as the boat glided across thesilent lake it was followed by music cheering jodling and the boomingof mortars.They approached the opposite shore and Hanse pointed out the figure ofUncle Peter waiting for them with the cart and the furniture whenWalpurga suddenly ceased rowing and gave a startled cry."Heavens What's that I could swear when I was singing I thought ifonly my good Countess Irma could see us here together how happy shewould be. And just now it seemed to me as though----""Come on let's land" said Hanse.On the shore a figure in a fluttering garment was running up and down.It suddenly collapsed when the wind carried a full sound of music acrossthe lake. Then it rose again and vanished in the reeds."Have you seen nothing" asked Walpurga."Rather If it were not broad daylight and if it were not superstitionI should think it was the mermaid herself."The boat at last touched the shore. Walpurga was the first to jump out.She hurried to the reed-bank away from her people and there behindthe willows the apparition fell on her neck and broke down._IV.--The Countess Irma's Atonement_Dr. Gunther received the first telegraphic news of his friend CountEberhard having lost the power of speech through a stroke of paralysis.He was to break the news to Irma. For some time she had felt throughthe physician's reserve and sympathetic kindness that he could read hersecret. And now she realised that sudden knowledge of her disgrace alonecould have struck down her father whose vigorous constitution hadalways kept illness at arm's length.They arrived at the manor house before midnight and were shown into thesufferer's room. Count Eberhard's eyelids moved quickly when herecognised Dr. Gunther's voice and he tried to extend his hand towardshis friend but it fell heavily on the coverlet. Dr. Gunther seized itand held it in a firm grasp. Irma knelt down before the bed and herfather's trembling hand felt over her face and was wetted by her tears.Then he quickly withdrew it as though he had touched a poisonousanimal he turned away his face and pressed his forehead against thewall. Now he turned round again and with a gentle movement indicatedthat he wished her to leave the room.She was with him again next day. He tried painfully to say something toher to make her understand by signs--she could not understand. He bitupon his lips and tried to sit up. His face was changed--it assumed astrange colour a strange expression. Irma saw with a shudder what washappening. She knelt down and laid her cheek upon his hand. He withdrewthe hand. With supreme effort he wrote a word a short word with hisfinger upon her forhead. She saw she heard she read it--in the air onher forehead on her brain in her soul--she gave a scream and fellsenseless to the ground. Dr. Gunther entered quickly stepped over Irmaclosed his friend's eyes and all was silence.For many hours Irma was in her room shut in with her despair herremorse. No one could gain admission. She thought furiously she ravedand then fell into a troubled sleep. When she awake her resolution wasmade. She asked for light and writing material and wrote "My queen--
comment60,With death I atone for my guilt. Forgive and forget IRMA." On theenvelope she wrote "To be handed to the queen herself by Dr. Gunther."Then she took another sheet and wrote"My friend--For the last time I speak to you. We have goneastray--terribly. The atonement is mine. You belong to her and to thepeople. Your atonement is in life mine in death. Be calm be one withthe law that ties you to her and to the people. You have denied both andI have aided you. Be true again to yourself This is my dying word andI die willingly if you but listen. Listen to this voice and do notforget it But forget her who speaks to you. I will not be remembered."She sealed the letters left them in her writing-case and asked for herhorse to be saddled. She rode out followed by a groom whom somedistance from home she sent back on some pretext. When he was out ofsight she galloped off at full speed dismounted struck her horse withthe whip to make it run away and lost herself in the wood in thedirection of the lake._V.--A Court Scandal_Irma's torn boots were found on a rock by the lake her hat floating onthe waters. Although her body could not be recovered there was no doubtthat the countess had committed suicide. Her father's death must havebereft her of reason.When the news was first brought to the king he trembled violently andhad to seize the back of a chair for support. Then he requested to beleft alone and with dim eyes he read Irma's farewell message. On theimpulse of the moment he wanted to send the queen the last words of hisfriend he wanted to write under them to pour out his whole heart hiswhole repentance. He decided not to act hastily. Even the heaviest taskmust be fulfilled without loss of dignity. A chase had been arranged forthe morning. The hunting-party were waiting in the courtyard. With aneffort he pulled himself together descended with firm step and enteredhis carriage returning smilingly the salutations of his guests.The queen was scarcely less shaken by the terrible news which wasgently broken to her by Dr. Gunther. Her heart was filled with profoundpity for the unfortunate child and she gave vent to her grief in sobsand touching lamentations. Dr. Gunther tried to comfort her. "She is notgone without farewell. She has left this letter for your majesty--surelya letter that will bring balm in this terrible hour. Even to the lastshe proved her loving nature."
comment61,The queen seized the letter read it and turned deathly pale thenburning red. When she found words she exclaimed "And she has kissed mychild and he has kissed his child They talk of the sublime and theirwords do not cut their tongues Everything is soiled And he dared sayto me A prince has no private actions. His doings and his neglects setthe example Fie Everything is soiled everything filthy Everything"She became unconscious. Dr. Gunther sprinkled her forehead witheau-de-cologne and had her taken to bed. He sat by the bedside for sometime until she opened her eyes thanked him and expressed her desireto sleep. He spoke some soothing words and retired leavinginstructions with the lady of the bed-chamber in the ante-room.Some days passed before the king sought his wife's forgiveness. Theinterview was brief and decisive. The king spoke nobly manly andsincerely the queen was bitter sharp and irreconcilable. Her duty as aqueen demanded that the rift should not appear in public her injuredpride as a woman refused to admit more. He demanded to know whether herfriend and adviser Dr. Gunther knew of her decision. She replied hewas too noble to let thoughts of anger or revenge enter his great heart."This great being can be made small""You will not rob me of my only friend""Your only friend I do not know this title. To my knowledge there is nosuch office at court. Be what you will Be alone and seek for support inyourself."He stripped the wedding-ring from his hand placed it on the table andmoved towards the door. He hesitated a moment--will she call him backShe looked after him--will he turn around The moment passed. The doorclosed.In the evening a court was held and the queen appeared pale butsmiling on her husband's arm. They spoke confidentially and nobodynoticed the missing ring.Next day the journals announced that the king's physician had tenderedhis resignation.And court gossip had it that Walpurga had bought a farm with the goldshe had earned as intermediary between the king and the unfortunateCountess Wildenort._VI.--Forgiving and Forgiven_Irma had passed four years at Hanse's mountain farm. Her secret had
comment62,been well kept. Even Hanse who had promised his wife never to ask anyquestions about their permanent guest was in complete ignorance abouther identity. Irma who after having tried her hand at various domesticoccupations had taken up wood-carving with considerable successenabling her to discharge at least the material part of her debt ofgratitude was generally held to be a half-witted relation ofWalpurga's.Her despair and remorse had gradually given way to resigned sadness.Self-communion had to make up for lack of intellectual intercourse andsharpened her perception. In her diary she entered the profound thoughtssuggested to her active intelligence by her observation of events inthemselves insignificant and analysed with cool aloofness the workingof her mind. She never entertained the thought of finding a refuge inthe convent--her atonement was to be wrought not by compulsion but byfree will. And so the weeks passed and the months and the years.They had all helped in the building of a wooden cowherd's hut on theheight of the mountain a few hours' climb from the farm. Now Irma feltthe need for more complete solitude away even from her simple friends.Up there on the height she would find peace and complete heratonement. And so it was decided to let her have her way and to let herstay in the hut with Peter and his daughter.The first two days and nights a cloud lingered around them forming aveil of dense fog but on the third day Irma was awakened by the sun andstepped out to see the awakening of nature. The grandeur the immensityof it all the pure-scented air the voices of the birds filled herheart with gladness. A sunray struck her forehead--the forehead waspure she felt it.Irma now gave up her wood-carving she had to be urged to eat and onlytook her food to please the kind old "pitch-mannikin." Immovably shewould lie for hours in her favorite meadow and think and breathe thepure air. Her life was slowly ebbing from her. A sudden vision of theking with his companions of the chase galloping past her in pursuit of astag gave her the final shock. She cowered on the ground. She bit intothe moss scraped the earth with her hands--she feared to scream aloud.She staggered back to the hut shaken by fever and threw herself uponher bed. Then she asked Peter for some paper. She had heard that Dr.
comment63,Gunther was living with his family at the summer resort at the foot ofthe mountain. She wrote with shaking hand "Eberhard's daughter callsDr. Gunther" and sent Peter to speed down with the message.In the little town all was excitement and commotion owing to the sojournof the royal court. Dr. Gunther now in favour again was with the kingwhen the message arrived. He read the note and was left speechless withamazement. Then he collected his wits and hurried with Peter to thedying penitent's bedside. Irma was sleeping and he sat by her sideuntil she awoke. She saw Gunther--pleasure illumined her face and sheheld out both hands towards him. He took them and she pressed herfeverish lips upon his hands.Walpurga to whom the news of Irma's impending end had been broughttook a quick resolution. She hurried to the little town to seek herqueen. The matter was not easy for suspicion rested heavily upon herbut her determination removed all obstacles and the queen profoundlymoved by Walpurga's jerky explanation and passionate appeal and stirredto the very depths of her soul by Irma's heroism demanded to be led atonce to her. She was followed in a short while by the king to whom thewhole incident had been reported.Gunther sat for hours by Irma's bedside listening to her heavybreathing. The door flew open and the queen appeared."At last you have come" breathed Irma raising herself and kneeling inher bed. Then with a heart-breaking voice she exclaimed "Forgiveforgive""Forgive me Irma my sister" sobbed the queen and took her in herarms and kissed her. A smile spread over Irma's face then with a cry ofpain she fell back dead.When the king arrived he found his wife kneeling before the bed. Hequietly knelt down by her side. The queen arose placed her hand uponhis head. "Kurt" she said "forgive me as I have forgiven you." Thenshe spread a white kerchief over the dead and they left the hut. Theywalked hand in hand through the wood until they reached the road wherecarriages were waiting.During the night the "pitch-mannikin" dug a grave on the spot where Irmahad loved to lie in the sun. She was buried there early next morning.Hanse and Peter and Dr. Gunther carried the corpse and Walpurga withher child formed the procession.                                   JANE AUSTENSense and Sensibility     Jane Austen daughter of the rector of Steventon in North     Hampshire England was born there on December 16 1775 and     received her education from her father a former Fellow of St.     John's College Oxford. Her life was spent in the country or     in country towns chiefly at the village of Chawton near     Winchester. She died unmarried at Winchester on July 18     1817 and was buried in the cathedral. The novels of Jane     Austen may be divided into two groups. The first three--"Sense     and Sensibility" "Pride and Prejudice" and "Northanger     Abbey"--were all written in first draft at any rate between     1792 and 1798. These are the novels composed during the     author's residence at Steventon which she left in 1801. There     succeeded an interval of practically fourteen years     1798-1812 during which time the novelist let her mind lie     absolutely fallow. As a natural consequence of the
comment64,     comparatively secluded life which Jane Austen led the society     with which she deals in her novels is a rather restricted one.     It is the world of the country gentleman and of the upper     professional class. From a very early age Jane Austen had a     taste for writing tales and the first draft of "Sense and     Sensibility "--then called "Elinor and Marianne"--was composed     as early as 1792. The book was recast under its present title     between 1797 and 1798 and again revised prior to its     publication in 1811. In addition to the six novels on which     her fame is based--all of which were issued anonymously--Jane     Austen has to her credit some agreeable "Letters" a fragment     of a story called "The Watsons" and a sort of novelette which     bears the name of "Lady Susan."_I.--The Dashwoods of Norland Park_Mr. Henry Dashwood of Norland Park Sussex died leaving his widow andhis three daughters Elinor Marianne and Margaret to the generosity ofMr. John Dashwood his son by his first wife and the heir to his estate.Mr. John who apart from the family inheritance had received onefortune from his mother and another with his wife was at first disposedto increase the portions of his sisters by giving them a thousand poundsapiece but under the persuasion of his wife he finally resolved that itwould be absolutely unnecessary if not highly indecorous to do morefor his father's widow and children than such kind of neighbourly actsas looking out for a comfortable small house for them helping them toremove their things and sending them presents of fish and game wheneverthey were in season.Taking account of this resolve as expressed in Mr. John Dashwood'sfrequent talk of the increasing expenses of housekeeping and of theperpetual demands made upon his purse and exasperated too by themanifest disapprobation with which Mrs. John Dashwood looked upon thegrowing attachment between her own brother Edward Ferrars and ElinorMrs. Henry Dashwood and her daughters left their old home with someabruptness and went to live in Devonshire where their old friend SirJohn Middleton of Barton Park had provided them with a cottage closeto his own place.Elinor the eldest of the daughters possessed a strength of
comment65,understanding and coolness of judgment which qualified her though onlynineteen to be the counsellor of her mother and enabled her frequentlyto counteract to the advantage of them all that eagerness of mind inMrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence. She had anexcellent heart. Her disposition was affectionate and her feelings werestrong but she knew how to govern them. It was a knowledge which hermother had yet to learn and which one of her sisters had resolved neverto be taught. Marianne's abilities were in many respects quite equalto Elinor's. She was sensible and clever but eager in everything hersorrows her joys could have no moderation. She was generous amiableinteresting she was everything but prudent. The resemblance between herand her mother was strikingly great and her excess of sensibilitywhich Elinor saw with concern was by Mrs. Dashwood valued andcherished.Margaret the other sister was good-humoured but she had alreadyimbibed a good deal of Marianne's romance without having much of hersense and at thirteen she did not bid fair to equal her sisters at amore advanced period of life.But whatever the virtues or failings of the Dashwood ladies theirsociety was very welcome at Barton Park. Sir John Middleton was agood-looking man about forty thoroughly good-humoured in manner andcountenance friendly and kind-hearted in disposition who delighted incollecting about him more young people than his house would hold.Lady Middleton was a handsome woman of six-and-twenty well-bred andgraceful in address but deficient in frankness warmth or anything tosay for herself. She piqued herself upon the elegance of her tableappointments and of all her domestic arrangements and this kind ofvanity it was that constituted her greatest enjoyment in any of theirparties. Sir John was a sportsman Lady Middleton a mother. He huntedand shot and she humoured her children and these were their onlyresources. Continual engagements at home and abroad however suppliedall the deficiencies of nature and education--supported the good spiritsof Sir John and gave exercise to the good-breeding of his wife.Mrs. Jennings Lady Middleton's mother who formed one of the party onthe first occasion of the Dashwoods dining at Barton Park was agood-humoured fat elderly woman who talked a good deal and seemedvery happy and rather vulgar. She was full of jokes and laughter andbefore dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject oflovers and husbands hoped they had not left their hearts behind them inSussex and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not. Infact this lady was a born match-maker and she at once proceeded byhints here and raillery there to promote a match between Marianne agedseventeen and Colonel Brandon a grave but sensible bachelor on thewrong side of thirty-five. Marianne however scorned and laughed at theidea being reasonable enough to allow that a man of five-and-thirtymight well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisitepower of enjoyment and having met with an accident which led to herbeing carried home by a handsome and vivacious young gentleman calledWilloughby who had a seat called Combe Magna in Somersetshire sherapidly developed a liking for his society and as quickly discoveredthat in regard to music to dancing and to books their tastes werestrikingly alike."Well Marianne" said Elinor after his first visit "for one morning Ithink you have done pretty well. You have already ascertained Mr.Willoughby's opinion in almost every matter of importance. You know whatto think of Cowper and Scott you are aware of his estimating their
comment66,beauties as he ought and you have received every assurance of hisadmiring Pope no more than is proper. But how is your acquaintance to belong supported under such extraordinary dispatch of every subject fordiscourse You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic. Anothermeeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty andsecond marriages and then you can have nothing further to ask."To this Marianne replied "Is this fair Is this just Are my ideas soscanty But I see what you mean. I have been too much at my ease--toohappy too frank. I have erred against every commonplace notion ofdecorum. I have been open and sincere where I ought to have beenreserved spiritless dull and deceitful. Had I talked only of theweather and the roads and had I spoken only once in ten minutes thisreproach would have been spared."From which it will be gathered that Marianne began now to perceive thatthat desperation which had seized her at sixteen-and-a-half of everseeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection had been somewhatrash and quite unjustifiable._II.--Marianne Dashwood in Love_Willoughby's society soon became Marianne's most exquisite enjoyment.The mutual attachment was obvious--amusingly obvious. They read theytalked they sang they danced they drove together and they evenagreed in depreciating Colonel Brandon as "the kind of man whomeverybody spoke well of and nobody cared about whom all were delightedto see and nobody remembered to talk to." Then after cutting off alock of Marianne's hair after offering her a horse and after showingher over the house which would eventually be his on the death of Mrs.Smith the elderly relative on whom he was partially dependent theyoung lover suddenly took leave of the family having said not a word toMrs. Dashwood of an engagement and having offered no other explanationof his hasty departure than the flimsy pretext of being sent by hisrelative on business to London.Willoughby left for London a few days after Colonel Brandon had alsobeen unexpectedly summoned to the same place and he expressed no hopeof any rapid return into Devonshire. On such an occasion Marianne wouldhave thought herself very inexcusable had she not given way to all herfeelings and for some days she courted misery and indulged in tears insolitude and in sleeplessness. But she was soon set a better example byElinor who did her utmost to remain cheerful under the depression ofheart caused by a visit paid to the family about this same time byEdward Ferrars. He was obviously uneasy low-spirited and reserved saidhe had already been a fortnight in Devonshire stopping with some friendsat Plymouth and after a week's stay with the Dashwoods left them inspite of their wishes and his own and without any restraint on his
comment67,time. But Elinor and Marianne were not long allowed leisure to bemiserable. Sir John's and Mrs. Jennings' active zeal in the cause ofsociety soon procured them some other new acquaintance to see andobserve. One of these couples was Lady Middleton's brother-in-law andyounger sister Mr. and Mrs. Palmer. It was impossible for anyone to bemore thoroughly good-natured or more determined to be happy than Mrs.Palmer. The studied indifference insolence and discontent of herhusband gave her no pain and when he scolded or abused her she washighly diverted. "Mr. Palmer is so droll" she used to say in a whisperto Elinor "he is always out of humour." One day at dinner his wifesaid to him with her usual laugh "My love you contradict everybody.Do you know that you are quite rude" To which he replied "I did notknow I contradicted anybody in calling your mother ill-bred." But thegood-natured old lady was in no wise affronted "Ay you may abuse me asmuch as you please" she said. "You have taken Charlotte off my handsand cannot give her back again. So there I have the whip-hand of you."The other couple of new friends whom Sir John's reluctance to keep evena third cousin to himself provided for them were the Misses Steele. In amorning's excursion to Exeter Sir John and Mrs. Jennings had met withtwo young ladies whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discoveringto be her relations and this was enough for Sir John to invite themdirectly to the Park as soon as their engagements at Exeter were over.The result was that Elinor and Marianne were almost forced into anintercourse with two young women who however civil they might be wereobviously underbred. Miss Steele was a plain girl about thirty whosewhole conversation was of beaux while Miss Lucy Steele a pretty girlof twenty-three was despite her native cleverness probably common andilliterate.Marianne however who had never much toleration for anything likeimpertinence vulgarity inferiority of parts or even difference oftaste from herself soon checked every endeavour at intimacy on theirside by the coldness of her behaviour towards them but Elinor frompoliteness submitted to the attentions of both but especially to thoseof Lucy who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation orof striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frankcommunication of her sentiments until one day as they were walkingtogether from the Park to the cottage she asked Elinor if she werepersonally acquainted with Mrs. John Dashwood's mother Mrs. Ferrarsand in explanation of her question proceeded to confound her byconfessing that she knew Mr. Edward Ferrars who had been at one timeunder the care of her uncle Mr. Pratt at Longstaple near Plymouthand that she had been engaged to him for the last four years.Distressed by this news which she was quite aware that Lucy had
comment68,confided to her merely from jealousy and suspicion indignant atEdward's duplicity though convinced of his genuine attachment toherself Elinor resolved not to give pain to her mother and sister bytelling them of the engagement. Indeed her attention was soon withdrawnfrom her own to her sister's love affairs by an invitation which Mrs.Jennings gave the two girls to spend a few weeks with her in town at herhouse near Portman Square an invitation which was accepted by Mariannein the hope of seeing Willoughby and by Elinor with the intention oflooking after Marianne. Mrs. Jennings' party was three days on the roadand arrived in Berkeley Street at three o'clock in the afternoon intime to allow Marianne to write a brief note to Willoughby. But hefailed to appear that evening and when a loud knock at the doorresulted in Colonel Brandon being admitted instead she found the shockof disappointment too great to be borne with calmness and left theroom.As it happened a full week elapsed before she discovered by findinghis card on the table that her lover had arrived in town. Even then shecould not see him. He failed to call the next morning and thoughinvited to dine on the following day with the Middletons in ConduitStreet he neglected to put in an appearance. Which strange conductmoved Marianne to send another note to him and Elinor to write to hermother entreating her to demand from Marianne an account of her realsituation with respect to him.A meeting between Marianne Dashwood and John Willoughby at last tookplace at a fashionable party where the latter greeted the two sisterswith great coldness and reluctance and a third letter from Mariannenow frantic with grief elicited a reply from him in which he announcedhis engagement to another lady "reproached himself for not having beenmore guarded in his professions of esteem for Marianne and returnedwith great regret the lock of her hair which she had so obliginglybestowed on him."A day or two later Colonel Brandon called on Elinor to give her certaininformation about Willoughby. He told her that his sudden departure fromDevonshire to London which had surprised his friends so much had beendue to an affecting letter he had received from his ward Miss Williamsthe natural daughter of a beloved sister-in-law. Willoughby had met thislady--a pretty girl of sixteen--at Bath and after a guilty intimacyhad abandoned her. Colonel Brandon had gone to her rescue and to fight abloodless duel with her betrayer._III.--Matrimonial Intrigues_One day Elinor and Marianne were at Gray's in Sackville Streetcarrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewelsbelonging to their mother when they came upon their half-brother Mr.John Dashwood. He paid a visit to Mrs. Jennings the next day and camewith a pretence of an apology for his wife not coming too. To hissisters his manners though calm were perfectly kind to Mrs. Jenningsmost attentively civil and on Colonel Brandon coming in soon afterhimself he eyed him with a curiosity that seemed to say that he onlywanted to know him to be rich to be equally civil to _him_. Afterstaying with them half an hour he asked Elinor to walk with him toConduit Street and to introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton andas soon as they were out of the house he began to make inquiries aboutColonel Brandon. Which inquiries having elicited the satisfactoryinformation that the gentleman had a good property at Delaford Park inDorsetshire Mr. Dashwood--indifferent to his sister's disclaimers--proceeded to congratulate her on the prospect of a very respectableestablishment in life to insist that the objections to a priorattachment on her side were not insurmountable and to inform herthat the object of that attachment--Mr. Edward Ferrars--was likely to bemarried to Miss Morton a peer's daughter with thirty thousand poundsof her own.Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband's judgment thatshe waited the very next day on both Mrs. Jennings and her daughter. Shefound the former by no means unworthy her notice and the latter one of
comment69,the most charming women in the world. The attraction was mutual forLady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood.There was a kind of cold-hearted selfishness on both sides whichmutually attracted them and they sympathised with each other in aninsipid propriety of demeanour and a general want of understanding.Indeed the Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletonsthat though not much in the habit of giving anything they determinedto give them a dinner and soon after their acquaintance began invitedthem to dine at Harley Street where they had taken a very good housefor three months. Mrs. Jennings and the Misses Dashwood were invitedlikewise and so were Colonel Brandon as a friend of the young ladiesand the Misses Steele as belonging to the Middleton party in ConduitStreet. They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars.Mrs. Ferrars turned out to be a little thin woman upright even toformality in her figure and serious even to sourness in her aspect. Hercomplexion was sallow and her features small without beauty andnaturally without expression but a lucky contraction of the brow hadrescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity by giving it thestrong characters of pride and ill-nature. She was not a woman of manywords for unlike people in general she proportioned them to thenumber of her ideas of the few syllables which did escape her not onefell to the share of Miss Dashwood whom she eyed with the spiriteddetermination of disliking her at all events whereas towards the MissesSteele--particularly towards Lucy--both mother and daughter wereostentatiously gracious. On this occasion Marianne created something ofa scene by openly resenting this treatment of her sister while Mr.Dashwood seeking to interest Colonel Brandon in Elinor showed him apretty pair of screens which she had painted for his wife and informedhim that "a few months ago Marianne _was_ remarkably handsome quite ashandsome as Elinor."The next morning Lucy called on Elinor to exult in Mrs. Ferrars'flattering treatment of her her joy however was somewhat diminishedby the unexpected appearance of Edward Ferrars in Berkeley Street forthough both Elinor and Lucy were able to keep up their respective posestowards him Marianne confused all three by an open demonstration of hersisterly affection for him. But an invitation from Mrs. John Dashwood tothe Misses Steele to spend some days in Harley Street soon restoredLucy's equanimity and almost made Elinor believe that her rival was areal favourite.At any rate this was the view taken by foolish Nancy Steele."Lord" thought she to herself "they are all so fond of Lucy to besure they will make no difficulty about it." And so away she went andtold Mrs. Dashwood all about Lucy's engagement to Edward Ferrars theresult of which was that the married lady fell into hysterics while theMisses Steele were hastily bundled out of the house.Elinor on hearing this news from Mrs. Jennings soon saw the necessityof preparing Marianne for its discussion. She lost no time thereforein making her acquainted with the real truth and in endeavouring tobring her to hear it talked of by others without betraying that shefelt any uneasiness for her sister or any resentment towards Edward. Atfirst Marianne wept in grief and amazement then she began to ascribeElinor's long reticence about the engagement to lack of real depth offeeling and it was not till the latter had done a deal of protestingthat the younger girl was able to give her sister due credit forself-sacrifice and generosity. So when Mr. John Dashwood came round tohis sisters to tell them how Edward had refused to break off hisengagement and how Mrs. Ferrars on hearing of this had resolved tocut him off with a shilling and to do all in her power to prevent hisadvancing in any profession and had settled on his brother Robert anestate of a thousand pounds which she had intended to bestow on himMarianne let her indignation burst forth only when her brother hadquitted the room. A few days later Elinor met Nancy Steele inKensington Gardens who gave her a certain information which
comment70,subsequently turned out to have been derived from listening at thekeyhole. This was to the effect that Edward out of consideration forLucy who would be marrying a man with no prospects and with no meanssave two thousand pounds had offered to give her up but that Lucy hadprotested her affection for him was determined not to give him up andwas building hopes on his taking orders and getting a living.Fortunately the much desired living came far sooner than Lucy couldhave expected for Colonel Brandon with characteristic kindnessoffered the presentation of the rectory of Delaford to Edward throughElinor._IV--A Happy Ending to Love's Troubles_Anxious though the Misses Dashwood were to get back to Barton theycould not refuse an invitation from the Palmers to spend a few days withthem. But thanks to the romantic folly of Marianne--who because shefancied she could see Combe Magna Willoughby's place from Clevelandmust needs take two evening walks in the grounds just where the grasswas the longest and the wettest--the house-party enjoyed not thepleasantest of times. Marianne had to take to bed and became sofeverish and delirious that Colonel Brandon volunteered to fetch Mrs.Dashwood himself.The next evening Elinor who was acting as her sister's most devotednurse and was hourly expecting her mother's arrival was astounded by avisit from Willoughby who having met Sir John Middleton in the lobbyof Drury Lane Theatre the previous night and thus heard of Marianne'sserious illness had set forth post-haste to make inquiries and was nowdelighted to find her out of danger. Attempting an exculpation ofhimself he confessed that at first meeting Marianne he had tried toengage her regard without a thought of returning it that afterwards hegrew sincerely fond of her but put off from day to day paying her hisformal addresses and that just at the moment when he was going to make aregular proposal to her Mrs. Smith's discovery of his liaison with MissWilliams and his refusal to right matters by marrying the young ladydismissed him from his relative's house and favour prevented him fromdeclaring his love to Marianne and in the embarrassed state of hisfinances seemed to render marriage with a wealthy woman his only chanceof salvation. He repudiated the charge of having deserted Miss Williamsdeclaring that he did not know the straits to which she had beenreduced. He also alluded to the violence of her passion and theweakness of her understanding as some excuses for the apparentheartlessness of his own conduct.He then went on to explain his treatment of Marianne's letters how hehad already--previous to the arrival of the Dashwoods in town--becomeengaged to Miss Sophia Grey how with his head and heart full ofMarianne he was forced to play the happy lover to Sophia and howSophia in her jealousy had opened Marianne's third letter and dictatedthe reply."What do you think of my wife's style of letter-writing Delicatetender fully feminine was it not" said he."You are very wrong Mr. Willoughby" said Elinor. "You ought not tospeak in this way either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister. You have madeyour own choice. It was not forced on you. Your wife has a claim to yourpoliteness--to your respect at least." She must be attached to you orshe would not have married you.""Do not talk to me of my wife" said he with a heavy sigh. "She doesnot deserve your compassion. She knew I had no regard for her when wemarried. And now do you pity me Miss Dashwood Have I explained awayany part of my guilt""Yes. You have certainly removed something--a little" said Elinor. "Youhave proved yourself on the whole less faulty than I had believedyou."When Mrs. Dashwood arrived at Cleveland Elinor at once gave her thejoyful news of Marianne's material improvement in health and after anaffectionate but nearly silent interview had taken place between motherand sick child the former proceeded to express to Elinor her admirationfor Colonel Brandon's disposition and manners and her expectation thathe and Marianne would make a match of it. The Colonel it seemed had
comment71,told Mrs. Dashwood on the way of his affection for her daughter.Marianne however at first seemed to have other plans. When the familygot back to Barton Cottage she announced that she had determined toenter on a course of serious study and to devote six hours a day toimproving herself by reading. But with such a confederacy against her asthat formed by her mother and Elinor--with a knowledge so intimate ofColonel Brandon's goodness--what could she doAs for Elinor her self-control was at last rewarded thanks to astrange _volte-face_ on the part of Lucy Steele who finding that_Robert_ Ferrars had the money married him and jilted his brother. Theway was thus cleared to Elinor's union with Edward whose mother wasinduced to give the young couple her consent and a marriage portion of10000.                                   Pride and Prejudice     This Jane Austen's best-known novel was written between 1796     and 1797 and was called "First Impressions." Revised in 1811     it was published two years later by the same Mr. Egerton of     the Military Library Whitehall who had brought out "Sense     and Sensibility." Like its predecessor and like "Northanger     Abbey" it was written at Steventon Rectory and it is     generally regarded not only as its author's most popular but     as her most representative achievement. Wickham the     all-conquering young lady-killer of the story is a favourite     character of the novelist He figures as Willoughby in "Sense     and Sensibility" as Crawford in "Mansfield Park" as     Churchill in "Emma" and--to a certain extent--as Wentworth in     "Persuasion." Another characteristic feature of "Pride and     Prejudice" is Wickham's unprepared attachment to Lydia Bennet     resembling as it does Robert Ferrars' startling engagement to     Lucy Steele in "Sense and Sensibility" Frank Churchill's     secret understanding with Jane Fairfax in "Emma" and Captain     Benwick's sudden and unexpected union with Louisa Musgrove in     "Persuasion."_I.--A Society Ball at Longbourn_All Longbourn was agape with excitement when it became known thatNetherfield Park the great place of the neighbourhood was let to arich and handsome young bachelor called Bingley and that Mr. Bingleyand his party were to attend the forthcoming ball at the Assembly Rooms.Nowhere did the news create more interest and rouse greater hopes thanin the household of the Bennets the chief inhabitants of Longbourn forMr. Bennet--who was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour
comment72,reserve and caprice that the experience of three-and-twenty years hadbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character--was thefather of five unmarried daughters while Mrs. Bennet--a still handsomewoman of mean understanding little information and uncertaintemper--made the business of her life getting her daughters married andits solace visiting and news.The evening fixed for the ball came round at last and when theNetherfield party entered the Assembly Rooms it was found to consist offive persons altogether--Mr. Bingley his two sisters the husband ofthe elder and another young man.Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentleman-like he had a pleasantcountenance and easy unaffected manners. His sisters were fine womenwith an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law Mr. Hurst merelylooked the gentleman but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attentionof the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien andthe report which was in general circulation within five minutes afterhis entrance of his having ten thousand a year. He was looked at withgreat admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave adisgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was found to beproud to be above his company and above being pleased.Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principalpeople in the room. He was lively and unreserved danced every dancewas angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving onehimself at Netherfield. What a contrast between him and his friend Mr.Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley anddeclined being introduced to any other lady.It so happened that Elizabeth the second eldest of the Bennet girlshad been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for twodances and during part of that time Mr. Darcy had been standing nearenough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingleywho came from the dance for a few minutes."Come Darcy" said he "I must have you dance. I hate to see youstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much betterdance.""I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it unless I amparticularly acquainted with my partner" At such an assembly as this itwould be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged and there is not
comment73,another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me tostand up with.""I would not be so fastidious as you are" cried Bingley "for akingdom Upon my honour I never met with so many pleasant girls in mylife as I have this evening and there are several of them you seeuncommonly pretty.""_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room" said Mr.Darcy looking at the eldest Miss Bennet."Oh she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld But there is oneof her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and Idare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.""Which do you mean" And turning round he looked for a moment atElizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said"She is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt _me_ and I am in nohumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slightedby other men You had better return to your partner and enjoy hersmiles for you are wasting your time with me."Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off and Elizabethremained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the storyhowever with great spirit among her friends for she had a livelyplayful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous._II--The Bennet Girls and their Lovers_Despite its rather unpromising commencement the course of a few daysplaced the acquaintance of the Bennets with the Bingleys on a footingapproaching friendship and soon matters began to stand somewhat asfollow. It was obvious that Charles Bingley and Jane Bennet weremutually attracted and this despite the latter's outward composurewhich like her amiability of manner and charity of view was apt tomislead the superficial observer. On the other hand while the Bingleyladies expressed themselves as willing to know the two elder MissBennets and pronounced Jane "a sweet girl" they found the other femalesof the family impossible. Mrs. Bennet was intolerably stupid andtedious Mary who being the only plain member of her family piquedherself on the extent of her reading and the solidity of herreflections was a platitudinous moralist while Lydia and Kitty wereloud silly giggling girls who spent all their time in running aftermen. As for Mr. Darcy the indifference he at first felt to ElizabethBennet was gradually converted into a sort of guarded interest.Originally he had scarcely allowed her to be pretty but now he admiredthe beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeededsome others equally mortifying. Though he had detected more than onefailure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledgeher figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting thather manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught bytheir easy playfulness. He began to wish to know more of her and as astep towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversationwith others while since both he and she were of a satirical turn theysoon began to exchange little rallying challenging speeches so thatCaroline Bingley who was openly angling for Darcy herself said to himone night "How long has Miss Elizabeth Bennet been such a favouriteAnd pray when am I to wish you joy" To which remarks he merely replied"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's
comment74,imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from loveto matrimony in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy."Meantime the friendship subsisting between the two families wasadvanced by a visit of some days paid by the two Bennet sisters to theBingleys at whose house Jane thanks to her mother's scheming was laidup with a bad cold. On this occasion Jane was coddled and made much ofby her dear friends Caroline and Mrs. Hurst but Elizabeth was nowreckoned too attractive by one sister and condemned as toosharp-tongued by both."Eliza Bennet" said Miss Bingley when the door was closed on her "isone of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the othersex by undervaluing their own and with many men I dare say itsucceeds. But in my opinion it is a very mean art.""Undoubtedly" replied Darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescendto employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning isdespicable."Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as tocontinue the subject.Nevertheless Darcy's growing attachment to Eliza was little dreamt ofby that young lady. Indeed her prejudice against him was strengthenedby her pleasant intercourse with a handsome and agreeable young mancalled Wickham an officer of the militia regiment quartered at Merytonthe nearest town to Longbourn. He told her how he was the son of atrusted steward of Darcy's father and had been left by the oldgentleman to his heir's liberality and care and how Darcy hadabsolutely disregarded his father's wishes and had treated his protgin cruel and unfeeling fashion.On the top of this disclosure and just at it seemed certain thatBingley was on the point of proposing to Jane the whole Netherfieldparty suddenly abandoned Hertfordshire and returned to town partly asElizabeth could not help thinking in consequence of the behaviour ofher family at a ball given at Netherfield Park where it appeared to herthat had they made an agreement to expose themselves as much as theycould during the evening they could not have played their parts withmore spirit or finer success._III.--Elizabeth Rejects the Rector_About this time the Rev. Mr. Collins heir-presumptive to Longbourncame on a visit to the Bennets. He was a tall heavy-looking young manof five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately and his manners werevery formal. He was a strange mixture of pomposity servility andself-importance a creature most abjectly yet most amusingly devoid ofanything like tact taste or humour.Being ready to make the Bennet girls every possible amends for theunwilling injury he must eventually do them he thought first of all ofoffering himself to Jane but hearing that her affections werepre-engaged he had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth. It was soondone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. His proposal he madeto the younger lady in a long set speech in which he explained first
comment75,of all his general reasons for marrying and then his reasons fordirecting his matrimonial views to Longbourn finally assuring her thaton the subject of the small portion she would bring him no ungenerousreproach should ever pass his lips when they were married.It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him then so Elizabeth told himhe was too hasty thanked him for his proposals and declined them."I am not now to learn" replied Mr. Collins with a formal wave of thehand "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of theman whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for theirfavour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even athird time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you havesaid and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.""Upon my word sir" cried Elizabeth "your hope is rather anextraordinary one after my declaration I do assure you that I am notone of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are sodaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a secondtime. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_happy and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world whowould make _you_ so. Nay were your friend Lady Catherine to know meI am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for thesituation.""Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so----" said Mr.Collins very gravely. "But I cannot imagine that her ladyship would atall disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have thehonour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of yourmodesty economy and other amiable qualifications."Twice more was Mr. Collins refused and even then he would not take "No"for an answer."You must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin" said he"that your refusals of my addresses are merely words of course. Myreasons for believing it are chiefly these. It does not appear to methat my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment Ican offer would be any other than highly desirable. My situation inlife my connections with the family of De Bourgh and my relationshipto your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should takeit into further consideration that in spite of your manifoldattractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriagemay ever be made to you. Your portion is unhappily so small that itwill in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiablequalifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not seriousin your rejection of me I shall choose to attribute it to your wish ofincreasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice ofelegant females.""I do assure you sir" said Elizabeth "that I have no pretensionswhatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting arespectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believedsincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me inyour proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelingsin every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer Do not consider me nowas an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creaturespeaking the truth from her heart.""You are uniformly charming" said he with an air of awkward gallantry"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority ofboth your excellent parents my proposals will be acceptable."_IV.--Darcy Loves and Loses_Rejected by Elizabeth to the great satisfaction of her father and tothe great indignation of her mother the rector of Hunsford lost no time
comment76,in betaking himself to Elizabeth's dearest friend Charlotte Lucas whobeing a girl with unromantic not to say prosaic views of marriagereadily accepted and married him thereby moving to further disgust andanger poor Mrs. Bennet who was already wondering and repining at Mr.Bingley's returning no more into Hertfordshire. Jane suffered insilence and despite Elizabeth's efforts to point out the duplicity ofCaroline Bingley was inclined to believe the protestations that thelatter made in her letters from London of Bingley's growing attachmentto Darcy's sister Georgiana.Mr. Bennet treated the matter in his customary ironical way."So Lizzy" said he one day "your sister is crossed in love I find.I congratulate her. Next to being married a girl likes to be crossed inlove a little now and then. It is something to think of and gives her asort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn to come Youwill hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here areofficers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in thecountry. Let Wickham be your man. He is a pleasant fellow and wouldjilt you creditably.""Thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must notall expect Jane's good fortune.""True" said Mr. Bennet "but it is a comfort to think that whatever ofthat kind may befall you you have a mother who will always make themost of it."As it turned out Wickham though he had not arrived at an intimacywhich enabled him to _jilt_ Elizabeth yet most certainly transferredhis attentions very shortly from her to a Miss King who by the deathof her grandfather had come into 10000. Elizabeth however was quiteheartwhole and she and her former admirer parted on friendly terms whenshe left Longbourn to pay her promised visit to Mr. and Mrs. Collins atHunsford.There she found Charlotte managing her home and her husband withconsiderable discretion and as the rectory adjoined Rosings Park theseat of Lady Catherine de Bourgh the patroness of the living she wasintroduced to that lady in whom she could discover nothing but aninsolent aristocratic woman who dictated to everyone about her meddledin everybody's business aimed at marrying her sickly daughter to Darcyand was needless to say slavishly adored by Mr. Collins.In the third week of her visit Mr. Darcy and his cousin ColonelFitzwilliam came down to see their aunt and thus--to Elizabeth'sindifference--an acquaintance was renewed which Darcy soon seemed to
comment77,show a real desire to take up again. He sought her society at RosingsPark he called familiarly at the rectory he waylaid her in herfavourite walk and all the time in all his intercourse with her herevealed such a mixture of interest and constraint as demonstrated onlytoo clearly that some internal struggle was going on within him.Mrs. Collins began to hope for her friend but Elizabeth who hadreceived from Colonel Fitzwilliam ample confirmation of her suspicionthat it was Darcy who had persuaded Bingley to give up Jane was nowonly more incensed against the man who had broken her sister's peace ofmind.On the very evening of the day on which she had extracted this piece ofinformation from his cousin Darcy knowing her to be alone called atthe rectory and after a silence of several minutes came towards herin an agitated manner."In vain have I struggled" he said. "It will not do. My feelings willnot be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admireand love you."Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared coloureddoubted and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragementand the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for herimmediately followed. He spoke well but there were feelings besidesthose of the heart to be detailed. His sense of her inferiority ofmarriage with her being a degradation of the family obstacles whichjudgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmthwhich seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was veryunlikely to recommend his suit. In truth it was already lost forthough Elizabeth could not be insensible to the compliment of such aman's affection her intentions did not vary for an instant. Accusinghim of having ruined perhaps for ever the happiness of her sisterJane and of having blighted the career of his former friend Wickhamshe reproached him with the uncivil style of his declaration and gavehim her answer in the words"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible waythat would have tempted me to accept it."Soon after Darcy took his leave but the next day he accosted Elizabethin the park and handed her a letter which he begged her to read. Sheread it and had the mortification to discover not only that Darcy madesome scathing but perfectly justifiable comments on the objectionablemembers of her family but that he was able to clear himself of both thecharges she had brought against him. He maintained that in separatingBingley from Jane he had not the slightest notion that he was doing thelatter any injury since he never credited her with any strongattachment to his friend and he assured Elizabeth that though Wickham
comment78,had always been an idle and dissipated person he had more thanfulfilled his father's intentions to him and that Wickham had repaidhim for his generosity by trying to elope with his young sisterGeorgiana a girl of fifteen.When Elizabeth returned to Longbourn she found it a relief to tell Janeof Darcy's proposal and of his revelation of Wickham's real characterbut she thought it best to suppress every particular of the letter inwhich Jane herself was concerned._V.--An Elopement_Some two months later Elizabeth went on a tour in Derbyshire with hermaternal uncle and aunt Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. The latter had lived forsome years at a town called Lambton and wished to revisit her oldfriends there and as Pemberley--Mr. Darcy's seat--was only five milesoff and was a show-place the Gardiners determined to see it thoughtheir niece was reluctant to accompany them until she had learned thatits owner was not at home. As they were being shown over the placeElizabeth could not help reflecting that she might have been mistress ofit and she listened with surprise as the old housekeeper told them thatshe should never meet with a better master that she had never had across word from him in her life that as a child he was always thesweetest-tempered most generous-hearted boy in the world and thatthere was not one of his tenants or servants but would testify to hisexcellent qualities as a landlord and a master.As they were walking across the lawn the owner of Pemberley himselfsuddenly came forward from the road and as if to justify the praises ofhis housekeeper and to show that he had taken to heart Elizabeth'sformer complaints of his behaviour proceeded to treat the Gardinerparty with the greatest civility and even cordiality. He introduced hissister to them asked them to dinner invited Mr. Gardiner to fish atPemberley as often as he chose and in answer to a spiteful remark ofMiss Bingley's to the effect that he had thought Elizabeth pretty at onetime made the crushing reply"Yes but that was only when I first knew her for it is many monthssince I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of myacquaintance."But just when Elizabeth's growing esteem and gratitude might havedeepened into affection for Darcy circumstances were communicated toher in a letter from Jane which seemed to render it in the highestdegree improbable that so proud and fastidious a man as he would evermake any further advances. Lydia who had got herself invited by somefriends to Brighton in order to be near the militia regiment which hadbeen transferred there from Meryton had eloped with Wickham and thepair instead of going to Scotland to be married appeared--though theirwhereabouts could not yet be discovered--to be living together in Londonunmarried.Darcy seemed to be staggered when he heard the news and instantlyacquiesced in the immediate return of the Gardiner party to Longbourn.They found on their arrival that Mr. Bennet was searching for hisdaughter in London where Mr. Gardiner agreed to go to consult with him."Oh my dear brother" said Mrs. Bennet on hearing this "that isexactly what I could most wish for And now do when you get to townfind them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already_make_ them marry. And as for wedding clothes do not let them wait forthat but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buythem after they are married. And above all things keep Mr. Bennet fromfighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightened
comment79,out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over mesuch spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at myheart that I can get no rest by day nor by night. And tell my dear Lydianot to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me forshe does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh brother how kindyou are I know you will contrive it all."Mr. Collins improved the occasion by writing a letter of condolence inwhich he assured the distressed father that the death of Lydia wouldhave been a blessing in comparison with her elopement. Butunfortunately much of this instruction was wasted the distress of theBennets proving less irremediable than their cousin had anticipated ortheir neighbours feared--for thanks as it seemed to theinvestigations and to the generosity of Mr. Gardiner the eloping couplewere discovered and it was made worth Wickham's while to marry Lydia.Longbourn society bore the good news with decent philosophy though tobe sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation hadMiss Lydia Bennet come upon the town._VI.--Three Bennet Weddings_After arrangements had been made for Wickham's entering the regulars andjoining a regiment at Newcastle his marriage with Lydia took place andthe young couple were received at Longbourn. Their assurance was quitereassuring."Well mamma" said Lydia "and what do you think of my husband Is nothe a charming man I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hopethey may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That isthe place to get husbands. What a pity it is mamma we did not all go""Very true. And if I had my will we should. But my dear Lydia I don'tat all like your going such a way off. Must it be so""Oh Lord yes There is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.You and papa and my sisters must come down and see us. We shall be atNewcastle all the winter and I dare say there will be some balls and Iwill take care to get good partners for them all.""I should like it beyond anything" said her mother."And then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sistersbehind you and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before thewinter is over.""I thank you for my share of the favour" said Elizabeth "but I do notparticularly like your way of getting husbands"Indeed from some remark which Lydia let slip about Darcy being at thewedding Elizabeth soon began to think that it was only due to outsideefforts that Mrs. Wickham had succeeded in getting _her own_ husband.An application for information which she made to her Aunt Gardinerconfirmed this suspicion. Darcy it seems had hurried up to London
comment80,immediately on hearing of the elopement and he it was who thanks tohis knowledge of Wickham's previous history found out where Lydia andhe were lodging and by dint of paying his debts to the tune of athousand pounds buying his commission and settling another thousandpounds on Lydia persuaded him to make her an honest woman. That is tosay thought Elizabeth Darcy had met frequently met reasoned withpersuaded and finally bribed the man whom he always most wished toavoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.Meantime Bingley accompanied by Darcy made his reappearance atNetherfield Park and at the Bennets' and Elizabeth had themortification of seeing her mother welcome the former with the greatesteffusiveness and treat the latter coldly and almost resentfully. "Anyfriend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure butelse I must say that I hate the very sight of him" said Mrs. Bennet asshe watched the two men approaching the house to pay their first visit.Despite however rather than by reason of this surfeit of amiabilityon the part of the mother the lovers quickly came to an understandingand this strangely enough in the absence of Darcy who had gone up totown. It was in Darcy's absence also that Lady Catherine de Bourghcame over to Longbourn and helped to bring about what she most ardentlywished to prevent by making an unsuccessful demand on Elizabeth that sheshould promise not to accept Darcy for a husband and by then reportingto him that Elizabeth had refused to give such a promise. The naturalresult followed. Elizabeth mustered up courage one day to thank Darcyfor all he had done for Lydia and this subject soon led _him_ to affirmthat in that matter he had thought only of Elizabeth and to renew--andto renew successfully--his former proposals of marriage. When Mrs.Bennet first heard the great news she sat quite still and unable toutter a syllable and at first even Jane and her father were almostincredulous of the engagement because they had seen practically nothingof the courtship. But in the end they were all convinced and Mr.Bennet's decisive comment was "I admire all my three sons-in-lawhighly. Wickham perhaps is my favourite but I think I shall like_your_ husband quite as well as Jane's. If any young men come for Maryor Kitty send them in for I am quite at leisure."                                   Northanger Abbey     "Northanger Abbey" was written in 1798 revised for the press     in 1803 and sold in the same year for 10 to a Bath
comment81,     bookseller who held it in such light esteem that after     allowing it to remain for many years on his shelves he was     content to sell it back to the novelist's brother Henry     Austen for the exact sum which he had paid for it at the     beginning not knowing that the writer was already the author     of four popular novels. This story--which is of course a     skit on the "terror" novel of Mrs. Radcliffe's school--was not     published till after its author's death when in 1818 it was     bound up with her last book "Persuasion."_I.--A Heroine in the Making_No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy could havesupposed her born to be a heroine. Her situation in life the characterof her father and mother her own person and disposition were allequally against her. Her father was a clergyman without being neglectedor poor and a very respectable man though his name was Richard and hehad never been handsome. He had a considerable independence besides twogood livings and he was not in the least addicted to locking up hisdaughters. Her mother was a woman of useful plain sense with a goodtemper and what is more remarkable with a good constitution. She hadthree sons before Catherine was born and instead of dying in bringingthe latter into the world as anybody might expect she still livedon--lived to have six children more--to see them growing up around herand to enjoy excellent health herself. Catherine for many years of herlife was as plain as any member of her family. She had a thin awkwardfigure a sallow skin without colour dark lank hair and strongfeatures. So much for her person and not less propitious for heroismseemed her mind. She was fond of all boys' sports and greatly preferredcricket not merely to dolls but to the more heroic enjoyments ofinfancy--nursing a dormouse feeding a canary-bird or watering arosebush. Indeed she had no taste for a garden and if she gatheredflowers at all it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief--at leastso it was conjectured from her habit of always preferring those whichshe was strictly forbidden to take.Such were her propensities her abilities were quite as extraordinary.She never could learn or understand anything before she was taught andsometimes not even then for she was often inattentive and occasionallystupid. Her mother wished her to learn music and Catherine was sure sheshould like it for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the oldforlorn spinet so at eight years old she began. She learnt a year andcould not bear it and Mrs. Morland who did not insist on her daughtersbeing accomplished in spite of incapacity or distaste allowed her toleave off. The day which dismissed the music-master was one of thehappiest of Catherine's life. Her taste for drawing was not superiorthough whenever she could obtain the outside of a letter from hermother or seize upon any other odd piece of paper she did what shecould in that way by drawing houses and trees hens and chickens allvery much like one another. Writing and accounts she was taught by her
comment82,father French by her mother. Her proficiency in either was notremarkable and she shirked her lessons in both whenever she could.What a strange unaccountable character For with all these symptoms ofprofligacy at ten years old she had neither a bad heart nor a badtemper was seldom stubborn scarcely ever quarrelsome and very kind tothe little ones with few interruptions of tyranny. She was noisy andwild hated confinement and cleanliness and loved nothing so well inthe world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house.Such was Catherine Morland at ten. At fifteen appearances were mendingshe began to curl her hair and long for balls her complexion improvedher features were softened by plumpness and colour her eyes gained moreanimation and her figure more consequence. Her love of dirt gave way toan inclination for finery she grew clean and she grew smart and shehad now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remarkon her personal improvement. From fifteen indeed to seventeen she wasin training for a heroine she read all such works as heroines must readto supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceableand so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives.So far her improvement was sufficient and in many other points she cameon exceedingly well for though she could not write sonnets she broughtherself to read them and though there seemed no chance of her throwinga whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte of her owncomposition she could listen to other people's performances with verylittle fatigue.Her greatest deficiency was in the pencil. She had no notion of drawingnot enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover's profile that shemight be detected in the design. There she fell miserably short of thetrue heroic height. At present she did not know her own poverty for shehad no lover to portray. There was not one lord in the neighbourhoodno not even a baronet There was not one family among theiracquaintance who had reared and supported a boy accidentally found attheir door no not one young man whose origin was unknown. Her fatherhad no ward and the squire of the parish no children. But when a young
comment83,lady is to be a heroine the perverseness of forty surrounding familiescannot prevent her. Something must and will happen to throw a hero inher way.Mr. Allen who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton thevillage in Wiltshire where the Morland family lived was ordered to Bathfor the benefit of a gouty constitution and his lady a good-humouredwoman fond of Miss Morland and probably aware that if adventures willnot befall a young lady in her own village she must seek them abroadinvited her to go with them. Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all complianceand Catherine all happiness._II.--In the Gay City of Bath_When the hour for departure drew nigh the maternal anxiety of Mrs.Morland will be naturally supposed to have been most severe. But sheknew so little of lords and baronets that she entertained no notion oftheir general mischievousness and was wholly unsuspicious of danger toher daughter from their machinations. Her cautions were confined toadvising her to wrap up well when she came from the rooms at night andto try to keep some account of the money she spent.Sally or rather Sarah must from situation be at this time theintimate friend and confidante of her sister. It is remarkable howeverthat she neither insisted on Catherine's writing by every post norexacted her promise of transmitting the character of every newacquaintance nor a detail of every interesting conversation that Bathmight produce. Everything indeed relative to this important journeywas done on the part of the Morlands with a strange degree of moderationand composure. Catherine's father instead of giving her an unlimitedorder on his banker or even putting a hundred pounds bankbill into herhands gave her only ten guineas and promised her more when she wantedit. The journey was performed with suitable quietness and uneventfulsafety. They arrived at Bath and were soon settled in comfortablelodgings in Pulteney Street.Mrs. Allen had not beauty genius accomplishment or manner. The air ofa gentlewoman a great deal of quiet inactive good temper and atrifling turn of mind were all that could account for her being thechoice of a sensible intelligent man like Mr. Allen. In one respect shewas admirably fitted to introduce a young lady into public being asfond of going everywhere and seeing everything herself as any young ladycould be. Dress was her passion and our heroine's entre into lifecould not take place till after three or four days had been spent inproviding her chaperon with a dress of the newest fashion. Catherinetoo made some purchases herself and when all those matters werearranged the important evening came which was to usher her into theupper rooms. But nothing happened that evening. Mrs. Allen knew nobodythere and so Catherine was unable to dance.A day or two later when they made their appearance in the lower roomsfortune was more favourable to our heroine. The master of the ceremoniesintroduced to her a very gentleman-like young man as a partner. His namewas Tilney. He was a clergyman seemed to be about four or five andtwenty was rather tall had a pleasing countenance a very intelligentand lively eye and if not quite handsome was very near it. Hisaddress was good he talked with fluency and spirit and there was anarchness and pleasantry in his manner which interested though it washardly understood by her. Catherine felt herself in high luck and theyparted on the lady's side at least with a strong inclination forcontinuing the acquaintance.But when Catherine hastened to the pump-room the next day there was noMr. Tilney to be seen. Instead Mrs. Allen had the good fortune to meetan acquaintance at last in the person of a Mrs. Thorpe a formerschoolfellow whom she had seen only once since their respectivemarriages. Their joy on this meeting was very great as well it mightbe since they had been contented to know nothing of each other for the
comment84,last fifteen years. Mrs. Thorpe had one great advantage as a talker overMrs. Allen in a family of children and when she had expatiated on thetalents of her sons and the beauty of her daughters Mrs. Allen had nosimilar information to give no similar triumphs to press on theunwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend. She was forced to sit andto appear to listen to all these maternal effusions and to beintroduced along with Catherine to the three Miss Thorpes who provedto be sisters of a young man who was at the same college as Catherine'sbrother James. James indeed had actually spent the last week of theChristmas vacation with the family near London.The progress of the friendship thus entered into by Catherine andIsabella the eldest of the Miss Thorpes was quick as its beginning waswarm and they passed so rapidly through every gradation of increasingtenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of it to be given totheir friends and themselves. They called each other by their Christianname were always arm in arm when they walked pinned up each other'strain for the dance and were not to be divided in the set and if arainy morning deprived them of other enjoyments they were stillresolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt and shut themselves upto read novels together. One day after they had been talking of"Udolpho" of other "horrid" books and of their favourite complexion ina man they met Catherine's brother James and Isabella's brother John ina gig. On introduction the latter proved to be a smart young man ofmiddle height who with a plain face and ungraceful form seemedfearful of being too handsome unless he wore the dress of a groom andtoo much like a gentleman unless he were easy where he ought to becivil and impudent where he might be allowed to be easy. James ofcourse was attached to Isabella. "She has so much good sense" he said"and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable."At the dance at the upper rooms which took place on the evening of thesame day Mr. Tilney made his reappearance and introduced his sister toCatherine. Miss Tilney had a good figure a pretty face and a veryagreeable countenance. Her air though it had not all the decidedpretension the resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe's had more realelegance and her manners showed better sense and better breeding. Sheseemed capable of being young and attractive at a ball without wantingto fix the attention of every man near her._III.--Catherine Morland Among Her Friends_Unfixed as Catherine's general notions were of a what a man ought to beshe could not entirely repress a doubt of Mr. John Thorpe's beingaltogether completely agreeable. A tattler and a swaggerer havingelicited as he thought from Catherine that she was the destinedheiress of Mr. Allen he twice endeavoured to detach her by a glaringlie from keeping engagements with the Tilneys and when he did succeedin persuading her to go with him in his gig she found that the whole ofhis talk ended with himself and his own concerns. He told her of horseswhich he had bought for a trifle and sold for incredible sums of racingmatches in which his judgment had infallibly foretold the winner ofshooting-parties in which he had killed more birds though withouthaving one good shot than all his companions together and described toher some famous days spent with the foxhounds in which his foresightand skill in directing the dogs had repaired the mistakes of the mostexperienced huntsman and in which the boldness of his riding though it
comment85,had never endangered his own life for a single moment had beenconstantly leading others into difficulties which he calmly concludedhad broken the necks of more than one person.All this rather wearied Catherine and not even his relating to her thatMr. Tilney's father General Tilney--whom he was talking to one night atthe theatre--had declared her the finest girl in Bath could reconcileher to the idea that Mr. John Thorpe had the faculty of giving universalpleasure. It was a visit which she paid to Miss Tilney to apologise fornot keeping an engagement which Mr. John had caused her to break thatfirst introduced her to the general. A handsome stately well-bred manwith a temper that made him a martinet to his own children he receivedher with a politeness and even a deference that delighted andsurprised her. But whereas Catherine's simplicity of character made hergrowing attachment to Mr. Tilney obvious to that gentleman and to hissister it was not so clear that he reciprocated her feelings. Generallyhe amused himself by talking down to her or making fun of her in agood-natured way. One day they were speaking of Mrs. Radcliffe's worksand more particularly of the "Mysteries of Udolpho.""I have read all of Mrs. Radcliffe's works" said he "and most of themwith great pleasure.""I am very glad to hear it indeed" replied Catherine "and now I shallnever be ashamed of liking 'Udolpho' myself. But I really thought thatyoung men despised novels amazingly.""It is _amazingly_ it may well suggest _amazement_ if they do for theyread nearly as many as women" was Mr. Tilney's answer. "I myself haveread hundreds and hundreds. Do not imagine that you can cope with me ina knowledge of Julias and Louisas. Consider how many years I have hadthe start of you. I had entered on my studies at Oxford while you wereprobably a good little girl working your sampler at home""Not very good I am afraid. But now really do you not think 'Udolpho'the nicest book in the world""The nicest by which I suppose you mean the neatest. That must dependon the binding" said he."I am sure" cried Catherine hastily "I did not mean to say anythingwrong but it is a nice book and why should I not call it so""Very true" said Henry "and this is a very nice day and we are takinga very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies. Oh it is avery nice word indeed--it does for everything Originally perhaps itwas applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy orrefinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or intheir choice. But now every commendation on every subject is comprisedin that one word."Meanwhile Catherine was required to interest herself in her friend'slove affairs. Isabella surprised her one day with the news that she wasengaged to her brother James and obviously under the impression thather lover was the heir of a wealthy man seemed to wonder whether hisparents would acquiesce in the engagement. But despite her affection forJames she danced with Mr. Tilney's elder brother Captain Tilney at aball which was given while her betrothed was absent on the necessaryvisit to his parents and when letters were received from himannouncing their consent to the match and the agreement of Mr. Morlandto resign a living of four hundred pounds to his son and to bequeath tohim by will an estate of the same value Isabella looked grave first atthe smallness of the income and then at the fact that it would benearly three years before James would be old enough to take it.Meantime she continued to flirt rather openly with Captain Tilney muchto James' uneasiness and to his sister's distress. But Catherine was tosome extent reassured as to the captain's conduct by his brother Henryand she was so overjoyed by receiving an invitation from General Tilneyto pay a visit to Northanger Abbey his beautiful country seat that a
comment86,parting interview with Isabella and James at which he was in excellentspirits and she most engagingly placid left her blissfully convincedthat the behaviour of the lovers was a model of judicious affection._IV.--Romance at Northanger Abbey_The Tilney party set out for the Abbey in great state the ladies in thegeneral's chaise and four with postilions and numerous outriders andthe general and Henry in the latter's curricle. But at the first stagethe general proposed that Catherine should take his place in thecurricle that she might "see as much of the country as possible" andfor the rest of the journey she was tte--tte with Henry who amusedhimself by rallying her upon the sliding panels ghastly tapestryfunereal beds vaulted chambers and kindred uncanny apparatus whichjudging from her favourite kind of fiction she must be expecting tofind at the Abbey.As a matter of fact Northanger though it comprised some parts of theold Abbey turned out to be a building thoroughly modernized andimproved. Notwithstanding Catherine could not restrain her imaginationfrom running riot just a little. A large cedar chest curiously inlaidand provided with silver handles first attracted her attention. Butthis was soon found to contain merely a white cotton counterpane. A highold-fashioned ebony cabinet which she noticed in her bedroom justbefore stepping into bed struck her as offering more promise ofromantic interest. Even this after a most thrilling search in themidst of which her candle went out yielded nothing better than aninventory of linen.Still Catherine's passion for romance was not easily to bedisappointed. Hearing from Eleanor Tilney that her mother's fatalillness had been sudden and short and had taken place in her absencefrom home Catherine's blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions thatnaturally sprang from these words. Could it be possible Could Henry'sfather---- And yet how many were the examples to justify even theblackest suspicions And when she saw him in the evening while sheworked with her friend slowly pacing the drawing-room for an hourtogether in silent thoughtfulness with downcast eye and contractedbrow she felt secure from all possibility of wronging him. It wasindeed the air and attitude of a Montoni What could more plainly speakthe gloomy workings of a mind not wholly dead to every sense ofhumanity in its fearful review of past scenes of guiltFull then of the idea that the general had ill-treated his wife readyeven to believe that she might still be living and a prisoner our
comment87,heroine set out one day to explore a certain set of rooms into which thegeneral in showing her over the house had not taken her. But she wascaught in the act by Henry Tilney who revealed with customaryopenness what had been in her mind and received only a very gentlerebuke.Most grievously was she humbled. Her folly which now seemed evencriminal was all exposed to him and he must surely despise her forever. But he did nothing of the kind. His astonishing generosity andnobleness of conduct were such that the only difference he made in hisbehaviour to her was to pay her somewhat more attention than usual.But the anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms ofromance. Catherine's desire of hearing from Isabella grew every daygreater. For nine successive mornings she wondered over the repetitionof disappointment and then on the tenth she got a letter--not fromIsabella but from James announcing the breaking off of the engagementby mutual consent. At first she was much upset by the news and burstinto tears. But in the end she saw it in a more philosophic light sothat before long Henry was able to rally her on her former bosomfriendship with Miss Thorpe without offending her. And when a day or twolater a letter arrived from Isabella containing the amazing sentences"I am quite uneasy about your dear brother not having heard from himsince he went to Oxford and am fearful of some misunderstanding. Yourkind offices will set all right he is the only man I ever did or couldlove and I trust you will convince him of it----" Catherine resolved"No whatever would happen James should never hear Isabella's namementioned by her again."Soon afterwards a bolt fell from the blue. General Tilney who had paidCatherine the most embarrassing attentions suddenly and unexpectedlyreturned from town where he had gone for a day or two on business andpacked Catherine off home immediately with hardly an apology and atscarcely a moment's notice. He had met young Thorpe in town it seemedand John had this time under-estimated the wealth and consequence of theMorlands as much as he had over-stated them before when he talked to thegeneral in the theatre at Bath.The rudeness of the general however proved not so very great adisaster to Catherine. The interest and liking which Henry had firstfelt for her had gradually grown into a warmer feeling and roused to asense of this by his father's tyrannical behaviour he presented himselfto Catherine at Fullerton proposed to her and was accepted. It was notlong before the general gave his consent. Getting at last to a rightunderstanding of Mr. Morland's circumstances--which he found wouldallow Catherine to have three thousand pounds--and delighted by therecent marriage of his daughter Eleanor to a viscount he agreed to theunion and so Henry and Catherine were married within a twelvemonth fromthe first day of their meeting.                                   Mansfield Park     And then between 1812 and 1814. "Mansfield Park" was written     at Chawton Cottage and published in July of the latter year
comment88,     by the Mr. Egerton who had given to the world its two     predecessors. When the novel reached a second edition its     publication was taken over by John Murray who was also     responsible for bringing out its successor "Emma." As bearing     on the introduction of naval officers into the story in this     novel and in "Persuasion" it must be remembered that Jane     Austen's two youngest brothers Francis and Charles both     served in the Navy during the French wars and both rose to     the rank of admiral Jane herself lived at Southampton from     1805 to 1809 and was therefore in a position to visit     Portsmouth and to see the sailor's life ashore._I.--Sir Thomas Bertram's Family Connections_Miss Maria Ward of Huntingdon with only seven thousand pounds had thegood luck to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram of Mansfield Park in thecounty of Northampton and to be thereby raised to the rank of abaronet's lady with all the comforts and consequences of a handsomehouse and large income. She had two sisters to be benefited by herelevation and such of their acquaintances as thought Miss Ward and MissFrances quite as handsome as Miss Maria did not scruple to predict theirmarrying with almost equal advantage. But there certainly are not somany men of large fortune in the world as there are pretty women todeserve them. Miss Ward at the end of half a dozen years found herselfobliged to be attached to the Rev. Mr. Norris a friend of herbrother-in-law's with scarcely any private fortune and Miss Francesfared yet worse.Miss Ward's match indeed when it came to the point was notcontemptible Sir Thomas being happily able to give his friend in theliving of Mansfield an income of very little less than a thousand ayear. But Miss Frances married in the common phrase to disoblige herfamily and by fixing on a lieutenant of marines named Price withouteducation fortune or connections did it very thoroughly. To escaperemonstrance she never wrote to her family on the subject till actuallymarried.Lady Bertram who was a woman of very tranquil feelings and a temperremarkably easy and indolent would have contented herself with merelygiving up her sister and thinking no more of the matter but Mrs.Norris had a spirit of activity which could not be satisfied till shehad written a long and angry letter to Fanny. Mrs. Price in her turn
comment89,was injured and angry and an answer which comprehended both sisters inits bitterness and bestowed such very disrespectful reflections on thepride of Sir Thomas as Mrs. Norris could not possibly keep to herselfput an end to all intercourse between them for a considerable period.By the end of eleven years however Mrs. Price could no longer affordto cherish pride or resentment or to lose one connection that mightpossibly assist her. A very small income a large and still increasingfamily a husband disabled for active service but not the less equal tocompany and good liquor made her eager to regain the friends she had socarelessly sacrificed and she addressed Lady Bertram a letter whichspoke so much contrition and despondence as could not but dispose themall to a reconciliation. The letter re-established peace and kindness.Sir Thomas sent friendly advice and professions Lady Bertram dispatchedmoney and baby-linen for the expected child and Mrs. Norris wrote theletters.Within a twelvemonth a more important advantage to Mrs. Price resultedfrom her letter. Mrs. Norris who was often observing to the others thatshe seemed to be wanting to do more for her poor sister proposed thatthe latter should be entirely relieved from the charge and expense ofher eldest daughter Fanny a girl of ten and Sir Thomas afterdebating the question assented. The division of gratifying sensationsin the consideration of so benevolent a scheme ought not in strictjustice to have been equal for while Sir Thomas was fully resolved tobe the real and consistent patron of the selected child Mrs. Norris hadnot the least intention of being at any expense whatever in hermaintenance. As far as walking talking and contriving reached she wasthoroughly benevolent and nobody knows better how to dictate liberalityto others but her love of money was equal to her love of directing andshe knew quite as well how to save her own as to spend that of herfriends.Fanny Price proved to be small for her age with no glow of complexionor any other striking beauty exceedingly timid and shy and shrinkingfrom notice but her air though awkward was not vulgar her voice wassweet and when she spoke her countenance was pretty. Sir Thomas andLady Bertram received her very kindly and Sir Thomas seeing how muchshe needed encouragement tried to be all that was conciliating. But hehad to work against a most untoward gravity of deportment and LadyBertram without taking half so much trouble by the mere aid of agood-humoured smile became immediately the less awful character of thetwo.The young people were all at home and sustained their share in theintroduction very well with much good humour and little embarrassment.They were a remarkably fine family the sons Tom and Edmund boys ofseventeen and sixteen very well looking the daughters Maria agedthirteen and Julia twelve decidedly handsome.But it took a long time to reconcile Fanny to the novelty of MansfieldPark and to the separation from everybody she had been used to. Nobodymeant to be unkind but nobody put himself out of the way to secure hercomfort. She was disheartened by Lady Bertram's silence awed by SirThomas's grave looks and quite overcome by Mrs. Norris's admonitions.Her elder cousins mortified her by reflections on her size and abashedher by noticing her shyness Miss Lee the governess wondered at herignorance and the maidservants sneered at her clothes. It was not tillEdmund found her crying one morning on the attic stairs and comfortedher that things began to mend for her. He was ever afterwards her truefriend and next to her dear brother William first in her affectionsand from that day she grew more comfortable.
comment90,_II.--Cupid at Mansfield Park_The first event of any importance in the family's affairs was the deathof Mr. Norris which happened when Fanny was about fifteen andnecessarily introduced alterations and novelties. Mrs. Norris onquitting the parsonage removed first to the Park and then arranged totake a small dwelling in the village belonging to Sir Thomas and calledthe White House. The living had been destined for Edmund and inordinary circumstances would have been duly given to some friend to holdtill he were old enough to take orders. But Tom's extravagances had beenso great as to render a different disposal of the next presentationnecessary and so the reversion was sold to a Dr. Grant a hearty man offorty-five fond of good eating married to a wife about fifteen yearshis junior and unprovided with children.The Grants had scarcely been settled in Mansfield a year when for thebetter settlement of his property in the West Indies Sir Thomas hadfound it expedient to go to Antigua and he took his elder son with himin the hope of detaching him from some bad connections at home. Neitherperson was missed.Lady Bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her but shewas not disturbed by any alarm for his safety or solicitude for hiscomfort being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerousor difficult or fatiguing to anybody but themselves. Before very longshe found that Edmund could quite sufficiently supply his father'splace. On this occasion the Miss Bertrams who were now fullyestablished among the belles of the neighbourhood were much to bepitied not for their sorrow but for their want of it. Their father wasno object of love to them he had never seemed the friend of theirpleasures and his absence was unhappily most welcome.Fanny's relief and her consciousness of it were quite equal to hercousins' but a more tender nature suggested that her feelings wereungrateful and she really grieved because she could not grieve.Meantime taking advantage of her sister's indolence Mrs. Norris actedas chaperon to Maria and Julia in their public engagements and verythoroughly relished the means this afforded her of mixing in societywithout having horses to hire.Fanny had no share in the festivities of the season but she enjoyedbeing avowedly useful as her aunt's companion and talked to LadyBertram listened to her and read to her with never a thought of envyingher cousins their gaieties. About this time Maria who was now in hertwenty-first year got engaged to a rich but heavy country gentleman
comment91,called Rushworth merely because he had an income larger than herfather's and could give her a house in town while Tom returned safelyfrom the West Indies bringing an excellent account of his father'shealth but telling the family that Sir Thomas would be detained inAntigua for several months longer.Such was the state of affairs in the month of July and Fanny had justreached her eighteenth year when the society of the village received anaddition in the brother and sister of Mrs. Grant a Mr. and MissCrawford the children of her mother by a second marriage. They wereyoung people of fortune the son having a good estate in Norfolk thedaughter twenty thousand pounds. They had been brought up by theirfather's brother and his wife Admiral and Mrs. Crawford and it wasMrs. Crawford's death and the consequent installation of the admiral'smistress in the house that had forced them to find another home. MaryCrawford was remarkably pretty Henry though not handsome had air andcountenance the manners of both were lively and pleasant and Mrs.Grant gave them credit for everything else.The young people were pleased with each other from the first. MissCrawford was most allowably a sweet pretty girl while the MissBertrams were the finest young women in the country. Mr. Crawford wasthe most agreeable young man Julia and Maria had ever known. Before hehad been at Mansfield a week the former lady was quite ready to befallen in love with while as for the latter she did not want to see orto understand. "There could be no harm in her liking an agreeableman--everybody knew her situation--Mr. Crawford must take care ofhimself."A young woman pretty lively witty playing on a harp as elegant asherself was enough to catch any man's heart. Without studying thebusiness however or knowing what he was about Edmund was beginningat the end of a week of such intercourse to be a good deal in love withMary Crawford and to the credit of the lady it may be added thatwithout his being a man of the world or an elder brother without any ofthe arts of flattery or the gaieties of small-talk he began to beagreeable to her. He taught her to ride on a horse which he had given to
comment92,Fanny he was always going round to see her at the parsonage andalthough he disapproved of the flippancy with which she talked of herrelations of religion and of his future profession of clergyman hewas never weary of discussing her and of confessing his admiration ofher to Fanny.Harry Crawford was not so constant as his sister. On an expedition toSotherton Court Mr. Rushworth's place he flirted with Julia on the waydown and with Maria when Sotherton was reached leaving poor Mr.Rushworth no resource but to declare to Fanny his surprise at anyonecalling so undersized a man as his rival handsome.Some rehearsals of a play called "Lovers' Vows" in which Harry leftMaria happy and expectant and Julia furious by assigning the parts ofthe lovers to the elder sister and to himself made Mr. Rushworth evenjealous. But this theatrical scheme to which even Edmund had beenforced to lend a reluctant co-operation--merely with a view ofpreventing outside actors being introduced--happily came to nothingthanks to the unexpected arrival of Sir Thomas._III.--Fanny in Society_Maria was now expecting the man she loved to declare himself butinstead of making such a declaration of attachment Harry Crawford leftthe neighbourhood almost immediately on the plea of having to meet hisuncle at Bath. Maria wounded and indignant resolved that though hehad destroyed her happiness he should not know that he had done so. Sowhen her father having in an evening spent at Sotherton discoveredwhat a very inferior young man Mr. Rushworth was and having noticedMaria's complete indifference to him offered to give up the connectionif she felt herself unhappy in the prospect of it she merely thankedhim and said she had not the smallest desire of breaking through herengagement and was not sensible of any change of opinion or inclinationsince her forming it. In a few weeks' time she was married to Mr.Rushworth and after a day or two spent at Sotherton the wedded pairwent off to Brighton where they were joined by Julia Bertram.Meantime Fanny as the only young lady left at the Park became ofimportance. Sir Thomas decided that she was pretty Miss Crawfordcultivated her society and Mrs. Grant asked her to dinner. Thislast-mentioned attention disturbed Lady Bertram."So strange" she said. "For Mrs. Grant never used to ask her.""But it is very natural" observed Edmund "that Mrs. Grant should wishto procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister.""Nothing can be more natural" said Sir Thomas after a shortdeliberation "nor were there no sister in the case could anything inmy opinion be more natural. Mrs. Grant's showing civility to MissPrice to Lady Bertram's niece could never want explanation. The onlysurprise I can feel is that this should be the first time of its beingpaid. Fanny was right in giving only a conditional answer. She appearsto feel as she ought. But as I conclude that she wishes to go sinceall young people like to be together I can see no reason why she should
comment93,be denied this indulgence.""Upon my word Fanny" said Mrs. Norris "you are in high luck to meetwith such attention and indulgence. You ought to be very much obliged toMrs. Grant for thinking of you and to your aunt for letting you go andyou ought to look upon it as something extraordinary for I hope you areaware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in thissort of way or ever dining out at all and it is what you must notdepend upon ever being repeated. Nor must you be fancying that theinvitation is meant as a compliment to you the compliment is intendedto your uncle and aunt and me. Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to_us_ to take a little notice of you or else it would never have comeinto her head and you may be certain that if your cousin Julia had beenat home you would not have been asked."Mrs. Norris fetched breath and went on."I think it right to give you a hint Fanny now that you are going intocompany without any of us and I do beseech and entreat you not to beputting yourself forward and talking and giving your opinion as if youwere one of your cousins--as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia.That will never do believe me. Remember wherever you are you must bethe lowest and last and though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home atthe Parsonage you are not to be taking place of her. And as to comingaway at night you are to stay just as long as Edmund chooses.""Yes ma'am. I should not think of anything else.""And if it should rain--which I think likely for I never saw it morethreatening for a wet evening in my life--you must manage as well as youcan and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you.""Walk" said Sir Thomas in a tone of unanswerable dignity and comingfurther into the room "My niece walk to an engagement at this time ofthe year Fanny will twenty minutes after four suit you"A few weeks later Fanny was made happy by a visit from her brotherWilliam now through Sir Thomas's influence a midshipman and soon theformer intercourse between the families at the Park and at the Parsonagewas revived Sir Thomas perceiving in a careless way that Mr.Crawford who was back again at Mansfield was somewhat distinguishinghis niece.Harry indeed was beginning to be rather piqued by Fanny'sindifference."I do not quite know what to make of Miss Fanny" he said to his sister."Is she solemn Is she queer Is she prudish I can hardly get her tospeak. I never was so long in company with a girl in my life trying toentertain her and succeeded so ill Never met with a girl who looked sograve on me.""Foolish fellow" said Mary. "And so this is her attraction after allThis it is--her not caring for you--which gives her such a soft skin andmakes her so much taller and produces all these charms and graces I dodesire that you will not be making her really unhappy. A little loveperhaps may animate and do her good but I will not have you plunge herdeep for she is as good a little creature as ever lived and has agreat deal of feeling.""It can be but for a fortnight" said Harry "and if a fortnight cankill her she must have a constitution which nothing could save No Iwill not do her any harm. I only want her to look kindly on me to giveme smiles as well as blushes to keep a chair for me by herself whereverwe are and be all animation when I take it and talk to her to think asI think to be interested in all my possessions and pleasures try tokeep me longer at Mansfield and feel when I go away that she shall
comment94,never be happy again. I want nothing more.""Moderation itself" replied Mary. "I can have no scruples now. Wellyou will have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommendyourself for we are a great deal together."Harry was unable to make any impression on Fanny and though he felldeeply in love with her got her brother William made lieutenant andafter a ball given in her honour by Sir Thomas proposed to her he wasunable to win her favour. She was in love with Edmund and Edmund wastorn between love for Mary despair of winning her and disapproval ofher principles._IV.--Wedding Bells at Mansfield_Mr. William Price second lieutenant of H.M.S. Thrush having obtained aten days' leave of absence again went down to see his sister and SirThomas as a kind of medicinal project on his niece's understandingjust to enable her to contrast with her father's shabby dwelling anabode of wealth and plenty like Mansfield Park arranged that she shouldaccompany her brother back to Portsmouth and spend a little time withher own family. Within four days from their arrival William had to sailand Fanny could not conceal it from herself that the home he had lefther in was in almost every respect the very reverse of what she couldhave wished. It was the abode of noise disorder and impropriety. Nobodywas in his right place nothing was done as it ought to be. She couldnot respect her parents as she had hoped. Her father was more negligentof his family worse in his habits coarser in his manners than she hadbeen prepared for. He did not want abilities but he had no curiosityand no information beyond his profession. He read only the newspaper andthe Navy List. He talked only of the dockyard the harbour Spitheadand the Motherbank. He swore and he drank he was dirty and gross.She had never been able to recall anything approaching to tenderness inhis former treatment of herself. There had remained only a generalimpression of roughness and now he scarcely ever noticed her but tomake her the object of a coarse joke.Her disappointment in her mother was greater. There she had hoped muchand found almost nothing. She discovered indeed that her mother was apartial ill-judging parent a dawdle a slattern who neither taughtnor restrained her children whose house was the scene of mismanagementand discomfort from beginning to end and who had no talent noconversation no affection towards herself no curiosity to know herbetter no desire of her friendship and no inclination for her companythat could lessen her sense of such knowledge.At the end of the fourth week of her visit Harry Crawford came to seeFanny made himself very agreeable to her and her family and then wentback to town to see his sister and to meet such friends as EdmundBertram and the Rushworths. Fanny heard from Mary of Maria's fine housein Wimpole Street of the splendours of the first party and of theattentions paid to Julia by that would-be amateur actor the HonourableJohn Yates while from Edmund she gathered that his hopes of securing
comment95,Mary were weaker than those he had cherished when he had left Mansfieldand that he was more satisfied with all that he saw and heard of HarryCrawford."I cannot give her up Fanny" Edmund wrote of Mary. "She is the onlywoman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife." Mary on herpart hearing of a serious illness which had prostrated Tom Bertramcould not forbear saying to the same correspondent "Poor young man Ifhe is to die there will be two poor young men less in the world. I putit to your conscience whether 'Sir' Edmund would not do more good withall the Bertram property than any other possible 'sir.'" She also toldFanny that Mrs. Rushworth in the absence of her husband on a visit tohis mother at Bath had been spending the Easter with some friends atTwickenham and that her brother Harry had also been passing a few daysat Richmond.The interval of a few days afforded a commentary on this last piece ofnews. It turned out that Mrs. Rushworth having succumbed once more tothe protestations of Harry Crawford had left her house in WimpoleStreet to live with him and that her sister Julia had eloped toScotland to be married to Mr. Yates. On the occurrence of thisdistressing news Fanny was summoned back to Mansfield Park and wasescorted down there by Edmund who described to her his final interviewwith Mary. It seemed that Mary's distress at her brother's folly was somuch more keenly expressed than any sorrow for his sin that Edmund'sconscience left him no alternative but to make an end of theiracquaintance.Indeed before many weeks had passed he ceased to care about MissCrawford and became as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself coulddesire and before many months had gone the cousins were united. Norwas this the only happy event that occurred at Mansfield. Harry Crawfordand Mrs. Rushworth having quarrelled and parted and Sir Thomas havingrefused to allow his elder daughter to come home Mrs. Norris cast offthe dust of Mansfield from her feet and went to live with her niece inan establishment arranged for them in another county. While as for Tomhe gradually regained his health without regaining the thoughtlessnessand selfishness of his previous habits and was in fact improvedforever by his illness.                                   Emma     "Emma" one of the author's later novels had been finished     when in the autumn of 1815 Jane Austen came to London to     nurse her brother Henry who was a clergyman at his house in     Hans Place in Chelsea. He was being attended by one of the     Prince Regent's physicians who seems to have learned in this     way the secret of the authorship of "Mansfield Park" and its     predecessors. The result was that the Prince who is said to     have been a great admirer of these then anonymous novels was     graciously pleased to notify Miss Austen through his     chaplain Mr. Clarke that if she had any new novel in hand     she was at liberty to dedicate it to his Royal Highness.     "Emma" was accordingly dedicated to the Prince. It was     reviewed along with its author's other novels in the     "Quarterly" and the anonymous reviewer who took no notice of     "Mansfield Park" turns out to have been none other than Sir     Walter Scott. In his Diary for March 14 1826 Sir Walter     further praised Miss Austen's exquisite touch and her gift for     true description and sentiment._I.--The Social Amenities of Highbury_Emma Woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home andhappy disposition was the younger of the two daughters of a mostaffectionate and indulgent father and had in consequence of hersister's marriage been mistress of his house from a very early period.Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinctremembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied by MissTaylor who for sixteen years had been in Mr. Woodhouse's family lessas governess than friend very fond of both daughters but particularlyof Emma. For years the two ladies had been living together mutely
comment96,attached Emma doing just what she liked highly esteeming Miss Taylor'sjudgment but chiefly directed by her own.The real evils indeed of Emma's situation were the power of havingrather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little toowell of herself. The danger however was at present unperceived anddid not by any means rank as a misfortune with her.Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow. Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor'sloss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of thisbeloved friend with the wedding over and the bride-people gone thatEmma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance. The event hadevery promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was a man ofunexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age and pleasantmanners and there was some satisfaction in considering with whatself-denying generous friendship she had always wished and promoted thematch. But it was a black morning's work for her. The want of MissTaylor would be felt every hour of every day. She had been a friend andcompanion such as few possessed intelligent well-informed usefulgentle knowing all the ways of the family interested in all itsconcerns and peculiarly interested in herself in every pleasure everyscheme of hers--one to whom she could speak every thought and who hadsuch an affection for her as could never find fault.How was Emma to bear the change She was now in great danger ofsuffering from intellectual solitude. She dearly loved her father buthe was no companion for her. He could not meet her in conversationrational or playful. The evil of the actual disparity in their ages asMr. Woodhouse had not married early was much increased by hisconstitution and habits for having been a valetudinarian all his lifewithout activity of mind or body he was a much older man in ways thanin years and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of hisheart and his amiable temper his talents could not have recommended himat any time.Emma's sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimonybeing settled in London only sixteen miles off was much beyond herdaily reach and it was quite three months before Christmas that wouldbring the next visit from Isabella her husband and children.Highbury the large and populous village to which her house Hartfieldreally belonged afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were first inconsequence there. All looked up to them but there was not one of heracquaintances among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylorfor even half a day. It was a melancholy change and Emma could not butsigh over it and wish for impossible things till her father awoke fromhis usual after-dinner sleep and made it necessary to be cheerful. Hisspirits required support. He was a nervous man easily depressed fondof everybody he was used to and hating to part with them hating changeof every kind. Matrimony as the origin of change was alwaysdisagreeable to him and he was not yet reconciled to his own daughtermarrying nor could ever speak of her but with compassion though it hadbeen entirely a match of affection when he was now obliged to part withMiss Taylor too.He was pitying "poor Miss Taylor" and magnifying the half-mile'sdistance that separated Hartfield from Mr. Weston's place Randallswhen a visitor walked in. This was Mr. George Knightley the elderbrother of Isabella's husband and the owner of Donwell Abbey the largeestate of the district. He was a sensible man about seven or eight andthirty a very old and intimate friend of the family and a frequent andalways welcome visitor. He had returned to a late dinner after somedays' absence in London and had walked up to Hartfield to say that all
comment97,was well with their relatives in Brunswick Square. They talked of thewedding. Emma congratulated herself on having made the match. Mr.Knightley demurred to this remarking "A straightforward open-heartedman like Weston and a rational unaffected woman like Miss Taylormay be safely left to manage their own concerns." And when Emma inreply to entreaties from her father to make no more matches answered"Only one more papa only for Mr. Elton--you like Mr. Elton papa Imust look about for a wife for him"--her old friend gave her thesalutary advice "Invite him to dinner Emma and help him to the bestof the fish and the chicken but leave him to choose his own wife.Depend upon it a man of six or seven and twenty can take care ofhimself."_II.--Emma as a Matchmaker_Emma lost no time in developing her schemes for the happiness of Mr.Elton. Through Mrs. Goddard the mistress of the local boarding-schoolfor girls she struck up an acquaintance which she contrived rapidly todevelop into intimacy with a Miss Harriet Smith--a plump fair-hairedblue-eyed little beauty of seventeen whose prettiness docilitygood-temper and simplicity might be allowed to balance her lack ofintelligence and information.Harriet was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed herseveral years back at Mrs. Goddard's school and somebody had latelyraised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder.This was all that was generally known of her history. She had no visiblefriends but what had been acquired at Highbury and was now justreturned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies--theMisses Martin--who had been at school there with her.The first step which Emma took in the education of Harriet was to coolher interest in the Martins. She pointed out that Mr. Robert Martin whoheld a large farm from Mr. Knightley in Donwell parish was too young tomarry at twenty-four that he had besides an awkward look an abruptmanner and an uncouth voice and that moreover he was quite plain-looking and wholly ungenteel whereas Mr. Elton who was good-humouredcheerful obliging and gentle was a pattern of good manners and goodlooks and seemed to be taking quite an interest in Harriet. So indeedit appeared. Mr. Elton seemed delighted with being in the society ofEmma and Harriet. He praised Harriet as a beautiful girl congratulatedEmma on the improvement she had wrought in her contributed a charade toHarriet's riddle-book and took a most animated interest in a portraitwhich Emma began to paint of her.But Mr. Knightley was not so complacent. "I think Harriet" he said to
comment98,Mrs. Weston "the very worst sort of a companion that Emma couldpossibly have. She knows nothing herself and looks upon Emma as knowingeverything. Her ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine shehas anything to learn herself while Harriet is presenting such adelightful inferiority And as for Harriet Hartfield will only put herout of conceit with all the other places she belongs to. She will growjust refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth andcircumstances have placed her."This was in the early stages of the intimacy. Later in the day when helearned that Emma had taken so decided a hand in the affairs of Harrietas to persuade her to decline a formal offer of marriage from Mr.Martin he told her plainly"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy though I have kept mythoughts to myself but now I perceive that it will be a veryunfortunate one for Harriet. You will puff her up with such ideas of herown beauty and what she has claim to that in a little while nobodywithin her reach will be good enough for her. Robert Martin has no greatloss if he can but think so and I hope it will not be long before hedoes. Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself but as youmake no secret of your love of match-making I shall just hint to you asa friend that if Elton is the man I think it will be all labour invain."Emma laughed and disclaimed. "Depend upon it" he continued "Elton willnot do. Elton is a very good sort of a man and a very respectable vicarof Highbury but not at all likely to make an imprudent match. He is aswell acquainted with his own claims as you can be with Harriet's and Iam convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away."But despite this warning from Mr. George Knightley despite a hintdropped by Mr. John Knightley when he and his wife and children came tostop with the Woodhouses for Christmas--a hint to the effect that hissister-in-law would do well to consider whether Mr. Elton was not inlove with _her_--Emma continued quite as ardent in her new friendshipand in her hopes.As to herself she told Harriet that she was not going to be married atpresent and had very little intention of ever marrying at all thoughwhen Harriet reminded her of Miss Bates who was the daughter of aformer vicar of Highbury and lived in a very small way with her mothera very old lady almost past everything but tea and quadrille sheconfessed that if she thought she would ever be like Miss Bates "sosilly so satisfied so smiling so prosing so undistinguishing sounfastidious and so garrulous" she would marry to-morrow.But Mr. Elton was unaware of Emma having thought of making such a
comment99,self-denying ordinance and so one night when the Woodhouses and theKnightleys were returning home from a party at Randalls he tookadvantage of his being alone in a carriage with her to propose to herseeming never to doubt his being accepted. When he learned however forwhom his hand had been destined he became very indignant andcontemptuous."Never madam" cried he. "Never I assure you _I_ think seriously ofMiss Smith Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl and I should behappy to see her respectably settled. I wish her extremely well and nodoubt there are men who might not object to--Everybody has their levelbut as for myself I am not I think quite so much at a loss. I neednot so totally despair of an equal alliance as to be addressing myselfto Miss Smith No madam my visits to Hatfield have been for yourselfonly."Needless to say Emma refused him and they parted on terms of mutuallydeep mortification. Fortunately the task of enlightening Harriet as tothe state of Mr. Elton's feelings proved less troublesome than Emma hadexpected it to be. Harriet's tears fell abundantly but otherwise shebore the intelligence very meekly and well._III.--Emma's Schemes in a Tangle_As if to make up for the absence of Mr. Elton who went to spend a fewweeks in Bath in an endeavour to cure his wounded affections. Highburysociety was shortly enlarged by the arrival of two such welcomeadditions as Miss Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill.Miss Fairfax who was the orphan daughter of Lieutenant Fairfax andMiss Janes Bates had for many years been living with her father'sbrother-officer Colonel Campbell and his wife and daughter. Abeautiful girl of nineteen with only a few hundred pounds of her ownand no monetary expectations from her adoptive father she had receivedsuch an education as qualified her to become a governess and though aslong as Colonel and Mrs. Campbell lived their home might always be hersshe had all along resolved to start earning her own living at one-and-twenty. Her friend Miss Campbell had recently married a rich andagreeable young man called Dixon and though the Dixons had urgentlyinvited her to join Colonel and Mrs. Campbell in a visit to them inIreland Jane preferred to spend three months' holiday with her aunt andgrandmother at Highbury with some vague intention of starting herscholastic career at the end of this period. Emma did not like JaneFairfax partly because Jane's aunt was always boring people by talkingof her partly perhaps because--as Mr. Knightley once told her--shesaw in her the really accomplished young woman which she wanted to bethought herself. At any rate she still found her as reserved as ever.Jane had been a little acquainted with Mr. Frank Churchill at Weymouthbut she either could not or would not tell Emma anything about him.That gentleman however soon presented himself in person. He was theson of Mr. Weston by his first wife. At the age of three he had beenadopted by his maternal uncle Mr. Churchill and so avowedly had hebeen brought up as their heir by Mr. and Mrs. Churchill--who had nochildren of their own--that on his coming of age he had assumed the nameof Churchill. For some months he had been promising to pay a visit tohis father and stepmother to compliment them on their marriage but onthe pretext of his not being able to leave Enscombe his uncle's placeit had been repeatedly postponed.Emma was inclined to make allowances for him as a young man dependent onthe caprices of relations. But Mr. Knightley condemned his conductroundly. "He cannot want money he cannot want leisure" he said. "Weknow on the contrary that he has so much of both that he is glad toget rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom." Notwithstandingwhen he did arrive Frank Churchill carried all before him by reason ofhis good looks sprightliness and amiability. Emma and he soon becamegreat friends. He favoured an idea of hers that Jane's refusal to go tothe Dixons' in Ireland was due either to Mr. Dixon's attachment to heror to her attachment to Mr. Dixon. When a Broadwood pianoforte arrivedfor Jane--which was generally taken to be a gift from Colonel
comment100,Campbell--he agreed with her in thinking that this was anotheroccurrence for which Mr. Dixon's love was responsible and he was busilyengaged in planning out the details of a projected ball at the Crown Innwhen a letter from Mr. Churchill urging his instant departure compelledhim to make a hurried return to Enscombe.Meanwhile while Emma was entertaining no doubt of her being in lovewith Frank and only wondering how deep her feeling was while she wascontent to think that Frank was very much in love with her and wasconcluding every imaginary declaration on his side with a refusal of hisproposals Mr. Elton returned to Highbury with his bride. Miss AugustaHawkins--to give Mrs. Elton her maiden name--was the younger of the twodaughters of a Bristol tradesman and was credited with having tenthousand pounds of her own. A self-important presuming familiarignorant and ill-bred woman with a little beauty and a littleaccomplishment who was always expatiating on the charms of Mr.Suckling's--her brother-in-law's--place Maple Grove she soon exciteddisgust in Emma who offended her by the scanty encouragement with whichshe received her proposals of intimacy and was herself offended by thegreat fancy which Mrs. Elton took to Jane Fairfax. Long before Emma hadforfeited her confidence she was not satisfied with expressing anatural and reasonable admiration of Jane but without solicitation orplea or privilege she must be wanting to assist and befriend her. Theill-feeling thus aroused found significant expression on the occasion ofthe long-talked-of ball at the Crown which Mr. Weston was able to giveone evening in May thanks to the settlement of the Churchills atRichmond and the consequent reappearance of Frank Churchill atHighbury. Indeed Emma met with two annoyances on that famous evening.Mr. Weston had entreated her to come early before any other personcame for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety andcomfort of the rooms and when she got there she found that quite halfthe company had come by particular desire to help Mr. Weston'sjudgment. She felt that to be the favourite and intimate of a man whohad so many intimates was not the first distinction in the scale ofvanity.The other vexing circumstance was due to the conduct of Mr. Elton whoasked by Mrs. Weston to dance with Harriet Smith declined on the groundthat he was an old married man and that his dancing days were over.Fortunately Mr. Knightley who has recently disappointed Mrs. Westonand pleased Emma by disclaiming any idea of being attached to JaneFairfax was able in some measure to redeem the situation by leadingHarriet to the set himself. Emma had no opportunity of speaking to himtill after supper and then he said to her "They aimed at wounding morethan Harriet. Emma why is it that they are your enemies" He lookedwith smiling penetration and on receiving no answer added "_She_ought not to be angry with you I suspect whatever he may be. To thatsurmise you say nothing of course but confess Emma that you did wanthim to marry Harriet." "I did" replied Emma "and they cannot forgiveme."A day or two afterwards Harriet figured as the heroine of anotherlittle scene. She was rescued by Frank Churchill from an encounter withsome gipsies and after telling Emma in a very serious tone a few dayslater that she should never marry confessed that she had come to this
comment101,resolution because the person she might prefer to marry was one sogreatly her superior in situation._IV.--Love Finds its Own Way_His own attentions his father's hints his stepmother's guardedsilence all seemed to declare that Emma was Frank Churchill's object.But while so many were devoting him to Emma and Emma herself was makinghim over to Harriet Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of someinclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax. When Mr. Knightley mentionedthese suspicions to Emma she declared them sheer imagination and saidthat she could _answer_ for there being no attachment on the side of thegentleman while he himself as if to ridicule the whole idea flirtedoutrageously with Emma on an excursion to Box Hill at which Jane waspresent and even asked the former lady to choose a wife for him. Thenext day Emma calling on Miss Bates learned that Jane who was atpresent too unwell to see her had just accepted a post as governessobtained for her by Mrs. Elton and that Frank Churchill had beensummoned to return immediately to Richmond in consequence of Mrs.Churchill's state of health. On the following day an express arrived atRandalls to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill.Emma seeing in this latter event a circumstance favourable to the unionof Frank and Harriet for Mr. Churchill independent of his wife wasfeared by nobody now only wished for some proof of the former'sattachment to her friend. She could however for the moment do nothingfor Harriet whereas she could show some attention to Jane whoseprospects were closing while Harriet's were opening. But here sheproved to be mistaken all her endeavours were to no purpose. Theinvalid refused everything that was offered no matter what itscharacter and Emma had to console herself with the thought that herintentions were good and would have satisfied even so strict aninvestigator of motives as Mr. Knightley.One morning about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's death Emma wascalled downstairs to Mr. Weston who asked her to come to Randalls asMrs. Weston wanted to see her alone. Relieved to find that the matterwas not one of illness either there or at Brunswick Square Emmaresolved to wait patiently till she could see her old friend. But whatwas her surprise on Mr. Weston leaving them together when his wiferevealed the fact that Frank and Jane had been secretly engaged sinceOctober of the previous year It was almost greater than Mrs. Weston's
comment102,relief when she learned to her joy that Emma now cared nothing at allfor Frank and so had been in no wise injured by this clandestineunderstanding the divulgence of which was due it seemed to the factthat immediately on hearing of Jane's agreement to take up the post ofgoverness Frank had gone to his uncle told him of the engagement andwith little difficulty obtained his consent to it.It was with a heavy heart that Emma went home to give Harriet the newsthat must blast her hopes of happiness once more. But again a surprisewas in store for her. Harriet had already been told by Mr. Weston andseemed to bear her misfortune quite stoically the reason being that theperson of "superior situation" whom she despaired of securing was notMr. Frank Churchill but Mr. George Knightley.Emma was not prepared for this development. It darted through her withthe speed of an arrow that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herselfWhich desirable consummation was brought about at their next interviewfor after trying to console her for the abominable conduct of FrankChurchill under the mistaken impression that that young gentleman hadsucceeded in engaging her affections Mr. Knightley proposed marriage toher and was accepted. As for Harriet she was invited at Emma'ssuggestion to spend a fortnight with Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley inBrunswick Square and there meeting Mr. Robert Martin through Mr.George Knightley's contrivance was easily persuaded to become his wife.About this same time too Mrs. Weston's husband and friends were allmade happy by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl while Emmaand Mrs. Weston were enabled to take a more lenient view of FrankChurchill's conduct thanks to a long letter which he wrote to thelatter lady in which he apologised for his equivocal conduct to Emmaand expressed his regret that those attentions should have caused suchpoignant distress to the lady whom he was shortly to make his wife. Themuch discussed pianoforte had been his gift.                                   Persuasion     Jane Austen began her last book soon after she had finished     "Emma" and completed it in August 1816. "Persuasion" is     connected with "Northanger Abbey" not only by the fact that     the two books were originally bound up in one volume and     published together two years later and are still so issued     but in the circumstance that in both stories the scene is laid     partly in Bath a health resort with which Jane Austen was     well acquainted as having been her place of residence from     the year 1801 till 1805._I.--The Vain Baronet of Kellynch Hall_Sir Walter Elliot of Kellynch Hall in Somersetshire was a man whofor his own amusement never took up any book but the Baronetage. Therehe found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distressedone there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect bycontemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents there anyunwelcome sensations derived from domestic affairs changed naturallyinto pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations ofthe last century and there if every other leaf was powerless he couldread his own history with an interest which never failed. This was thepage at which the favourite volume always opened    "ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL."     "Walter Elliot born March 1 1760 married July 15 1784     Elizabeth daughter of James Stevenson Esq. of South Park     in the county of Gloucester by which lady who died 1800 he     has issue Elizabeth born June 1 1785 Anne born August 9     1787 a still-born son November 5 1789 Mary born November     20 1791."Precisely thus had the paragraph originally stood from the printer'shands. But Sir Walter had improved it by adding for the information ofhimself and his family these words after the date of Mary's birth"Married December 16 1810 Charles son and heir of Charles MusgroveEsq. of Uppercross in the county of Somerset" and by inserting mostaccurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife.Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family
comment103,in the usual terms how it had been first settled in Cheshire howmentioned in Dugdale serving the office of High Sheriff representing aborough in three successive parliaments exertions of loyalty anddignity of baronet in the first year of Charles II. with all the Marysand Elizabeths they had married forming altogether two handsomeduodecimo pages and concluding with the arms and motto "Principalseat Kellynch Hall in the county of Somerset" and Sir Walter'shandwriting again in the finale "Heir-presumptive William WalterElliot Esq. great-grandson of the second Sir Walter."Vanity was the beginning and end of Sir Walter Elliot'scharacter--vanity of person and of situation. He had been remarkablyhandsome in his youth and at fifty-four was still a very fine man.Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did norcould the valet of any new-made lord be more delighted with the place heheld in society. He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior onlyto the blessing of a baronetcy and the Sir Walter Elliot who unitedthese gifts was the constant object of his warmest respect anddevotion.His good looks and his rank had a fair claim on his attachment since tothem he must have owed a wife of very superior character to anythingdeserved by his own. Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman sensibleand amiable whose judgment and conduct if they might be pardoned theyouthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot had never requiredindulgence afterwards. Three girls however--the two eldest sixteen andfourteen--were an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath an awful chargerather to confide to the authority of a conceited silly father.Fortunately Lady Elliot had one very intimate friend Lady Russell asensible deserving woman who had been brought by strong attachment toherself to settle close by her in the village of Kellynch and on herkindness Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance ofthe good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously givingher daughters.Elizabeth had succeeded at sixteen to all that was possible of hermother's rights and consequence and being very handsome and very likehimself her influence had always been great and they had gone ontogether most happily. His two other children were of very inferiorvalue. Mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming Mrs.Charles Musgrove but Anne with an elegance of mind and sweetness ofcharacter which must have placed her high with any people of realunderstanding was nobody with either father or sister. To Lady Russellindeed she was a most dear and highly valued god-daughter favouriteand friend. Lady Russell loved them all but it was only in Anne thatshe could fancy the mother to revive again.It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than shewas ten years before and generally speaking it is a time of life at
comment104,which scarcely any charm is lost. It was so with Elizabeth still thesame handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years agoand Sir Walter might be excused therefore in forgetting her age orat least be deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and Elizabethas blooming as ever amid the wreck of the good looks of everybody else.Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment. Shehad the consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regretsand some apprehensions. Moreover she had been disappointed by theheir-presumptive the very William Walter Elliot Esq. whose rights hadbeen so generously supported by her father. Soon after Lady Elliot'sdeath Sir Walter had sought Mr. Elliot's society and had introducedhim to Elizabeth who was quite ready to marry him. But despite theassiduity of the baronet the younger man let the acquaintance drop andmarried a rich woman of inferior birth for whom at the present timethe summer of 1814 Elizabeth was wearing black ribbons.Anne too had had her disappointment. Eight years ago before she hadlost her bloom when in fact she had been an extremely pretty girlwith gentleness modesty taste and feeling added she had fallen inlove with Captain Wentworth a young naval officer who had distinguishedhimself in the action off Domingo but her father and Lady Russell hadfrowned upon the match and persuaded chiefly by the arguments of thelatter that it would be prejudicial to the professional interests of herlover who had still his fortune to make she had rather weaklysubmitted to have the engagement broken off. But though he had angrilycast her out of his heart she still loved him having in the meantimerejected Charles Musgrove who subsequently consoled himself by marryingher sister Mary. So that when her father's embarrassed affairs compelledhim to let Kellynch Hall to Admiral Croft an eminent seaman who hadfought at Trafalgar and had happened to marry a sister of CaptainWentworth she could not help thinking with a gentle sigh as shewalked along her favourite grove "A few months more and he perhapsmay be walking here."_II.--Anne Elliot and her Old Lover_Sir Walter and Elizabeth went to Bath and settled themselves in a goodhouse in Camden Place while it was arranged that Anne should divide hertime between Uppercross Cottage--where Mr. and Mrs. Charles Musgrovelived--and Kellynch Lodge and come on from the latter house to Bathwhen Lady Russell was prepared to take her. Sir Walter had included inhis party a Mrs. Clay a young widow with whom despite the fact thatshe had freckles and a projecting tooth and was the daughter of Mr.Shepherd the family solicitor Elizabeth had recently struck up a greatfriendship. Anne had tried to warn her sister against this attractiveand seemingly designing young woman but her advice had not been takenin good part and she had to content herself with hoping that thoughher suspicion had been resented it might yet be remembered.At Uppercross she found things very little altered. TheMusgroves saw too much of one another. The two families were so
comment105,continually meeting so much in the habit of running in and out of eachother's houses at all hours that their various members inevitably foundmuch to complain of in one another's conduct. These complaints werebrought to Anne who was treated with such confidence by all partiesthat if she had not been a very discreet young lady she might haveconsiderably increased the difficulties of the situation. Mary she foundas selfish as querulous as ready to think herself ailing as lackingin sense and understanding as unable to manage her children as ever.Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he wasundoubtedly superior to his wife though neither his powers nor hisconversation were remarkable. He did nothing with much zeal but sportand his time was otherwise trifled away without benefit from books oranything else. He had however excellent spirits which never seemedmuch affected by his wife's occasional moroseness and he bore with herunreasonableness sometimes to Anne's admiration. As for the MissMusgroves Henrietta and Louisa young ladies of nineteen and twentythey were living to be fashionable happy and merry. Their dress hadevery advantage their faces were pretty their spirits good theirmanners unembarrassed and pleasant they were of consequence at homeand favourites abroad.The Crofts took possession of Kellynch Hall with true naval alertnessand naturally enough intercourse was soon established between them andthe Musgroves. Soon it was known that the admiral's brother-in-lawCaptain Wentworth had come to stop with them and one day he made theinevitable call at the Cottage on his way to shoot with Charles. It wassoon over. Anne's eyes half met his a bow a courtesy passed. He talkedto Mary said all that was right said something to the Miss Musgrovesenough to mark an easy footing. Charles showed himself at the windowall was ready their visitor had bowed and was gone the Miss Musgroveswere gone too suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the villagewith the sportsmen.She had seen him they had met. They had been once more in the sameroom. Now how were his sentiments to be read On one question she wassoon spared all suspense for after the Miss Musgroves had returned andfinished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneousinformation from Mary "Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by youAnne though he was so attentive to me. Henrietta asked him what hethought of you. 'You were so altered he should not have known youagain' he said."Doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge for he was notaltered or not for the worse. No the years which had destroyed her
comment106,bloom had only given him a more glowing manly open look in no respectlessening his personal advantages."Altered beyond his knowledge." Frederick Wentworth had used such wordsor something like them but without an idea that they would be carriedround to her. He had thought her wretchedly altered and in the firstmoment of appeal had spoken as he felt. He had not forgiven AnneElliot. She had used him ill--deserted and disappointed him and worsein doing so had shown weakness and timidity. He had been most warmlyattached to her and had never seen a woman since whom he thought herequal. It was now his object to marry. He was rich and being turned onshore intended to settle as soon as he could be tempted. "Yes here Iam Sophia" he said to his sister "quite ready to make a foolishmatch. Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for the asking. Alittle beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navy andI am a lost man."It looked indeed as if he would soon be lost either to Louisa or toHenrietta. It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day. TheMusgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come and asfor Henrietta and Louisa they both seemed so entirely occupied by himthat nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect goodwillbetween themselves could have made it credible that they were notdecided rivals. Indeed Mr. Charles Hayter a young curate with someexpectations who was a cousin of the Musgroves began to get uneasy.Previous to Captain Wentworth's introduction there had been aconsiderable appearance of attachment between Henrietta and himself butnow he seemed to be very much forgotten._III.--Love-making at Lyme Regis_At this interesting juncture the scene of action was changed fromUppercross to Lyme Regis owing to Captain Wentworth's receipt of aletter from his old friend Captain Harville announcing his beingsettled at this latter place. Captain Wentworth after a visit to LymeRegis gave so interesting an account of the adjacent country that theyoung people were all wild to see it. Accordingly it was agreed to staythe night there and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner.They found Captain Harville a tall dark man with a sensiblebenevolent countenance a little lame but unaffected warm andobliging. Mrs. Harville a degree less polished than her husband seemedto have the same good feelings and cordiality while Captain Benwickwho was the youngest of the three naval officers and a comparativelylittle man had a pleasing face and a melancholic air just as he oughtto have. He had been engaged to Captain Harville's sister and was nowmourning her loss. They had been a year or two waiting for fortune andpromotion. Fortune came his prize-money as lieutenant being greatpromotion too came at last but Fanny Harville did not live to knowit. She had died the preceding summer while he was at sea and thefriendship between him and the Harvilles having been augmented by the
comment107,event which closed all their views of alliance he was now living withthem entirely. A man of retiring manners and of sedentary pursuits witha decided taste for reading he was drawn a good deal to Anne Elliotduring this excursion and talked to her of poetry of Scott and Byronof "Marmion" and "The Lady of the Lake" of "The Giaour" and "The Brideof Abydos." He repeated with such feeling the various lines of Byronwhich imaged a broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchedness andlooked so entirely as if he meant to be understood that Anne venturedto recommend to him a larger allowance of prose in his daily study.Another interesting person whom the Uppercross party met at Lyme was Mr.Elliot. He did not recognise Anne and her friends or did they till hehad left the town find out who he was but he was obviously struck withAnne and gazed at her with a degree of earnest admiration which shecould not be insensible of. She was looking remarkably well her veryregular very pretty features having the bloom and freshness of youthrestored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion andby the animation of eye which it had also produced.It was evident that the gentleman admired her exceedingly. CaptainWentworth looked round at her in a way which showed his noticing of it.He gave her a momentary glance a glance of brightness which seemed tosay "That man is struck with you and even I at this moment seesomething like Anne Elliot again."But the folly of Louisa Musgrove and the consequences that attended itsoon obliterated from Anne's memory all such recollections as these.Louisa who was walking with Captain Wentworth persuaded him to jumpher down the steps on the Lower Cob. Contrary to his advice she ran upthe steps to be jumped down again and being too precipitate by asecond fell on the pavement and was taken up senseless. Fortunately nobones were broken the only injury was to the head and Captain and Mrs.Harville insisting on her being taken to their house she recoveredhealth so steadily that before Anne and Lady Russell left Kellynch Lodgefor Bath there was talk of the possibility of her being able to beremoved to Uppercross.When the accident occurred Captain Wentworth's attitude was very muchthat of the lover. "Oh God that I had not given way at the fatalmoment" he cried. "Had I but done as I ought But so eager and soresolute dear sweet Louisa"Anne feared there could not be a doubt as to what would follow therecovery but she was amused to hear Charles Musgrove tell how muchCaptain Benwick admired herself--"elegance sweetness beauty" Ohthere was no end to Miss Elliot's charmsAnother surprise awaited her at Bath where she found her father and
comment108,sister Elizabeth happy in the submission and society of theheir-presumptive. He had explained away all the appearance of neglect onhis own side as originating in misapprehension. He had never had an ideaof throwing himself off he had feared that he was thrown off anddelicacy had kept him silent. These explanations having been made SirWalter took him by the hand affirming that "Mr. Elliot was better tolook at than most men and that he had no objection to being seen withhim anywhere."The gentleman called one evening soon after Anne's arrival in the townand his little start of surprise on being introduced to her showed thathe was not more astonished than delighted at meeting in the characterof Sir Walter's daughter the young lady who had so strongly struck hisfancy at Lyme. He stopped an hour and his tone his expressions hischoice of subject all showed the operation of a sensible discerningmind.Still Anne could not understand what his object was in seeking thisreconciliation. Even the engagement of Louisa Musgrove to CaptainBenwick which was announced to her by Mary about a month later seemedmore susceptible of explanation--had not the young couple been throwntogether for weeks--than this determination of Mr. Elliot to becomefriends with relations from whom he could derive no possible advantage._IV.--Love Triumphant_Following close on the news of Louisa's engagement came the arrival atBath of Admiral and Mrs. Croft. He had come for the cure of his goutand he was soon followed by Captain Wentworth who for the first timesince their second meeting deliberately sought Anne out at a concertwhich she and her people were attending. The most significant part oftheir conversation was his comment on Louisa's engagement to CaptainBenwick. He frankly confessed he could not understand it as far as itconcerned Benwick."A man like him in his situation with a heart pierced wounded almostbroken Fanny Harville was a very superior person and his attachment toher was indeed attachment. A man does not recover from such a devotionof the heart to such a woman. He ought not he does not."But the captain was prevented from saying much more by the assiduousattention which Mr. Elliot paid to her at this concert."Very long" said he "has the name of Anne Elliot possessed a charmover my fancy and if I dared I would breathe my wishes that the namemight never change."Such language might almost be taken to be a proposal but Anne was toomuch interested in watching Captain Wentworth to pay much attention toit.She had still in mind the words which her sometime lover had spoken atthe concert when a visit she had paid to an invalid friend an oldschoolfellow of hers called Mrs. Smith gave her complete enlightenmentas to the character and present objects of Mr. Elliot. Mrs. Smith whowas a widow and whose husband had been a bosom friend of Mr. Elliot'sdescribed him as "a man without heart or conscience a designing warycold-blooded being who thinks only of himself who for his own interestor ease would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could beperpetrated without risk of damaging his general character." She toldhow he had encouraged her husband to whom he was under greatobligations to indulge in the most ruinous expense and then on hisdeath caused her endless difficulties and distress by refusing to actas his executor. She also informed Anne that he had married his firstwife whom he treated badly entirely on account of her fortune andthat though among the present reasons for continuing the acquaintancewith his relations was a genuine attachment to herself his originalintention in seeking a reconciliation with Sir Walter had been to securefor himself the reversion of the baronetcy by preventing the holder ofthe title from falling into the snares of Mrs. Clay.The next day a party of the Musgroves appeared at Camden Place. Mrs.Musgrove senior had some old friends at Bath whom she wanted to seeMrs. Charles Musgrove could not bear to be left behind in any excursionwhich her husband was taking Henrietta who had arrived at anunderstanding with Mr. Charles Hayter had come to buy wedding clothes
comment109,for herself and Louisa and Captain Harville had come on business. Itwas on a visit to the Musgroves who were stopping at the White HartHotel that Anne had a momentous conversation with the last-namedperson. The captain had been reverting to the topic of his friendBenwick's engagement and Anne had been saying that women did not forgetas readily as men."No no" said Harville "it is not man's nature to forget. I will notallow it to be more man's nature than woman's to be inconstant and toforget those they do love or have loved. I believe the reverse. Ibelieve in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental andthat as our bodily frames are stronger than yours so are our feelings.""Your feelings may be the stronger" replied Anne "but the same spiritof analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the more tender.Man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived which exactlyexplains my view of the nature of their attachment."Captain Wentworth who was sitting down at a writing-table in anotherpart of the room engaged in correspondence seemed very much interestedin this conversation and a few minutes later he placed before Annewith eyes of glowing entreaty a letter addressed to "Miss A. E.""I offer myself to you again" he wrote "with a heart even more yourown than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago. Dare notsay that man forgets sooner than woman that his love has an earlierdeath I have loved none but you."To such a declaration there could be but one answer and soon FrederickWentworth and Anne Elliot were exchanging again those feelings and thosepromises which once before had seemed to secure everything but whichhad been followed by so many years of division and estrangement.This time there was no opposition to the engagement. Captain Wentworth'swealth personal appearance and well-sounding name enabled Sir Walterto prepare his pen with a very good grace for the insertion of themarriage in the volume of honour.As for Mr. Elliot the news of his cousin Anne's engagement burst on himwith unexpected suddenness. He soon quitted Bath and on Mrs. Clay'sleaving it shortly afterwards and being next heard of as establishedunder his protection in London it was evident how double a game he hadbeen playing and how determined he was to save himself at all eventsfrom being cut out by one artful woman at least.                                   HONOR DE BALZACEugnie Grandet     Honor de Balzac was born May 20 1799 at Tours in France     and died at Paris Aug. 18 1850. His early life was filled     with hard work and oppressed by poverty. He attained success     by the publication of "Les Derniers Chouans" in 1829 and he     soon established his fame as the leader of realistic fiction.     In spite of frequent coarseness he stands for all time as a     great writer by reason of his powers of character analysis.     "Eugnie Grandet" is justly one of the most famous of     Balzac's novels. As a study of avarice in the character of     old Grandet it is superb and the picture of manners in the     country town of Saumur is painted as only a supreme artist
comment110,     like Balzac could paint it. The pathos of Eugnie's wasted     life the long suffering of Mme. Grandet the craft and     cunning of the Des Grassins and the Cruchots the fidelity of     Nanon and the frank egotism of Charles Grandet--all these     things combine to make the book a masterpiece of French     fiction. "Eugnie Grandet" was written in the full vigour of     Balzac's genius in 1833 and was published in the first volume     of "Scenes of Provincial Life" in 1834 and finally included     in the "Human Comedy" in 1843._I.--The Rich Miser of Saumur_The town of Saumur is old-fashioned and in every way "provincial." Itshouses are dark within its shops undecorated recall the workshops ofthe Middle Ages. Its inhabitants gossip freely according to the fashionof country towns and the arrival of a stranger in the town is animportant item of news. The trade of Saumur depends upon the vineyardsof the district. The prosperity of landowners vinegrowers coopers andinnkeepers rises or falls according to whether the season is good or badfor the grapes.A certain house in Saumur larger and more sombre than most and oncethe residence of nobility belonged to M. Grandet.This M. Grandet was a master cooper in 1789 a good man of business witha remarkable head for accounts. He prospered in the Revolution boughtthe confiscated Church lands at a low price married the daughter of awealthy timber merchant was made mayor under the consulate becameMonsieur Grandet when the empire was established and every year grewwealthier and more miserly.In 1817 M. Grandet was 68 his wife 47 and their only child Eugniewas 21.A careful cunning silent man was M. Grandet who loved his gold and toget the better in a bargain beyond all else. He cultivated 100 acres ofvineyard had thirteen little farms an old abbey and 127 acres ofgrazing land and owned the house he lived in. The town estimated oldGrandet's income to be five or six million francs but only two peoplewere in a position to guess with any chance of probability and thesewere M. Cruchot the notary and M. des Grassins the banker and theydisclosed no secrets.Both M. Cruchot and M. des Grassins were men of considerable importancein Saumur and enjoyed the right of entry to M. Grandet's house--aprivilege extended to only a very few of their neighbours.
comment111,There was rivalry between these two families of the Cruchots and DesGrassins rivalry for the hand of Grandet's daughter Eugnie. Cruchot'snephew was a rising lawyer already at the age of thirty-three apresident of the court of first instance and Cruchot's brother was anabb of Tours. The hopes of the Cruchots were centred on the successfulmarriage of the nephew who called himself Cruchot de Bonfons after anestate he had bought with Grandet's heiress.Mme. des Grassins was equally hopeful and indefatigable on behalf of herson Adolphe.The whole town knew of the struggle between these two families andwatched it with interest. Would Mlle. Grandet marry M. Adolphe desGrassins or M. le Prsident There were others who declared the oldcooper was rich enough to marry his daughter to a peer in France.With all his wealth and the fortune his wife brought him M. Grandetlived as meanly and cheaply as he could. His house was cold and drearyand his table was supplied with poultry eggs butter and corn by histenants. M. Grandet never paid visits or invited people to dinner.One servant Nanon a big strong woman of five feet eight inches didall the work of the house the cooking and washing the baking andcleaning and watched over her master's interests with an absolutefidelity. The strength of Nanon appealed to M. Grandet when he was onthe lookout for a housekeeper before his marriage and the girl out ofwork and wretched had never lost her gratitude for having been takeninto his service. For twenty-eight years Nanon had worked early and latefor the Grandets and on a yearly wage of seventy livres had accumulatedmore money than any other servant in Saumur. She was one of the familyspending her evenings in the sitting-room of her employers where asingle candle was all that was allowed for illumination. M. Grandet alsodecided that no fire must be lit in the sitting-room from April 1 toOctober 31 and every morning he went into the kitchen and doled out thebread sugar and other provisions for the day to Nanon and candles tohis daughter.As for Mme. Grandet her gentleness and meekness could not stand upagainst her husband's force of character. She had brought more than300000 francs to her husband and yet had no money save an occasionalsix francs for pocket-money and the only certain source of income wasfour or five louis which Grandet made the Belgian merchants who boughthis wine pay over and above the stipulated price. Often enough he wouldborrow some of this money even. Mme. Grandet was too gentle to revoltbut her pride forbade her ever asking a sou from her husband. With herdaughter she attended to the household linen and found compensation forthe unhappiness of her lot in the consolations of religion and also inthe company of Eugnie. It never occurred to M. Grandet that his wifesuffered or had reason to suffer. He was making money every year his
comment112,riches increased. He paid for sittings in church and gave his daughterfive francs a month for a dress allowance. That his wife hardly everleft the house except occasionally to go to church that her dress wasinvariably the same and that she never asked him for anything nevertroubled M. Grandet. Avarice was his consuming passion and it wassatisfactory to him that no one attempted to cross him.Twice a year on her birthday and on the day of her patron saintEugnie received some rare gold coin from her father and then he wouldtake pleasure in looking at her store--for these coins were not to bespent. Old M. Grandet liked to think that his daughter was learning toappreciate gold and that in giving her these precious coins he was notparting with his money but only putting it in another box._II.--Eugnie's Springtime of Love_On Eugnie's twenty-third birthday November 1819 the threeCruchots--the notary the abb and the magistrate--and the three DesGrassins--M. des Grassins Mme. des Grassins and their son Adolphe--hastened to pay their respects to the heiress as soon as dinner wasover. Mr. Grandet in honour of the occasion lit a second candle in thesitting-room. "It is Eugnie's birthday and we must have anillumination" he remarked. The Cruchots all brought handsome bouquetsof flowers for Eugnie but their gifts were eclipsed by a showy workboxfitted with trumpery gilded silver fittings which Mme. des Grassinspresented and which filled Eugnie with delight. "Adolphe brought itfrom Paris" whispered Mme. des Grassins in the girl's ear. Old Grandetquite understood that both families were in pursuit of his daughter forthe sake of her fortune and made up his mind that neither of themshould have her.They all sat down to play lotto at half-past eight except old Grandetwho never played any game. Just as Mme. Grandet had won a pool ofsixteen sous a heavy knock at the front door startled everybody in theroom. Nanon took up one of the candles and went to the door followed byGrandet. Presently they returned with a young man good-looking andfashionably dressed. This was Charles Grandet the son of the oldcooper's brother a merchant in Paris. The young man brought a good manytrunks and while Nanon saw to the bestowal of his luggage all thelotto players looked at the visitor. Old Grandet took the only remainingcandle from the table to read a long letter which his nephew hadbrought. Charles had set off from Paris at his father's bidding to pay avisit to his uncle at Saumur. He was a dandy and his appearance was instriking contrast to the attire of the Cruchots and the Des Grassins.Moreover he already had had a love affair with a great lady whom hecalled Annette and he was a good shot. Altogether Charles Grandet wasa vain and selfish youth conscious of his superiority over theunfashionable provincials of Saumur but determined at all costs toenjoy himself as best he could.As for Eugnie it seemed to her that she had never seen such a perfectgentleman as this cousin from Paris and at the risk of incurring herfather's wrath succeeded in persuading Nanon to do what she could to
comment113,make things comfortable for their guest in the cold and dreary house.Nanon was milking the cow when Eugnie preferred her kindly andconsiderate request and the faithful serving-maid at once obliginglypromised to save a little cream from her master's supply of milk. TheCruchots and Des Grassins retired discomfited before the presence ofCharles Grandet. The young Parisian brought up in luxury by his fathercould not understand why he should have been sent to this outlandishplace and he was the more mystified by his uncle telling him they wouldtalk over "important business" on the morrow. Then indeed in plain andbrutal words he learnt the contents of the fatal letter he had broughtfrom his father. It was twenty-three years since old Grandet had seenhis brother in Paris but this brother had become a rich man too ofthat old Grandet was aware. And now Victor-Ange-Guillaume Grandet wroteto him from Paris saying "By the time that this letter is in yourhands I shall cease to exist. The failure of my stockbroker and mynotary has ruined me and while I owe nearly four million francs myassets are only a quarter of my debts. I cannot survive the disgrace ofbankruptcy. I know you cannot satisfy my creditors but you can be afather to my unhappy child Charles who is now alone in the world. Layeverything before him and tell him that in my work he can restore thefortune he has lost. My failure is due neither to dishonesty nor tocarelessness but to causes beyond my control."Old Grandet told his nephew plainly that his father was dead and evenshowed him a paragraph already in the papers referring to the ruin andsuicide of the unhappy man--so quickly is such news spread abroad.For the moment his penniless state was nothing to the young man theloss of his father was the only grief.Old Grandet let him alone and in a day or two Charles gathered upstrength to face the situation.Mme. Grandet and Eugnie were full of tender sympathy for the unhappyyoung man and this sympathy in Eugnie's case ripened into love. Oneday when Eugnie passed her cousin's chamber the door stood ajar shethrust it open and saw that Charles had fallen asleep in his chair. Sheentered and found out from a letter her cousin had written to Annettewhich she read as it lay on the table that he was in want of money--forold Grandet was resolved to do nothing for his nephew beyond paying hispassage to Nantes. The next night she brought him all her store of goldcoins worth six thousand francs. Her confidence and devoted affectiontouched Charles deeply. He accepted the money and in return gave intoher keeping a small leather box containing portraits of his father andmother richly set in gold. Eugnie promised to guard this box until hereturned.For it was decided that Charles Grandet must go to the Indies to seekhis fortune. He sold his jewels and finery and paid his personal debtsin Paris and waited on at Saumur till the ship should be ready to sailfor Nantes.And in those few weeks came the springtime of love for Eugnie.Old Grandet was too busy to trouble about his nephew who was so shortlyto be got rid of and both Nanon and Mme. Grandet liked and pities theyoung man.Charles Grandet on his side was conscious that his Parisian friendswould not have shown him a like kindness and the purity and truth ofEugnie's love were something he had not hitherto experienced.The cousins would snatch a few moments together in the early morningand once only a few days before his departure they met in the longdark passage at the foot of the staircase. "Dear cousin I cannot expectto return for many years" Charles said sadly. "We must not considerourselves bound in any way.""You love me" was all Eugnie asked. And on his reply she added "ThenI will wait for you Charles."Presently his arms were round her waist. Eugnie made no resistanceand pressed to his heart received her lover's kiss.
comment114,"Dear Eugnie a cousin is better than a brother he can marry you"said Charles.Thus the lovers vowed themselves to each other. Then came the terriblehour of parting and Charles Grandet sailed from Nantes for the Indiesand the old house at Saumur suddenly seemed to Eugnie to have becomevery empty and bare indeed._III.--M. Grandet's Discovery_Grandet on the advice of M. Cruchot the notary saved the honour ofhis dead brother. There was no act of bankruptcy. M. Cruchot to gainfavour with old Grandet proposed to go to Paris to look after the deadman's affairs but suggested the payment of expenses. It was M. desGrassins however who went to Paris for he undertook to make nocharge and the banker not only attended to Guillaume Grandet'screditors but stayed on in Paris--having been made a deputy--and fellin love with an actress. Adolphe joined his father and achieved anequally unpleasant reputation.The property of Guillaume Grandet realised enough money to pay thecreditors a dividend of 47 per cent. They agreed that they woulddeposit upon certain conditions their bills with an accredited notaryand each one said to himself that Grandet of Saumur would pay.Grandet of Saumur however did not pay. Endless delays wereforthcoming and Des Grassins was always holding out promises that werenot fulfilled.As years went by some of the creditors gave up all hope of paymentothers died till at the end of five years the deficit stood at1200000 francs.In the meantime a terrible blow had fallen on Mine. Grandet. On January1 1820 old Grandet according to his wont presented his daughter witha gold coin and asked to see her store of gold pieces.All Eugnie would tell him was that her money was gone. In vain the oldman stormed. Eugnie kept on saying "I am of age the money was mine."Grandet raved at his wife who weary and ill gave him no satisfaction.In fact Mine. Grandet's character had become stronger through herdaughter's trouble and she refused to support her husband's angrydemands.Then old Grandet ordered Eugnie to retire to her own apartment. "Do youhear what I say Go" he shouted.Soon all the town knew that Eugnie was a prisoner in her own roomseeing no one but her mother and old Nanon and public opinion knowingnothing of the cause of the quarrel blamed the old cooper. For sixmonths this state of things lasted and Mine. Grandet's illness becamesteadily worse. M. Cruchot the notary warned old Grandet that in theevent of his wife's death he would have to give an account to Eugnieof her mother's share in the joint estate and that Eugnie could thenif she chose demand her mother's fortune to which she would beentitled.This seriously alarmed the avaricious old cooper and he made up hismind to a reconciliation for his wife assured him she would never getbetter while Eugnie was treated so badly. Eugnie and her mother weretalking of Charles from whom no letter had come and getting whatpleasure they could from looking at the portraits of his parents whenold Grandet burst into the room. Catching sight of the gold fittings hesnatched up the dressing-case and would have wrenched off the precious
comment115,metal. "Father father" Eugnie called out "this case is not yours itis not mine it is a sacred trust It belongs to my unhappy cousin. Donot pull it to pieces"Old Grandet took no notice."Oh have pity you are killing me" said the mother.Eugnie caught up a knife and her cry brought Nanon on the scene."Father if you cut away a single piece of gold I shall stab myself.You are killing my mother and you will kill me too."Old Grandet for once was frightened. He tried to make it up with hiswife he kissed Eugnie and even promised that Eugnie should marry hercousin if she wanted to.Mme. Grandet lingered till October and then died. "There is nohappiness to be had except in heaven some day you will understandthat" she said to her daughter just before she passed away.M. Cruchot was called in after Mine. Grandet's death and in hispresence Eugnie agreed to sign a deed renouncing her claim to hermother's fortune while her father lived. She signed it without makingany objection to old Grandet's great relief and he promised to allowher 100 francs a month. But the old man himself was failing. Bit by bithe relinquished his many activities but lived on till seven years hadpassed. Then he died his eyes kindling at the end at the sight of thepriest's sacred vessels of silver. His brother's creditors were stillunpaid. Eugnie was informed by M. Cruchot that her property amounted to17000000 francs. "Where can my cousin be" she asked herself. "If onlywe knew where the young gentleman was I would set off myself and findhim" Nanon said to her. The poor heiress was very lonely. The faithfulNanon now fifty-nine married Antoine Cornoiller the bailiff of theestates and these two who had known one another for years lived inthe house.The Cruchots still hoped to marry M. le Prsident to Eugnie and everybirthday the magistrate brought a handsome bouquet. But the heart ofEugnie remained steadfast to her cousin."Ah Nanon" she would say "why has he never written to me once allthese years"Mme. des Grassins unwilling to see the triumph of her old rivals theCruchots went about saying that the heiress of the Grandet millionswould marry a peer of France rather than a magistrate. Eugnie howeverthought neither of the peer nor of the magistrate. She gave awayenormous sums in charity and lived on quietly in the dreary old house.
comment116,Her wealth brought her no comfort her only treasures were the twoportraits left in her charge. Yet she went on loving and believedherself loved in return._IV.--The Honour of the Grandets_Charles Grandet in the course of eight years met with considerablesuccess in his trading ventures. He saw very quickly that the way tomake money in the tropics as in Europe was to go in for buying andselling men and so he plunged into the slave trade of Africa and underthe name of Carl Shepherd was known in the East Indies in the UnitedStates and on the African coasts. His plan was to get rich as speedilyas possible and then return to Paris and live respected. For atime--that is on his first voyage--the thought of Eugnie gave himinfinite pleasure but soon all recollection of Saumur was blotted outand his cousin became merely a person to whom he owed 6000 francs.In 1827 Charles returned to Bordeaux with 1900000 francs in golddust. On board the ship he became very intimate with the d'Aubrions anold aristocratic but impoverished family. Mme. d'Aubrion was anxious tosecure Charles Grandet for her only daughter and they all travelled toParis together. Mme. d'Aubrion pointed out to Grandet that her influencewould get him a court appointment with title of Comte d'Aubrion andAnnette with whom Grandet took counsel approved the alliance.Des Grassins hearing of the wanderer's return called and anxious toget some remuneration for all the trouble he had taken explained that300000 francs were still owing to his father's creditors. But CharlesGrandet answered coolly that he had nothing to do with his father'sdebts.Des Grassins however wrote to his wife that he would yet make the deadGuillaume Grandet a bankrupt and that would stop the marriage and Mme.des Grassins showed the letter to Eugnie.Eugnie had already heard from her cousin. Charles Grandet sent a chequefor 8000 francs asked for the return of his dressing-case andcasually mentioned that he was going to make a brilliant marriage withMlle. d'Aubrion for whom he admitted he had not the slightestaffection.This was the shipwreck of all Eugnie's hopes--the utter and completeruin."My mother was right" she said weeping. "To suffer and then die--thatis our lot"That same evening when M. Cruchot de Bonfons the magistrate called onEugnie she promised to marry him on condition that he claimed none ofthe rights of marriage over her and that he would immediately go andsettle all her uncle's creditors in full.M. de Bonfons only too thankful to win the heiress of the Grandetmillions on any terms agreed and set off at once for Paris with acheque for 1500000 francs. He carried a letter from Eugnie to CharlesGrandet a letter that contained no word of reproach but announced thefull discharge of his father's debts.Charles was astonished to hear from M. de Bonfons of his forthcomingmarriage with Eugnie and he was dumfounded when the president told himthat Mlle. Grandet possessed 17000000 francs.Mme. d'Aubrion interrupted the interview her husband's objection toGrandet's marriage with his daughter was removed with the payment of thelong-standing creditors and the restoration of the family honour of theGrandets.M. de Bonfons who now dropped the name of Cruchot married Eugnie andshortly afterwards was made Councillor to the Court Royal at Angers. Hisloyalty to the government was rewarded with further office. M. deBonfons became deputy of Saumur and then dreaming of higher honoursperhaps a peerage he died.M. de Bonfons always respected his wife's request that they should liveapart with remarkable cunning he had drafted the marriage contract inwhich "In case there was no issue of the marriage husband and wifebequeathed to each other all their property without exception or
comment117,reservation." Death disappointed his schemes. Mme. de Bonfons was left awidow three years after marriage with an income of 800000 livres.She is a beautiful woman still but pale and sorrowful. In spite of herincome she lives on in the old house and cold and sunless it bears alikeness to her own life. Spending little on herself Mme. de Bonfonsgives away large sums in succouring the unfortunate but she is verylonely--without husband children or kindred. She dwells in the worldbut is not of it.                                   Old Goriot     "Old Goriot" or to give it its French title "Le Pre     Goriot" is one of the series of novels to which Balzac gave     the title of "The Comedy of Human Life." It is a comedy     mingled with lurid tragic touches of society in the French     capital in the early decades of the nineteenth century. The     leading character in this story is of course Old Goriot and     the passion which dominates him is that of paternity. In the     picture which Balzac draws of Parisian life from the sordid     boarding-house to the luxurious mansions of the gilded     aristocracy in the days of the Bourbon Restoration the author     exhibits that tendency to over-description for which he was     criticised by his contemporaries and to dwell too much on     petty details. It may be urged however that it is the     cumulative effect of these minute touches that is necessary     for the true realisation of character._I.--In a Paris Boarding-House_Madame Vauquer ne Conflans is an elderly lady who for forty yearspast has kept a Parisian middle-class boarding-house situated in theRue Neuve Sainte-Genevive between the Latin Quarter and the FaubourgSaint Marcel. This pension known under the name of the Maison Vauquerreceives men as well as women--young men and old but hitherto scandalhas never attacked the moral principles on which the respectableestablishment has been conducted. Moreover for more than thirty yearsno young woman has been seen in the house and if any young man everlived there it was because his family were able to make him only a veryslender allowance. Nevertheless in 1819 the date at which this dramabegins a poor young girl was found there.The Maison Vauquer is of three stories with attic chambers and a tinygarden at the back. The ground floor consists of a parlour lighted bytwo windows looking upon the street. Nothing could be more depressingthan this chamber which is used as the sitting-room. It is furnishedwith chairs the seats of which are covered with strips of alternatedull and shining horsehair stuff while in the centre is a round tablewith a marble top. The room exhales a smell for which there is no namein any language except that of _odour de pension_. And yet if youcompare it with the dining-room which adjoins you will find thesitting-room as elegant and as perfumed as a lady's boudoir. Theremisery reigns without a redeeming touch of poesie--poverty penetratingconcentrated rasping. This room appears at its best when at seven inthe morning Madame Vauquer preceded by her cat enters it from hersleeping chamber. She wears a tulle cap under which hangs awry a frontof false hair her gaping slippers flop as she walks across the room.Her features are oldish and flabby from their midst springs a nose likethe beak of a parrot. Her small fat hands her person plump as a churchrat her bust too full and tremulous are all in harmony with the room.About fifty years of age Madame Vauquer looks as most women do who say
comment118,that they have had misfortunes.At the date when this story opens there were seven boarders in thehouse. The first floor contained the two best suites of rooms. MadameVauquer occupied the small and the other was let to Madame Couture thewidow of a paymaster in the army of the French Republic. She had withher a very young girl named Victorine Taillefer. On the second floorone apartment was tenanted by an old gentleman named Poiret the otherby a man of about forty years of age who wore a black wig dyed hiswhiskers gave out that he was a retired merchant and called himselfMonsieur Vautrin. The third story was divided into four single rooms ofwhich one was occupied by an old maid named Mademoiselle Michonneau andanother by an aged manufacturer of vermicelli who allowed himself to becalled "Old Goriot." The two remaining rooms were allotted to a medicalstudent known as Bianchon and to a law student named Eugne deRastignac. Above the third story were a loft where linen was dried andtwo attic rooms in one of which slept the man of all work Christopheand in the other the fat cook Sylvie.The desolate aspect of the interior of the establishment repeated itselfin the shabby attire of the boarders. Mademoiselle Michonneau protectedher weak eyes with a shabby green silk shade mounted on brass wirewhich would have scared the Angel of Pity. Although the play of passionshad ravished her features she retained certain traces of a finecomplexion which suggested that the figure conserved some fragments ofbeauty. Poiret was a human automaton who had earned a pension bymechanical labour as a government functionary.Mademoiselle Victorine Taillefer was of a sickly paleness like a girlin feeble health but her grey-black eyes expressed the sweetness andresignation of a Christian. Her dress simple and cheap betrayed heryouthful form. Happy she might have been beautiful for happinessimparts a poetic charm to women as dress is the artifice of it. If lovehad ever given sparkle to her eyes Victorine would have been able tohold her own with the fairest of her compeers. Her father believed hehad reason to doubt his paternity though she loved him with passionatetenderness and after making her a yearly allowance of six hundredfrancs he disinherited her in favour of his only son who was to be thesole successor to his millions. Madame Couture was a distant relation ofVictorine's mother who had died in her arms and she had brought up theorphan as her own daughter in a strictly pious fashion taking her withrigid regularity to mass and confession.Eugne de Rastignac the eldest son of a poor baron of Angoulme was acharacteristic son of the South. His complexion was clear hair blackeyes blue. His figure manner and habitual poses proved that he was ascion of a noble family and that his early education had been based onaristocratic traditions. The connecting link between these twoindividuals and the other boarders was Vautrin--the man of forty withthe dyed whiskers. He was one of that sort of men who are familiarlydescribed as "jolly good fellows." His face furrowed with prematurewrinkles showed signs of hardness which belied his insinuating address.He was invariably obliging with a breezy cheerfulness though at timesthere was a steely expression in the eyes which inspired hisfellow-boarders with a sense of fear. He knew or guessed the affairs ofeverybody in the house but no one could divine his real business or hismost inmost thoughts._II.--The Beginnings of the Tragedy_Such a household ought to offer and did present in miniature theelements of a complete society. Among the inmates there was as in the
comment119,world at large one poor discouraged creature--a butt on whom mockingpleasantries were rained. This patient sufferer was the old vermicellimaker Goriot. Six years before he had come to live at the MaisonVauquer having so he said retired from business. He dressedhandsomely wore a gold watch with thick gold chain and sealsflourished a gold snuff-box and when Madame Vauquer insinuated that hewas a gallant he smiled with the complacency of vanity tickled. Amongthe china and silver articles with which he decorated his sitting-roomwere a dish and porringer on the cover of which were figuresrepresenting two doves billing and cooing."That" said Goriot "is the present which my wife made to me on thefirst anniversary of our wedding-day. Poor dear she bought it with thelittle savings she hoarded before our marriage. Look you madame Iwould rather scratch the ground with my nails for a living than partwith that porringer. God be praised however I shall be able to drinkmy coffee out of this dish every morning during the rest of my days. Icannot complain. I have on the shelf as the saying is plenty of bakedbread for a long time to come."At the close of his first year Goriot began to practise littleeconomies at the end of the second he removed his rooms to the secondfloor and did without a fire all the winter. This although as MadameVauquer's prying eyes had seen Goriot's name appeared in the list ofstate funds for a sum representing an income of from eight to tenthousand francs. Henceforth she denounced him to the other paying-guestsas an unprincipled old libertine who lavished his enormous income fromthe funds on unknown youthful charmers. The boarders agreed and whentwo young ladies in the most fashionable and costly attire visited himin succession in a semi-stealthy manner their suspicions as theybelieved were confirmed. On one occasion Sylvie followed Old Goriotand his beautiful visitor to a side street and saw that there was asplendid carriage waiting and that she got into it. When challenged uponthe point the old man meekly declared that they were his daughtersthough he never disclosed that their occasional visits were paid only towheedle money from him.The years passed and with the gentleness of a broken spirit beatendown to the docility of misery Goriot curtailed his personal expensesand again removed his lodgings this time to the third floor. His dressturned shabbier with each ascending grade his diamonds gold snuff-boxand jewels disappeared. He grew thinner in person his face which hadonce the beaming roundness of a well-to-do middle-class gentlemanbecame furrowed with wrinkles. Lines appeared in his forehead his jawsgrew gaunt and sharp and at the end of the fourth year he bore nolonger the likeness of his former self. He was now a wan worn-outseptuagenarian--stupid vacillating.Eugne de Rastignac had ambitions not only to win distinction as alawyer but also to play a part in the aristocratic society of Paris. Heobserved the influence which women exert upon society and at hissuggestion his aunt Madame de Marcillac who lived with his father inthe old family chteau near Angoulme and who had been at court in thedays before the French Revolution wrote to one of her great relativesthe Viscomtesse de Beausant one of the queens of Parisian societyasking her to give kindly recognition to her nephew. On the strength of
comment120,that letter Eugne was invited to a ball at the mansion of theviscomtesse in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. The viscomtesse becameinterested in him especially as she was suffering from the desertion ofthe Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto a Portuguese nobleman who had been long herlover and stood sponsor for him in society. At the Faubourg Eugne metthe Duchesse de Langeais from whom he learned the history of OldGoriot."During the Revolution" said the duchesse "Goriot was a flour andvermicelli merchant and being president of his section was behind thescenes. When a great scarcity of food was at hand he made his fortune byselling his goods for ten times what they cost him. He had but onepassion he loved his daughters and by endowing each of them with a dotof eight hundred thousand francs he married the eldest Anastasie tothe Count de Restaud and the youngest Delphine to the Baron deNucingen a rich German financier. During the Empire his daughterssometimes asked their father to visit them but after the Restorationthe old man became an annoyance to his sons-in-law. He saw that hisdaughters were ashamed of him he made the sacrifice which only a fathercan and banished himself from their homes. There is" continued theduchesse "something in these Goriot sisters even more shocking thantheir neglect of their father for whose death they wish. I mean theirrivalry to each other. Restaud is of ancient family his wife has beenadopted by his relatives and presented at court. But the rich sisterthe beautiful Madame Delphine de Nucingen is dying with envy thevictim of jealousy. She is a hundred leagues lower in society than hersister. They renounce each other as they both renounced their father.Madame de Nucingen would lap up all the mud between the Rue Saint-Lazareand the Rue de Crenelle to gain admission to my salon." What theduchesse did not reveal was that Anastasie had a lover Count Maxime deTrailles a gambler and a duellist. To pay the gambling losses of thisunscrupulous lover to the extent of two hundred thousand francs theCountess de Restaud induced Old Goriot to sell out of the funds nearlyall that remained of his great fortune and give the proceeds to her.Returning to his lodgings from a ball in the Faubourg Saint-GermainEugne saw a light in Goriot's room and without being noticed watchedthe old man laboriously twisting two pieces of silver plate--hisprecious dish and porringer--into one lump."He must be mad" thought the student."The poor child" groaned Goriot.The next morning Goriot visited a silversmith and the Countess de
comment121,Restaud received the money to redeem a note of hand which she had givento a moneylender on behalf of her lover."Old Goriot is sublime" muttered Eugne when he heard of thetransaction.Delphine de Nucingen also had an admirer Count de Marsay through whoseinfluence she expected to be introduced into the exclusive aristocraticsociety to which even the great wealth of her husband and his Germanpatent of nobility could not secure an entry. Apart from her socialaspirations Delphine was personally extravagant and as the baron wasmiserly and only gave her a very scanty allowance she visited thegambling dens of the Palais Royale to try and raise the money which shecould no longer coax from her old father._III.--A Temptation and a Murder_To be young to thirst after a position in the world of fashion tohunger for the smiles of beautiful women to obtain an entry into thesalons of the Faubourg meant to Rastignac large expenditure. He wrotehome asking for a loan of twelve hundred francs which he said he musthave at all costs. The Viscomtesse de Beausant had taken him under herprotection and he was in a situation to make an immediate fortune. Hemust go into society but had not a penny even to buy gloves. The loanwould be returned tenfold.The mother sold her jewels the aunt her old laces his sisterssacrificed their economies and the twelve hundred francs were sent toEugne. With this sum he launched into the gay life of a man of fashiondressed extravagantly and gambled recklessly. One day Vautrin arrivedin high spirits surprising Eugne conversing with Victorine. This wasVautrin's opportunity for which he had been preparing. When Victorineretired Vautrin pointed out how impossible it was to maintain aposition in society as a law student and if Eugne wished to get onquickly he must either be rich or make believe to be so."In view of all the circumstances therefore I make a proposition toyou" said Vautrin to Eugne "which I think no man in your positionshould refuse. I wish to become a great planter in the Southern Statesof America and need two hundred thousand francs. If I get you a dot ofa million will you give me two hundred thousand francs Is twenty percent commission on such a transaction too much You will secure theaffection of a little wife. A few weeks after marriage you will seemdistracted. Some night between kisses you can own a debt of twohundred thousand francs and ask your darling to pay it. The farce isacted every day by young men of good family and no amorous young wifewill refuse the money to the man she adores. Moreover you will not losethe money you will easily get it back by judicious speculation""But where can I find such a girl" said Eugne."She is here close at hand.""Mademoiselle Victorine""Precisely""But how can that be""She loves you already she thinks herself the little Baroness deRastignac.""She has not a penny" cried Eugne in amazement."Ah now we are coming to the point" said Vautrin.
comment122,Thereupon Vautrin insinuated that if papa Taillefer lost his sonthrough the interposition of a wise Providence he would take back hispretty and amiable daughter who would inherit his millions. To this endhe Vautrin frankly volunteered to play the part of destiny. He had afriend a colonel in the army of the Loire who would pick a quarrelwith Frederic the young blackguard son who had never sent a five-francpiece to his poor sister and then "to the shades"--making a pass as ifwith a sword."Silence monsieur I will hear no more.""As you please my beautiful boy I thought you were stronger."A few days after this scene Mademoiselle Michonneau and Poiret weresitting on a bench in the Jardin des Plantes when they were accosted bythe chief of the detective force. He told them that the minister ofpolice believed that a man calling himself Vautrin who lived with themin the Maison Vauquer was an escaped convict from Toulon galleysJacques Collin but known by the nickname of Trompe-la-Mort and one ofthe most dangerous criminals in all France. In order to obtain certaintyas to the identity of Vautrin with Collin he offered a bribe of threethousand francs if mademoiselle would administer a potion in his coffeeor wine which would affect him as if he were stricken with apoplexy.During his insensibility they could easily discover whether Vautrin hadthe convict's brand on his shoulder. The pair accepted the bribe andthe plot succeeded. Vautrin was identified as Collin and arrested justas a messenger came to announce that Frederic Taillefer had been killedin a duel and Victorine was carried off with Madame Couture to herfather's home the sole heir to his millions. When he was being pinionedto be conveyed back to the galleys Collin looked upon his late fellowboarders with fierce scorn. "Are you any better than we convicts are"said he. "We have less infamy branded on our shoulders than you have inyour hearts--you flabby members of a gangrened society. There is somevirtue here" exclaimed he striking his breast. "I have never betrayedanyone. As for you you old female Judas" turning to MademoiselleMichonneau "look at these people. They regard me with terror but theirhearts turn with disgust even to glance at you. Pick up your ill-gottengains and begone." As Jacques Collin disappeared from the MaisonVauquer and from our story Sylvie the fat cook exclaimed "Well hewas a man all the same"Although the way was now clear for Rastignac to marry the enormouslywealthy Victorine he paid court instead to Delphine the Baroness deNucingen and dined with her every night. Old Goriot was informed of theintrigue by the baroness's maid. He did not resent but rather encouragedthe liaison and spent his last ten thousand francs in furnishing asuite of apartments for the young couple on condition that he was to beallowed to occupy an adjoining room and see his daughter every day._IV.--Old Goriot's Death-Bed_The Viscomtesse de Beausant was broken-hearted when the marriage of herlover was accomplished but to maintain a brave spirit in the face ofsociety she gave a farewell ball before retiring to her country estate.Among those invited was the Countess de Restaud who ordered a richcostume for the occasion which however she was unable to pay for. Herhusband the count insisted on her appearing at the ball and wearingthe family diamonds which she had pawned to discharge her lover's
comment123,gambling debts and which had been redeemed to save the family honour.Anastasie sent her maid to Old Goriot who rose from a sick-bed soldhis last forks and spoons for six hundred francs pledged his annuityfor four hundred francs and so raised a thousand which enabledAnastasie to obtain the gown and shine at the ball. Through Rastignac'sinfluence Delphine Baroness de Nucingen received from the viscomtessea ticket for the dance and insisted on going as Rastignac declared"even over the dead body of her father" to challenge her sister'ssocial precedence at the supreme society function. The ball was the mostbrilliant of the Parisian season. Both Goriot's daughters satisfiedtheir selfish ambitions and gave never a thought to their old parent inthe wretched Maison Vauquer.For Old Goriot was sick unto death. His garret was bare the wallsdripped with moisture the floor was damp the bed was comfortless andthe few faggots which made the handful of fire had been bought only bythe money got from pawning Eugne's watch. Christophe the man servantwas sent by Rastignac to tell the daughters of their father's condition."Tell them that I am not very well" said Old Goriot "that I shouldlike to see them to kiss them before I die."By and by when the messenger had gone the old man said "I don't wantto die. To die my good Eugne is--not to see them there where I amgoing. How lonely I shall be Hell to a father is to be without hischildren. Tell me if I go to heaven can I come back in spirit andhover near them You saw them at the ball they did not know that I wasill did they"On the return of the messenger Old Goriot was told that both hisdaughters refused to come and see him. Delphine was too tired andsleepy Anastasie was discussing with her husband the future dispositionof her marriage portion. Then alternately Goriot blamed his daughtersand pardoned their unfilial and selfish behaviour."My daughters were my vice--my mistresses. Oh they will come Come mydarlings A kiss a last kiss the viaticum of your father I am justlypunished my children were good and I have spoiled them on my head betheir sins. I alone am guilty but guilty through love." Eugne tried tosoothe the old man by saying that he would go himself to fetch hisdaughters but Goriot kept muttering in his semi-delirium. "Here Nasie
comment124,here Delphine come to your father who has been so good to you and whois dying Are they coming No Am I to die like a dog This is myreward forsaken abandoned They are wicked they are criminal. I hatethem. I will rise from my coffin to curse them. Oh this is horribleAh it is my sons-in-law who keep them away from me""My good Old Goriot" said Eugne "be calm.""Not to see them--it is the agony of death""You shall see them.""Ah my angels"And with these feeble words Old Goriot sank back on the pillow andbreathed his last.Anastasie did come to the death-chamber but too late. "I could notescape soon enough" she said to Rastignac. The student smiled sadlyand Madame de Restaud took her father's hand and kissed it saying"Forgive me my father."Goriot had a pauper's funeral. The aristocratic sons-in-law refused topay the expenses of the burial. These were scraped together withdifficulty by Eugne de Rastignac the law student and Bianchon themedical student who had nursed him with loving tenderness to the last.At the graveside in Pre Lachaise Eugne and Christophe were the onlymourners Bianchon's duties detained him at the hospital. When the bodyof Old Goriot was lowered into the earth the clergy recited a shortprayer--all that could be given for the student's money. The pall ofnight was falling the mist struck a chill on Eugne's nerves and whenhe took a last glance at the shell containing all that was mortal of hisold friend he buried the last tear of his young manhood--a tear drawnby a sacred emotion from a pure heart.Eugne wandered to the most elevated part of the cemetery whence hesurveyed that portion of the city between the Place Vendome and the domeof the Invalides where lives that world of fashion which he hadhungered to penetrate. With bitterness he muttered "Now there isrelentless war between us." And as the first act of defiance which hehad sworn against society Rastignac went to dine with Madame Nucingen                                   The Magic Skin     In no other work is the special quality of Balzac's genius     displayed so completely as in "La Peau de Chagrin" which we     render as "The Magic Skin." Published in 1831 it is the     earliest in date of his veritable masterpieces and the finest     in conception. There is no novel more soberly true to life     than this strange fairy tale. His hero the Marquis de     Valentin is a young aristocrat of the Byronic type. He     rejects the simple joys and stern realities of human     existence he wants more than life can give. He gets what he     wants. He obtains a magic skin which enables him to fulfil his     every wish. But in so doing he uses up his vital powers. Such     is the idea which makes this fantastic story a profound     philosophical study._I.--The Seal of Solomon_On a dull morning towards the end of October 1830 a tall pale andrather handsome young man came to the Pont Royal and leaned over thebridge and gazed with wild and yet resolute eyes at the swirling watersbelow. Just as he was preparing to leap down a ragged old woman passed
comment125,by."Wretched weather for drowning oneself isn't it" she said with agrin. "How cold and dirty the Seine looks"The young man turned and smiled at her in the delirium of his courage.Then suddenly he shuddered. On a shed by the Tuileries he saw writtenin large letters "Help for the drowned." He foresaw the whole thing. Aboat would put off to the rescue. If the rowers did not smash his skullin with their oars as he came to the surface he would be taken to theshed and revived. If he were dead a crowd would collect newspaper menwould come his body would be recognised and the Press would publishthe news of the suicide of Raphael de Valentin. No He would wait tillnightfall and then in a decent private manner bequeath anunrecognizable corpse to a world that had disregarded his genius.With the air of a wealthy man of leisure sauntering about the streets tokill time the young marquis strolled down the Quai Voltaire andfollowed the line of shops looking listlessly at every window. But ashe thought of the fate awaiting him at nightfall men and houses swam ina mist before his eyes. To recover himself he entered a curiosity shop."If you care to go through our galleries" said the red-haired shop-boy"you will find something worth looking at."Raphael climbed up a dark staircase lined with mummies Indian idolsstuffed crocodiles and goggle-eyed monsters. They all seemed to grin athim as he passed. Haunted by these strange shapes belonging to theborderland between life and death he walked in a kind of dream througha series of long dimly lighted galleries in which was piled in madconfusion the work of every age and every clime. Here was a lovelystatue by Michael Angelo from which dangled the scalp of a Red Indian.There cold and impassive was the lord of the ancient world theEmperor Augustus with a modern air-pump sticking in his eye. The wallswere hung with priceless pictures which were half-hidden by grimacingskeletons rude wooden idols with horrible features tall suits ofgleaming armour and figures of Egyptian deities with the bodies of menand heads of animals. The place was a kitchen of all the arts andreligions and interests of mankind.This extraordinary confusion was rendered still more bizarre by the dimcross-lights that played upon everything. Raphael's eyes grew weary withgazing and his mind was oppressed by the spectacle of the ruinedsplendours of thousands of years of human life. A fever born of hungerand exhaustion possessed him. The pictures appeared to light up thestatues seemed to move. Everything danced and swayed around him. Then ahorrible Chinese monster advanced upon him with menacing eyes from theother side of the room and he swooned away in terror.When he came to his eyes were dazzled by a flood or radiance streamingfrom a circle of crimson light. Before him holding a bright red lampwas a frail white-haired extraordinary man clad in a long robe ofblack velvet. His body was wasted by extreme old age. His skin was likewrinkled parchment and his lips were so thin and colourless that it washardly possible to discern on his ivory-white face the line made by hismouth. But his eyes were marvellous. They were calm clear andsearching and they glowed with the light and freshness of youth."So you have been looking over my collection" the old man said. "Do youwish to buy anything""Buy" said Raphael with a strange smile. "I am utterly penniless. Ihave been examining your treasures just to while away the time till Icould drown myself quietly and secretly at night. You will not grudgethis last pleasure to a poet and man of learning will you"
comment126,"Penniless" said the old man. "But you do not want to die because youare penniless A young handsome intellectual lad like you could pickup a living somehow. What is it Some woman eh Now let me help----""I want no help or advice or consolation" said Raphael furiously."And I will give you none" said the old man. "But as you are resolvedto die will you do something for me. I want to get rid of this."He held the lamp up the wall and showed Raphael a piece of very oldshagreen about the size of a fox's skin."Ah" said Raphael. "A wild ass's skin engraved with Sanscritcharacters. Why here's the mark that some of the Eastern races call theSeal of Solomon""You are truly a man of learning" said the strange old merchant hisbreath coming in quick pants through his nostrils. "No doubt you canread the inscription.""I should translate it thus" said Raphael fixing his eyes upon theskin.    POSSESSING ME THOU POSSESSEST EVERYTHING. YET I    POSSESS THEE. SO GOD HAS WILLED IT. WISH AND    THY WISHES SHALL BE ACCOMPLISHED. BUT MEASURE    THE WISHES ACCORDING TO THY LIFE. HERE    IT IS. I SHALL SHRINK WITH EACH WISH AND    SO SHALL THY LIFE WILT THOU TAKE ME    TAKE ME GOD WILL HEAR THEE. AMEN."Is it a joke or a mystery""I do not know" said the old man. "I have offered the magic skin tomany men. They laughed at it but none would take it. I am like them. Idoubt its power but will not put it to the test.""What" said Raphael. "You have never formed a wish all the time you hadit""No" said the old man. "I have discovered the great secret of humanlife. Look I am a hundred and two years old. Do you know why men dieBecause they use up the energy of life by wishing to do things and doingthem. I am content to know things. My days have been spent wanderingquietly over all the earth in the calm acquisition of knowledge. Alldesire all lust after power are dead within me. So this skin which Ipicked up in India has never shrunk an inch since it came into mypossession.""You have never lived" cried Raphael turning from the old man andseizing the skin. "Yes I will take you. Now for a test. I am starving.Set before me a splendid banquet. Let me have as guests all the wildestgayest wittiest minds of young France. And women Oh the prettiestwickedest women of the town Wine wit and women"A roar of laughter came from the old man. It resounded in the ears ofRaphael like the laughter of a fiend from hell."Do you think my floors are going to open and tables waiters andguests pop up before your eyes" he said. "No Your first wish is meanand vulgar but it will be fulfilled in a natural manner. You wanted to
comment127,die eh Your suicide is only postponed."Raphael put the skin in his pocket and abruptly left saying "You havenever lived. I wish you knew what love was."He heard the old man groan strangely but without listening to hisreproaches he rushed out of the shop and in the street ran full tilt upagainst three young men."Brute Ass Idiot Why it's Raphael" they cried. "You must come. Talkabout a Roman orgy I We've been all over Paris looking for you. Agorgeous feed. And all the girls from the Opera The ancient Romansaren't in it.""One at a time" said Raphael. "Now Emile just tell me what are youall shouting about""Do you know Taillefer the wealthy banker" said Emile. "He is foundinga newspaper. All the talent of young France is to be enlisted. You'reinvited to the inaugural festival to-night at the Rue Joubert. Theballot girls of the Opera are coming. Oh Taillefer's doing the thing instyle"Arm linked in arm the four friends made their way to Taillefer'smansion and there in a large room brilliantly set out they werewelcomed by all the younger men of note in Paris. For some time Raphaelfelt ill at ease. He was surprised by the natural manner in which hiswish had suddenly been accomplished. He took the magic skin out of hispocket and looked at it. Magic What man could believe nowadays inmagic But nevertheless he marvelled at the accidents of human life._II--A Fight Against Fate_Although the banquet which he had desired was now set before himRaphael was still very moody. Deaf to the loud wild merriment of hiscompanions he thought sadly of the misfortune which had driven him thatmorning to the brink of the grave. Many noblemen find it difficult toexist in Paris on an income of several thousand pounds. The youngMarquis de Valentin had lived there very happily on 12 a year. In 1826his father who had lost his wealth and lands in the Revolution haddied leaving him 40. Taking a garret in the Rue des Cordiers he hadset about earning his living with his pen and for three years he hadlaboured at a great work on "The Theory of the Will." He never went intosociety but found a pleasant distraction from his studies in educatingthe daughter of his landlady.Pauline Gaudin was a charming and beautiful child her father a baronof the empire and an officer in the Grand Army had been taken prisonerby the Russians in 1812 and never heard of since. Raphael was moved bythe grace and innocence of the lovely human flower that grew from a budinto an opening blossom under his care. But as he was too poor to marryher he never made love to her.Then in January 1830 he met the Countess Foedora a brilliantwealthy woman of society widowed at the age of thirty and eager to
comment128,shine and astonish and captivate. For her sake Raphael had put asidehis scholarly studies and engaged in money-making hack-work. But afterkeeping him dangling about her for some months she had cast him offand in his misery he had resolved to end his life. Now he had got themagic skin. What if it were true what the strange old man had saidShould he wish to win the heart of Foedora No She was a woman withouta heart. He would have nothing to do with women. Still this skin"Measure it Measure it" he cried flinging it down on the table."Measure what" said Emile. "Has Taillefer's wine got into your headalready"Raphael told them of the curiosity shop."That can be easily tested" said Emile taking the skin and drawing itsoutline on a napkin. "Now wish and see if it shrinks.""I wish for six million pounds" said Raphael."Hurrah" said Emile. "And while you're about it make us allmillionaires."Taillefer's notary Cardot who had been gazing at Raphael during thedinner walked across the room to him."My dear marquis" he said "I've been looking for you all the evening.Wasn't your mother a Miss O'Flaharty""Yes she was" said Raphael--"Barbara O'Flaharty.""Well you are the sole heir of Major O'Flaharty who died last Augustat Calcutta leaving a fortune of six millions.""An incalculable fortune" said Emile. Raphael spread out the skin uponthe napkin. He shuddered violently on seeing a slight margin between thepencil-line on the napkin and the edge of the skin."What's the matter" said the notary. "He has got a fortune verycheaply.""Hold him up" said some one. "The joy will kill him."A ghostly whiteness spread over the face of the happy heir. He had seenDeath He stared at the shrunken skin and the merciless outline on thenapkin and a feeling of horror came over him. The whole world was hishe could have all things. But at what a cost"Do you wish for some asparagus sir" said a waiter."_I wish for nothing_" shrieked Raphael. And he fled from the banquet."So" he said when he was at last alone "in this enlightened age whenscience has stripped the very stars of their secrets here am Ifrightened out of my senses by an old piece of wild ass's skin.To-morrow I will have it examined by Planchette and put an end to thismad fancy."Planchette the celebrated professor of mechanics treated the thing asa joke."Come with me to Spieghalter" he said. "He has just built a new kind ofhydraulic press which I designed."Arrived there Planchette asked Spieghalter to stretch the magic skin."Our friend" he said "doubts if we can do it.""You see this crank" said Spieghalter to Raphael pointing to the newpress. "Seven turns to it and a solid steel bar would break intothousands of pieces.""The very thing I want" said Raphael.Planchette put the skin between the metal plates and proud of his newinvention he energetically twisted the crank."Lie flat all of you" shouted Spieghalter. "We're dead men."There was an explosion and a jet of water spurted out with terrificforce. Falling on a furnace it twisted up the mass of iron as if it hadbeen paper. The hydraulic chamber of the press had given way.
comment129,"The skin is untouched" said Planchette. "There was a flaw in thepress.""No no" said Spieghalter. "My press was as sound as a bell. Thedevil's in your skin sir. Take it away"Spieghalter seized the talisman and flung it on an anvil and furiouslybelaboured it with a heavy sledgehammer. He then pitched it in afurnace and ordered his workmen to blow the coal into a fierce whiteheat. At the end of ten minutes he drew it out with a pair of tongsuninjured. With a cry of horror the workmen fled from the foundry."I now believe in the devil" said Spieghalter."And I believe in God" said Planchette.Raphael departed in a hard bitter rage. He was resolved to fight like aman against his strange fate. He would follow the example of the formerowner of the magic skin and give himself up to study and meditationand live his life in the tranquil acquisition of knowledge undisturbedby passion and desire and lust for power and dominion and glory. Onreceiving his vast inheritance he bought a mansion in the Rue deVarenne and engaged a crowd of intelligent quiet servants to wait uponhim.But his first care had been to seek out his foster-father Jonathan theold and devoted servitor of his family. To him he confided his dreadfulsecret."You must stand between the world and me Jonathan" he said. "Treat meas a baby. Never ask me for orders. See that the servants feed me andtend me and care for me in absolute silence. Above all things neverlet anyone pester me. Never let me form a wish of any kind."For some months the eccentric Marquis de Valentin was the talk ofParis. He lived in monastic silence and seclusion and Jonathan neverpermitted any of his friends to enter the mansion. But one morning hisold tutor Porriquet called and Jonathan thought he might cheer hisyoung master. He could not ask Raphael "Do you wish to see M.Porriquet" But after some thought he found a way of putting thequestion "M. Porriquet is here my lord. Do you think he ought toenter"Raphael nodded. Porriquet was alarmed at the appearance of his pupil. Helooked like a plant bleached by darkness. The fact was Raphael hadsurrendered every right in life in order to live. He had despoiled hissoul of all the romance that lies in a wish. The better to struggle withthe cruel power that he had challenged he had stifled his imagination.He did not allow himself even the pleasures of fancy lest they shouldawaken some desire. He had become an automaton.Porriquet unfortunately was now an irritating old proser. He hadfailed in life and wanted to air all his grievances. At the end of fiveminutes' talk Raphael was about to wish that he would depart when hecaught sight of the magic skin hanging in a frame with a red line drawnaround it. Suppressing with a shudder his secret desire he patientlybore with the old man's prolixity. Porriquet wanted very much to ask him
comment130,for money but did not like to do so and after complaining for quite anhour or more about things in general he rose to depart."Perhaps" he said as he turned to leave the room "I shall hear of aheadmastership of a good school.""The very thing for you" said Raphael. "I _wish_ you could get it."Then with a sudden cry he looked at the frame. There was a thin whiteedge between the skin and the red line."Go you fool" he shouted. "I have made you a headmaster. Why didn'tyou ask me for an annuity of a thousand pounds instead of using up tenyears of my life on a silly wish I could have won Foedora at the priceConquered a kingdom"His lips were covered with froth and there was a savage light in hiseyes. Porriquet fled in terror. Then Raphael fell back in a chair andwept."Oh my precious life" he sobbed. "No more kindly thoughts No morefriendship"_III.--The Agony of Death_Raphael's condition had by now become so critical that a trip to Savoywas advised and a few weeks later he was at Aix. One day moving amongthe crowd of pleasure-seekers and invalids a number of young mendeliberately picked a quarrel with him with the result that from one ofthem he received a challenge to fight a duel. Raphael did his utmost topersuade the other to apologise even going to the extent of informinghim of the terrible powers he possessed. Failing in his object thefatal morning came round and the unfortunate individual was shotthrough the heart. Not heeding the fallen man Raphael hurriedly glancedat the skin to see what another man's life had cost him. The talismanhad shrunk to the size of a small oak-leaf.Seeing that his master was given over to a gloomy despair that vergedupon madness Jonathan resolved to distract his mind at all costs andknowing that he was passionately fond of music he engaged a box for himat the Opera. But Raphael was afraid above all things of falling inlove. Under the illimitable desire of passion the magic skin wouldshrivel up in an hour. So he used a strange distorting opera-glasswhich made the loveliest face seem hideous.With this he sat in his box he surveyed the scene around him. Who wasthat old man over there sitting beside a dancing-girl that Raphael hadseen at Taillefer's The owner of the curiosity shop He had at lastfallen in love as Raphael had jestingly desired. No doubt the magicskin had shrunk under that wish before Raphael had measured it. Abeautiful woman entered the theatre with a peer of France at her side. Amurmur of admiration arose as she took her seat. She smiled at Raphael.In spite of the distorted image on his opera-glass Raphael knew her. Itwas the Countess Foedora In a single glance of intolerable scorn theman she had played false avenged himself. He did not waste an ill-wishon her. He merely took the glasses from his eyes and answered her smilewith a look of cold contempt. Everybody observed the sudden pallor ofthe countess it was a public rejection."Raphael"The marquis turned at the sound of a beloved voice. Pauline was sittingin the box next to his. How beautiful she had grown How maidenly shewas still Putting down his opera-glasses Raphael talked to her of oldtimes."You must come and see me to-morrow" said Pauline. "I have your greatwork on 'The Theory of the Will.' Don't you remember leaving it in thegarret""I was mad and blind then" said Raphael. "But I am cured at last.""I wish Pauline to love me" he kept repeating to himself all the wayhome. "I wish Pauline to love me"With a strange mixture of wild anguish and fierce joy he looked at themagic skin to see what this vehement wish had cost him. Nothing Not asign of shrinkage could be discerned. The fact was that even thegreatest talisman could not realise a desire which had long since beenfulfilled. Pauline had loved Raphael from the time when they first metwhile he had been priding himself on living on twelve pounds a year shehad been painting screens up to two or three o'clock every night inorder to buy him food and firing."Oh my simple-minded darling" she said to him the next day sitting onhis lap and twining her arms about his neck "you will never know what a
comment131,pleasure it was for me to pay my handsome tutor for all his kindness.And wasn't I cunning You never found me out.""But I've found out now" said Raphael "and I am going to punish youseverely. Instead of marrying you in three months' time as you suggestI shall marry you at the end of this week."Raphael was now the happiest man in Paris. Seeing that the magic skinhad not shrunk with his last wish he thought that the spell over hislife was removed. And that morning he had thrown the talisman down adisused well in the garden.At the end of the week Pauline was sitting at breakfast with Raphael inthe conservatory overlooking the garden. She was wearing a lightdressing-gown her long hair was all dishevelled and her little whiteblue-veined feet peeped out of their velvet slippers. She gave a littlecry of dismay when the gardener appeared."I've just found this strange thing at the bottom of one of the wells"he said.He gave Raphael the magic skin. It was now scarcely as large as a roseleaf."Leave me Pauline Leave me at once" cried Raphael. "If you remain Ishall die before your eyes.""Die" she said. "Die You cannot. I love you--I love you""Yes die" he exclaimed showing her the little bit of skin. "Lookdearest. This is a talisman which represents the length of my life andaccomplishes my wishes. You see how little is left."Pauline thought he had suddenly grown mad. She bent over him and tookup the magic skin. As Raphael saw her beautiful with love and terrorhe lost all control over his desires. To possess her again and die onher breast"Come to me Pauline" he said.She felt the skin tickling her hand as it rapidly shrivelled up. Sherushed into the bedroom and closed the door."Pauline Pauline" cried the dying man stumbling after her. "I loveyou I want you I wish to die for you"With extraordinary strength--the last outburst of life--he tore the dooroff the hinges and saw Pauline in agony on a sofa. She had stabbedherself."If I die he will live" she was crying.Raphael staggered across the room and fell into the arms of beautifulPauline dead.                                   The Quest of the Absolute     "La Recherche de l'Absolu" was published in 1834 with a     touching dedication to Madame Josephine Delannoy "Madame may     it please God that this my book may live when I am dead     that the gratitude which is due from me to you and which     equals I trust your motherlike generosity to me may hope to     endure beyond the limits set to human love." The novel became     a part of the "Human Comedy" in 1845. The struggle of     Balthazar Claes in his quest for the Absolute his disregard     of all else save his work and the heroic devotion of     Josephine and Marguerite are characteristic features of     Balzac's art the sordidness of life and the mad passion for     the unattainable are admirably relieved as in "Eugnie     Grandet" and "Old Goriot" by a certain nobility and purity of     motive. The novel is generally acknowledged one of Balzac's     masterpieces both in vigour of portraiture and minuteness of     detail. Perhaps no one was ever better fitted to depict the     ruin wrought by a fixed idea than Balzac himself who wasted     much of his laborious life in struggling to discover a short     cut to wealth._I.--Claes the Alchemist_In Douai situated in the Rue de Paris there is a house which standsout from all the rest in the city by reason of its purely Flemishcharacter. In all its details this tall and handsome house expressesthe manners of the domesticated people of the Low Countries. The name ofthe house for some two centuries has been Maison Claes after the greatfamily of craftsmen who occupied it. These Van Claes had amassedfortunes played a part in politics and had suffered many vicissitudesin the course of history without losing their place in the mightybourgeois world of commerce. They were substantial people princes oftrade.At the end of the eighteenth century the representative of this ancientand affluent family was Balthazar Claes a tall and handsome young man
comment132,who after some years' residence in Paris where he saw the fashionableworld and made acquaintance with many of the great savants includingLavoisier the chemist returned to his home in Douai and set himself tofind a wife.It was on a visit to a relation in Ghent that he heard gossip concerninga young lady living in Brussels which made him curious to see sointeresting a person. Rumour had two tales to tell of this Mlle.Josephine Temninck. She was beautiful but she was deformed. Coulddeformity be triumphed over by beauty of face A relative of Claesthought that it could and maintained this opinion against the oppositecamp. This relative spoke of Mlle. Temninck's character telling how thesweet girl had surrendered her share of the family estate that heryounger brother might make a great marriage and how she had quiteresigned herself even on the threshold of her life to the idea ofspinsterhood and narrow means.Claes sought out this noble soul. He found her inexpressibly beautifuland the malformation of one of her shoulders appeared as nothing in hiseyes. He lost his heart to Josephine and made passionate love to her.Distracted by such adoration the beautiful cripple was now lifted todizzy heights of joy and now plunged into abysmal depths of despair. Shehad deemed herself irreparably plain in the eyes of a charming youngman she found herself beautiful. But could such love endure throughlife To be loved was delicious but to be deceived after so surprisinga release from solitude would be terrible.Conscious of her deformity intimidated by the future she became in thepurity of her soul a coquette. She dissimulated her feelings becameexacting and hid from her lover the passion of joy which was consumingher indeed she only revealed her true self after marriage had shownher the steadfast nobility of her husband's character when she could nolonger doubt of his affection. He loved her with fidelity and ardour.She realised all his ideals and no consideration of duty entered intotheir passionate affection. She was Spanish and had the secret of charmin her variety of attraction ill-educated though she was like mostdaughters of Spanish noblemen she was engaging and bewildering in theforce of her own nature and the religion of her absorbing love. Insociety she was dull for her husband alone she was enchanting. Nocouple could have been happier.They had four children two boys and two girls the eldest a girl namedMarguerite.Fourteen years after their marriage in the year 1809 a change appearedin Balthazar but so gradually that Mme. Claes did not at first questionit. He became thoughtful reflective silent preoccupied. WhenJosephine Claes noticed this change it was too late for her to askquestions she waited for Balthazar to speak. She began to fear.Balthazar whose whole heaven had lain in the happiness of the familylife who had loved to play with his children to attend to his tulipsto sun himself in the dark eyes of Josephine seemed now to forget theexistence of them all. He was indifferent to everything.People who questioned her were put off with the brave story thatBalthazar had a great work in hand which would bring fame one day tohis native town. Josephine's hazard was founded on truth. Workmen hadbeen engaged for some time in the garret of the house and there Claesspent the greater part of his time. But the poor lady was to learn thefull truth from the neighbours she had attempted to hoodwink. They askedher if she meant to see herself and her children ruined adding that herhusband was spending a fortune on scientific instruments machinerybooks and materials in a search for the Philosopher's Stone.Humiliated that the neighbours should know more than she did andterrified by the prospect in front of her Josephine at last spoke toher husband."My dear" he said "you would not understand what I am about. I amstudying chemistry and I am perfectly happy."
comment133,Things went from bad to worse. Claes became more taciturn and moreinvisible to his family. He was slovenly in dress and untidy in hishabits. Only his servant Lemulquinier or Mulquinier as he was oftencalled was allowed to enter the attic and share his master's secrets.Mme. Claes had a rival. It was science.One day she went to the garret but Claes repulsed her with wrath androughness."My experiment is absolutely spoilt" he cried vehemently. "In anotherminute I might have resolved nitrogen."_II.--The Riddle of Existence_Josephine consulted Claes's notary M. Pierquin a young man and arelative of the family. He looked into matters and found that Claesowed a hundred thousand francs to a firm of chemists in Paris. He warnedJosephine that ruin was certain if this state of things continued.Hitherto she had loved husband more than children now the mother wasroused in her and for her children's sakes she determined to act. Shehad sold her diamonds to provide for the housekeeping since for sixmonths Claes had given her nothing she had sent away the governess shehad economised in a hundred directions. Now she must act against herhusband. But her children came between her and her true life since hertrue life was Balthazar's. She loved him with a sublime passion whichcould sacrifice everything except her children.One Sunday after vespers in 1812 she sent for her husband andawaited him at a window of one of the lower rooms which looked on thegarden. Tears were in her eyes. As she sat there suddenly over her headsounded the footsteps of Claes making her start. No one could haveheard that slow and dragging step unmoved. One wondered if it were aliving thing.He entered the apartment thin round-shouldered with disordered longhair his cravat awry his clothes stained and torn."Are you so absorbed in your work Balthazar" said Josephine. "It isthirty-three Sundays since you have been either to vespers or mass.""Vespers" he questioned vaguely. Then added "Ah the children havebeen to church" and walked to the window and looked at the tulips. Ashe stood there he said to himself "But yes why shouldn't they combinein a given time"His poor wife asked herself in despair "Is he going mad" Then rousingherself she called him by his name. Without paying heed to her hecoughed and went to one of the spittoons beside the wainscot."Monsieur I speak to you""What of that" he demanded turning swiftly. She became deadly white."Forgive me dear" she whispered and cried "Ah this is killing me"Tears in her eyes roused Claes out of his reverie. He took her into hisarms pushed open a door and sprang lightly up the staircase. Findingthe door of her apartment locked he laid her gently in an armchair."Thank you dear" she murmured. "I have not been so near your heart fora long time."Her loveliness postponed disaster. Enamoured by her beauty rescued tohumanity Claes returned for a brief interval to the family life andwas adorable to his wife charming to his children. When they were alonetogether Josephine questioned him as to his secret work telling himthat she had begun to study chemistry in order that she might share hislife. Touched by this devotion Claes declared his secret. A Polish
comment134,officer had come to their house in 1809 and had discussed chemistrywith Claes. The result of the conversations had set Claes to search forthe single element out of which all things are perhaps composed. ThePolish officer had confided certain secrets to him saying "You are adisciple of Lavoisier you are wealthy you are free I will give you myidea. The Primitive Element must be common to oxygen hydrogennitrogen and carbon. Force must be the common principle of positive andnegative electricity. Demonstrate these two hypotheses and you willhold in your hands the First Cause the solution of the great riddle ofexistence."As Claes rattled away Josephine suddenly exclaimed against her will"So it was this man who spent but one night with us that stole yourlove from me and your children Did he make the Sign of the Cross Didyou observe him closely He was Satan Only the devil could have stolenyou from me. Ever since his visit you have ceased to be father andhusband.""Do you rebuke me" Balthazar asked "for being superior to common men"And he poured out a tale of his achievements. In the height of hispassion for her Josephine had never seen his face so shining withenthusiasm as it was now. Tears came into her eyes."I have combined chlorine and nitrogen" he rhapsodised "I haveanalysed endless substances. I have analysed tears Tears are nothingmore than phosphate of lime chloride of sodium mucus and water."He ran on till she cried upon him to stop."You horrify me" she said "with your blasphemies. What my love is----""Spiritualised matter given off" replied Claes "the secret no doubtof the Absolute. If I am the first to find it out Think of it I willmake metals and diamonds. What Nature does I will do.""You trespass on God" Josephine exclaimed impatiently. "You deny GodAh God has a force which you will never exercise""What is that" he demanded."Motion. Analysis is one thing creation is another" she said. Herpleadings were successful. Balthazar abandoned his researches and thefamily removed to the country. He was awakened by his wife's love to theknowledge that he had brought his fortune to the verge of ruin. Hepromised to abandon his experiments. As some amends he threw himselfinto preparations for a great ball at the Maison Claes in honour of hiswedding day. The festivity was saddened by the news of disaster to theGrand Army at Beresina. One of the letters that arrived that day wasfrom the Polish officer dying of his wounds who sent Claes as alegacy some of his ideas for discovering the Absolute. No one dancedthe fte was gloomy only Marguerite shone like a lovely flower on theanxious company. When the guests departed Balthazar showed Josephinethe letter from the Pole. She did everything a woman could do todistract his thoughts. She made the home life enchanting. Sheentertained. She introduced the movement of the world into the greathouse. In vain. Her husband's _ennui_ was terrible to behold. "I releaseyou from your promise" she said to him one day.Balthazar returned with Lemulquinier to the attic and the experimentsbegan anew. He was quite happy again.A year passed the Absolute was undiscovered. Once more ruin haunted thestate room of the Maison Claes. Josephine's confessor the Abb deSolis who had sold her jewels now suggested selling some of theFlemish pictures. Josephine explained the situation to her husband."What do you think" he cried. "I am within an ace of finding theAbsolute. I have only to discover--"Josephine broke down. She left her husband and retired downstairs toher children. The servants were summoned. Madame Claes looked likedeath. Everybody was alarmed. Lemulquinier was told to go for thepriest. He said he had monsieur's orders to see to in the laboratory.
comment135,_III.--The Passing of Josephine_It was the beginning of the end for Josephine. As she lay dying she sawjudgment in the eyes of Marguerite--judgment on Balthazar. Her last dayswere sorrowed by the thought that the children would condemn theirfather. Balthazar came sometimes to sit with her but he appeared to beunaware of her situation. He was charming to the younger children buthe was dead to the true condition of his wife.One thing gave her peace. The Abb de Solis brought his nephew to thehouse and this young man Emmanuel who was good and noble evidentlycreated a favourable impression on Marguerite. The dying mother watchedthe progress of this love story with affectionate satisfaction. It wasall she had to light her way to the grave. Pierquin told her thatBalthazar had ordered him to raise three hundred thousand francs on hisestate. She saw that ruin could not be averted she lay at death's doordeserted by the husband she still worshipped thinking of the childrenshe had sacrificed. The noble character of Marguerite cheered her lasthours. In that child she would live on and be a providence to thefamily.One day she wrote a letter addressed and sealed it and showed it toMarguerite. It was addressed "To my daughter Marguerite." She placedit under her pillow said she would rest and presently fell into a deepslumber. When she awoke all her children were kneeling round her inprayer and with them was Emmanuel."The hour has come dear children" she said gently "when we must sayfarewell. You are all here"--she looked about her--"and he..."Marguerite sent Emmanuel for her father and Balthazar's answer to thesummons was "I am coming."When Emmanuel returned Madame Claes sent him for his uncle the priestbidding him take the two boys with him then she turned to herdaughters. "God is taking me" she said. "What will become of you WhenI am gone Marguerite if you are ever in need of food read this letterwhich I have addressed to you. Love your father but shield your sisterand your brothers. It may be your duty to withstand him. He will wantmoney he will ask you for it. Do not forget your duty to your fatherbut remember your duty to your sister and brothers. Your father wouldnot injure his children of set purpose. He is noble he is good. He isfull of love for you. He is a great man working at a great task. Fill myplace. Do not cause him grief by reproaches never judge him bebetween him and those in your charge a gentle mediator."One of the servants had to go and bang on the laboratory door for Claes."Madame is dying" cried the indignant old body. "They are waiting foryou to administer the last sacrament.""I'll be there in a minute" answered Claes. When he entered the roomthe Abb de Solis and the children were kneeling round the mother's bed.His wife's face flushed at his entrance. With a loving smile she asked"Were you on the point of resolving nitrogen""I have done it" he answered with triumph "nitrogen is made up ofoxygen and------" He stopped checked by a murmur which roused him fromhis dream. "What did they say" he asked. "Are you really worse Whathas happened""This has happened" said the Abb "your wife is dying and you havekilled her."Priest and children withdrew."What does he mean" asked Claes.
comment136,"Dearest" she answered "your love was my life I could not livewithout it."He took her hand and kissed it."When have I not loved you" he asked.She refused to utter a reproach. For her children's sake she told thenarrative of his six years' search for the Absolute which had destroyedher life and swallowed up two million francs making him see the horrorof their desolation. "Have pity have pity" she cried "on ourchildren"Claes shouted for Lemulquinier and bade him go instantly to thelaboratory and smash everything. "I abandon science for ever" he cried."Too late" sighed the dying woman then she cried "Marguerite"The child came from the doorway horrified by the stricken face of hermother. Once again the loved name was repeated "Marguerite" loudly asthough to fix in her mind the charge laid upon her soul. It was the lastword uttered by Josephine. As the soul passed Balthazar from the footof the bed looked up to the pillows where Marguerite was sitting andtheir eyes met. The father trembled.In the sorrow of bereavement Marguerite discovered that she possessedtwo friends--Pierquin the notary and Emmanuel de Solis. Pierquinthought it would be a suitable thing to save the wreckage of the estateand marry the beautiful Marguerite whose family was doubly noble.Emmanuel offered to prepare Marguerite's brothers for college with atact and a charm which declared a fine nature. Pierquin was a man ofbusiness turned lover. Emmanuel was a lover turned by misfortune into aman of action._IV.--The Hour of Darkness_For some considerable time Balthazar avoided experimental chemistry andconfined himself to theoretical speculations. He took long walks on theramparts was gloomy restless and preoccupied at home. Margueriteendeavoured to distract his thoughts. One day the old servant Marthasaid to her "All is over with us master is on the road to hell again"And she pointed to clouds of smoke issuing from the laboratory chimney.Marguerite lived as carefully as a nun all expenses were cut down. Shedenied herself ordinary comforts to prepare for the crash. Thanks toEmmanuel the boys were now advancing in their studies and their futurewas at least unclouded. But Balthazar had developed the gambler'srecklessness. He sold a forest he mortgaged his house and silver hehad no more food than a nigger who sells his wife for a glass of brandyin the morning and weeps over his loss at night. Once Marguerite spoketo her father. She acknowledged that he was master that his childrenwould obey him at all costs but he must know that they scarcely hadbread in the house."Bread" he cried "no bread in the house of a Claes Where is all ourproperty then"She told him how he had sold everything."Then how do we live"She held up her needle.Time went on and fresh debts hammered at the door of the Maison Claes.At last Marguerite was obliged to face her father and charge him withmadness."Madness" he cried firing up and springing to his feet. There wassomething so majestic and commanding in his attitude that madeMarguerite tremble at his feet. "Your mother would never have used that
comment137,word she always attached due importance to my scientific researches."She could not bear his reproaches and fled from him. She felt that thetime had come for they were now on the verge of beggary to break theseal of her mother's letter. That letter expressed the most divine lovepraying that God would permit her spirit to be with Marguerite while sheread the words of this last message and it told her that the AbbSolis if living or his nephew held for her a sum of a hundred andseventy thousand francs and on this sum she must live and leave herfather if he refused to abandon his researches. "I could never have saidthese words" Josephine had written "not even on the brink of thegrave." And she entreated her child to be reverent in withstanding herfather and if resistance was inevitable to resist him on her knees. Theabb was dead but Emmanuel held the money. In their discussions aboutthe management of this sum the two young people drew closer together.The poor father brought to ruin confessed his madness and uttered theterrible despair of a beaten scientist. To comfort him Marguerite saidthat his debts would be paid with her money. His face lit up. "You havemoney Give it to me I will make you rich." Once more the madnessreturned.Emmanuel came with three thousand ducats in his pockets. They werehiding them in the hollow column of a pedestal when looking upMarguerite saw her father observing them. "I heard gold" he saidadvancing. To save her Emmanuel lied. He sinned against his consciencefor her sake. The money he said belonged to him and he had lent it toMarguerite. When he was gone Claes said "I must have that money.""If you take it" answered Marguerite "you will be a thief."He knelt to her she would not relent. He caressed her she called Godto look down upon them if he stole the money. He rose bade her asorrowful farewell and left the room. Something warned her she hurriedafter him to find him with a pistol at his head. "Take all I possess"she cried. Embracing her he promised that if he failed this time hewould deliver himself into her hands.Time passed and the Absolute was not discovered. A wealthy cousin ofClaes M. Conyncks came to Douai in his travelling carriage and soonafter he and Marguerite journeyed to Paris. When she returned it was toannounce that through M. Conynck's influence Balthazar had beenappointed receiver of taxes in Brittany and must set out at once totake up the appointment."You drive me out of my own house" he exclaimed with anger. At firsthe refused to go furious and indignant but she persisted and he hadto surrender. He went with Lemulquinier to his laboratory for the lasttime. The two old men were very sad as they released the gases andevaporated acids."Ah look" said Claes pausing before a capsule connected with thewires of a battery "if only we could watch out the end of thisexperiment Carbon and sulphur. Crystallisation should take place thecarbon might certainly result in a crystal ..."While Claes was in exile fortune came to the family. The son Gabrielassisted by M. Conyncks had made a large sum of money as the engineer
comment138,of a canal. Emmanuel de Solis had given Marguerite the fortune heinherited from ancestors in Spain. Pierquin who had turned hisattention to Marguerite's younger sister had proved himself kind to thefamily. Once again the Maison Claes was in prosperity with pictures onits walls and with handsome furniture in its state apartments.When Conyncks and Marguerite went to fetch the father they found himold and broken. The child was greatly touched by his appearance andquestioned him alone. She discovered that instead of saving money hewas heavily in debt and that he had been seeking the Absolute asindustriously in Brittany as in the attic of the Maison Claes.On his return the old man brightened and became glad. The ancient homegave him joy. He embraced his children looked around the happy house ofhis fathers and exclaimed "Ah Josephine if only you were here toadmire our Marguerite" The marriages of Marguerite and Felicie theyounger sister were hurried forward. During the reading of thecontracts Lemulquinier suddenly burst into the room crying "MonsieurMonsieur"Claes whispered to his daughter that the servant had lent him all hissavings--20000 francs--and had doubtless come to claim them on learningthat the master was once more a rich man. But Lemulquinier cried"Monsieur Monsieur""Well" demanded Claes.In the trembling hand of the old servant lay a diamond. Claes rushedtowards him."I went to the laboratory" began the servant--Claes looked up at himquickly as though to say "You were the first to go there"--"and Ifound in the capsule we left behind us this diamond The battery hasdone it without our help""Forgive me" cried Claes turning to his children and his guests. "Thiswill drive me mad Cursed exile God has worked in my laboratory and Iwas not there to see A miracle has taken place I might have seen it--Ihave missed it for ever" Suddenly he checked and advancing toMarguerite presented her with the diamond. "My angel" he said gently"this belongs to you." Then to the notary "Let us proceed."_V.--Discovery of the Absolute_Happiness reigned in the Maison Claes Balthazar conducted a few butinexpensive experiments and surrendered himself more and more to thehappiness of home life. It was as if the devil had been exorcised. Thedeath of relatives presently carried Emmanuel and Marguerite to Spainand their return was delayed by the birth of a child. When they didarrive in Flanders one morning towards the end of September they foundthe house in the Rue de Paris shut up and a ring at the bell brought noone to open the door. A shopkeeper near at hand said that M. Claes hadleft the house with Lemulquinier about an hour ago. Emmanuel went in
comment139,search of them while a locksmith opened the door of the Maison Claes.The house was as if the Absolute in the form of fire had passed throughall its rooms. Pictures furniture carpets hangings carvings--allwere swept clean away. Marguerite wept as she looked about her andforgave her father. She went downstairs to await his coming. How he musthave suffered in this bare house Fear filled her heart. Had his reasonfailed him Should she see him enter--a tottering and enfeebled old manbroken by the sufferings which he had borne so proudly for science Asshe waited the past rose before her eyes--the long past of struggleagainst their enemy the Absolute the long past when she was a childand her mother had been now so joyous and now so sorrowful.But she did not realise the calamity of her father's tragedy--a tragedyat once sublime and miserable. To the people of Douai he was not ascientific genius wrestling with Nature for her hidden mysteries but awicked old spendthrift greedy like a miser for the Philosopher's Stone.Everybody in Douai from the aristocracy to the bourgeoisie to thepeople knew all about old Claes "the alchemist." His home was calledthe "Devil's House." People pointed at him shouted after him in thestreet. Lemulquinier said that these were murmurs of applause forgenius.It happened that on this morning of Marguerite's return Balthazar andLemulquinier sat down on a bench in the Place Saint-Jacques to rest inthe sun. Some children passing to school saw the two old men talkedabout them laughed together and presently approached. One of them whocarried a basket and was eating a piece of bread and butter said toLemulquinier "Is it true you make diamonds and pearls"Lemulquinier patted the urchin's cheek."Yes little fellow it is true" he said. "Stick to your books getknowledge and perhaps we will give you some."They began to crowd round and became more daring."You should show respect to a great man" said Lemulquinier. At this thechildren laughed aloud and began to shout "Sorcerers Old sorcerers"Lemulquinier sprang up with his stick raised and the children beatinga retreat gathered up mud and stones. A workman seeing Lemulquiniermaking for the children with a stick came to their rescue with thedangerous cry "Down with sorcerers"Thus emboldened the children made a savage attack upon the two old menwith a shower of stones. At this moment Emmanuel came upon the scene. Hewas too late. Claes had been suddenly jerked from the ideal world inwhich he theorised and toiled into the real world of men. The shock wastoo much for him he sank into the arms of Lemulquinier paralysed.He lived in this condition for some time expressing all his affectionand gratitude to Marguerite by pressing her hand with his cold fingers.She refurnished the house and surrounded him with comforts. Hischildren were affectionate to him. They came and sat by his bedside andtook their meals in his room. His great happiness was listening toEmmanuel's reading of the newspapers.One night he became very much worse and the doctor was summoned inhaste. The stricken man made violent efforts to speak. His lipstrembled but no sound issued. His eyes were on fire with the thoughtshe could not utter. His face was haggard with agony. Drops ofperspiration oozed out of his forehead. His hands twitched convulsively
comment140,in the despair of his mind.On the following morning his children saluted him with deepest and mostlingering love knowing that the last hour was at hand. His face did notlight he made none of his usual responses to their tender affection.Pierquin signalled to Emmanuel and he broke the wrapper of thenewspaper and was about to read aloud in order to distract Claes whenhis eyes were arrested by the heading    DISCOVERY OF THE ABSOLUTEIn a low voice he read the intelligence to his wife. It narrated that afamous mathematician in Poland had made terms for selling the secret ofthe Absolute which he had discovered. As Emmanuel ceased to readMarguerite asked for the paper but Claes had heard the almost whisperedwords.Of a sudden the dying man lifted himself up on his elbows. To hisfrightened family his glance was like the flash of lightning. The fringeof hair above his forehead stood up every line in his countenancequivered with excitement a thrill of passion moved across his face andmade it sublime.He lifted a hand which was clenched with excitement and uttering thecry of Archimedes--"Eureka"--fell back with the heaviness of a deadbody and expired with an agonised groan. His eyes till the doctorclosed them expressed a frenzied despair. It was his agony that hecould not bequeath to science the solution of the great riddle which wasonly revealed to him as the veil was rent asunder by the hand of Death.                                   WILLIAM BECKFORDHistory of the Caliph Vathek     William Beckford son of the famous Lord Mayor was born at     Fonthill Wiltshire England Sept. 29 1759 and received his     education at first from a private tutor and then at Geneva.     On coming of age he inherited a million sterling and an     annual income of 100000 and three years later he married     the fourth Earl of Aboyne's daughter Lady Margaret Gordon     who died in May 1786. In 1787 Beckford's romance the     "History of the Caliph Vathek" appeared in its original     French an English translation of the work having been     published "anonymously and surreptitiously" in 1784. "Vathek"     was written by Beckford in 1781 or 1782 at a single sitting of     three days and two nights. Beckford was a great traveller and     a great connoisseur and collector both of pictures and of     books and apart from "Vathek" and some volumes of travels     he is best known for having secluded himself for twenty years     in the magnificent residence which he built in Fonthill. He     died on May 2 1844._I.--Vathek and the Magic Sabres_Vathek ninth caliph of the race of the Abassides was the son ofMotassem and the grandson of Haroun al Raschid. From an early accessionto the throne and the talents he possessed to adorn it his subjectswere induced to expect that his reign would be long and happy. Hisfigure was pleasing and majestic but when he was angry one of his eyesbecame so terrible that no person could bear it and the wretch uponwhom it was fixed instantly fell backward and sometimes expired. Forfear however of depopulating his dominions and making his palacedesolate he but rarely gave way to his anger.Being much addicted to the pleasures of the table he sought by hisaffability to procure agreeable companions and he succeeded the betteras his generosity was unbounded and his indulgences were unrestrainedfor he was by no means scrupulous nor did he think with the caliphOmar Ben Abdalaziz that it was necessary to make a hell of this worldto enjoy paradise in the next. He surpassed in magnificence all hispredecessors. The palace of Alkoremmi which his father Motassem haderected on the hill of Pied Horses and which commanded the whole cityof Samarah was in his idea far too scanty. He added therefore fivewings or rather other palaces which he destined for the particulargratification of each of his senses.But the unquiet and impetuous disposition of the caliph would not allowhim to rest there he had studied so much for amusement in the lifetime
comment141,of his father as to acquire a great deal of knowledge though not asufficiency to satisfy himself--for he wished to know everything evensciences that did not exist. He was fond of engaging in disputes withthe learned and with the orthodox but liked them not to push theiropposition with warmth he stopped with presents the mouths of thosewhose mouths could be stopped while others whom his liberality wasunable to subdue he sent to prison to cool their blood a remedy thatoften succeeded.The great prophet Mohammed whose vicars the caliphs are beheld withindignation from his abode in the seventh heaven the irreligious conductof such a vice-regent."Let us leave him to himself" said he to the genii who are alwaysready to receive his commands. "Let us see to what lengths his folly andimpiety will carry him. If he run into excess we shall know how tochastise him. Assist him therefore to complete the tower which inimitation of Nimrod he hath begun not like that great warrior toescape being drowned but from the insolent curiosity of penetrating thesecrets of heaven he will not divine the fate that awaits him."The genii obeyed and when the workmen had raised their structures acubit in the daytime two cubits more were added in the night. Vathekfancied that even invisible matter showed a forwardness to subserve hisdesigns and his pride arrived at its height when having ascended forthe first time the eleven thousand stairs of his tower he cast his eyesbelow and beheld men not larger than pismires mountains than shellsand cities than beehives. He now passed most of his nights on the summitof his tower till he became an adept in the mysteries of astrology andimagined that the planets had disclosed to him the most marvellousadventures which were to be accomplished by an extraordinary personagefrom a country altogether unknown.Prompted by motives of curiosity he had always been courteous tostrangers but from this instant he redoubled his attention and orderedit to be announced by sound of trumpet through all the streets ofSamarah that no one of his subjects on pain of displeasure shouldeither lodge or detain a traveller but forthwith bring him to thepalace.Not long after this there arrived in the city a hideous man who toVathek's view displayed slippers which enabled the feet to walk knivesthat cut without a motion of the hand and sabres which dealt the blowat the person they were wished to strike the whole enriched with gemsthat were hitherto unknown. The sabres whose blades emitted a dazzlingradiance fixed more than all the caliph's attention who promisedhimself to decipher at his leisure the uncouth characters engraven ontheir sides. Without therefore demanding their price he ordered allthe coined gold to be brought from his treasury and commanded themerchant to take what he pleased. The stranger complied with modesty andsilence but having maintained an obstinate silence on all the pointson which the caliph questioned him he was committed to prison fromwhich he was found the next day to have vanished leaving his keepersdead.
comment142,Vathek was at first enraged but having been comforted by his motherthe Princess Carathis who was a Greek and an adept in all the sciencesand systems of her country he issued at her suggestion a proclamationpromising the liberality for which he was renowned to whoever shoulddecipher the characters on the sabres and eventually had thegratification of meeting with an old man who read them as follows "Wewere made where everything good is made we are the least of the wondersof a place where all is wonderful and deserving the sight of the firstpotentate on earth." Unfortunately however when the old man wasordered the next morning to re-read the inscription he was then foundto interpret it as denouncing "Woe to the rash mortal who seeks to knowthat of which he should remain ignorant." "And woe to thee" cried thecaliph in a burst of indignation and telling him to take his rewardand begone._II.--The Caliph's Strange Adventures_It was not long before Vathek discovered abundant reason for regrettinghis precipitation. He plainly perceived that the characters on thesabres changed every day and the anxiety caused by his failure todecipher them or to read anything from the stars brought on a feverwhich deprived him of his appetite and tormented him with an absolutelyinsatiable thirst. From this distress he was at length delivered by ameeting with the stranger who cured him by giving him to drink of aphial of red and yellow mixture. But when this insolent person at abanquet given in his honour burst into shouts of laughter on beingasked to declare of what drugs the salutary liquor had been compoundedand from what place the sabres had come Vathek kicked him from thesteps and repeating the blow persisted with such assiduity as incitedall present to follow his example. The stranger collected into a ballrolled out of the palace followed by Vathek the court and the wholecity and after passing through all the public places rolled onwardsto the Plain of Catoul traversed the valley at the foot of the mountainof the Four Fountains and bounded into the chasm formed there by thecontinual fall of the waters.Vathek would have followed the perfidious giaour had not an invisibleagency arrested his progress and that of the multitude and he was somuch struck by the whole circumstance that he ordered his tents to bepitched on the very edge of the precipice. After keeping several vigilsthere he was accosted one night by the voice of the giaour who amidthe darkness caused by a total eclipse of the moon and the starsoffered to bring him to the palace of subterranean fire where he shouldbehold the treasures which the stars had promised him and the talismansthat control the world if he would abjure Mohammed adore theterrestrial influences and satiate the stranger's thirst with the bloodof fifty of the most beautiful Samarahite boys.The unhappy caliph lavished his promises in the utmost profusion and byarranging for the celebration near the chasm of some juvenile sports
comment143,which were not concluded till twilight was able to make the direfullibation. As the boys came up one by one to receive their prizes hepushed them into the gulf the dreadful device being executed with somuch dexterity that the boy who was approaching him remained unconsciousof the fate of his forerunner.The popular tumult roused by this atrocity having been appeased by theprincess who possessed the most consummate skill in the art ofpersuasion there was offered on the tower a burnt sacrifice to theinfernal deities the main ingredients of which were mummiesrhinoceros' horns oil of the most venomous serpents various aromaticwoods and one hundred and forty of the caliph's most faithful subjects.These preliminaries having been settled a parchment was discovered inwhich Vathek was thanked for his burnt offering and told to set forthwith a magnificent retinue for Istakar where he would receive thediadem of Gian Ben Gian the talismans of Soliman and the treasures ofthe pre-Adamite sultans. But he was warned not to enter any dwelling onhis route.Vathek and the cavalcade set out and for three days all went well. Buton the fourth a storm burst upon them the frightful roar of wild beastsresounded at a distance and they soon perceived in the forest glaringeyes that could only belong to devils or tigers. Fire destroyed theirprovisions and they would have starved had not two dwarfs who dwelt ashermits on the top of some rocks received divine intimation of theirplight and revealed it to their emir Fakreddin. The dwarfs wereentertained caressed and seated with great ceremony on little cushionsof state. But they clambered up the sides of the caliph's seat andplacing themselves each on one of his shoulders began to whisperprayers in his ears and his patience was almost exhausted when theacclamations of the troops announced the approach of Fakreddin. Hehastened to their assistance but being punctiliously religious andlikewise a great dealer in compliments he made an harangue five timesmore prolix and insipid than his harbingers had already delivered.At length however all got in motion and they descended from theheights to the valley by the large steps which the emir had cut in therocks and reached a building of hewn stone overspread by palm-trees andcrowned with nine domes. Beneath one of these domes the caliph wasentertained with excellent sherbet with sweetbreads stewed in milk ofalmonds and other delicacies of which he was amazingly fond.But unfortunately the sight of the emir's young daughter tempted theprophet's vice-regent to violate the rites of hospitality. Vathek fellviolently in love with Nouronihar who was sprightly as an antelope andfull of wanton gaiety and though she was contracted to her cousin anddearly beloved companion Gulchenrouz he demanded her hand fromFakreddin who rather than force his daughter to break her affiancespresented his sabre to Vathek. "Strike your unhappy host" he said. "He
comment144,has lived long enough if he sees the prophet's vice-regent violate therites of hospitality." Nouronihar fell down in a swoon and of thisswoon the emir took advantage to carry out a scheme which should deliverhim from his difficulties. He gave out that both the children had diedfrom the effect of the caliph's glances and having administered tothem a narcotic powder that would give them the appearance of death forthree days had them conveyed away to the shores of a desolate lakewhere attended by the dwarfs they were put upon a meagre diet and toldthat they were in the other world expiating the little faults of whichtheir love was the cause.But Nouronihar remembering a dream in which she was told that she wasdestined to be the caliph's wife and thereby to possess the carbuncleof Giamsched and the treasures of the pre-Adamite sultans indulgeddoubts on the mode of her being and scarcely could believe that she wasdead. She rose one morning while all were asleep and having wanderedsome distance from the lake discovered that she knew the district.This fact and a meeting with Vathek convinced her that she was aliveand submitting to the caliph's embraces she consented to become hisbride and to go with him to the subterranean palace._III.--The Palace of Subterranean Fire_When Princess Carathis heard of the dissolute conduct of her son shesent for Morakanabad."Let me expire in flames" she cried.Having said this she whirled herself round in a magical way strikingpoor Morakanabad in such a way as caused him to recoil. Then she orderedher great camel Aboufaki to be brought and attended by her twohideous and one-eyed negresses Nerkes and Cafour set out to surprisethe lovers. She burst in upon them foaming with indignation and saidto Vathek "Free thyself from the arms of this paltry doxy drown her inthe water before me and instantly follow my guidance." But Vathekreplied civilly but decisively that he was taking Nouronihar with himand the princess having heard her declare that she would follow himbeyond the Kaf in the land of the Afrits was appeased and pronouncedNouronihar a girl of both courage and science.With a view however of preventing any further trouble arising fromGulchenrouz of whose affection for his cousin Vathek had informed hershe sought to capture the boy intending to sacrifice him to the giaour.But as he was fleeing from her he fell into the arms of a genius thesame good old genius who happening on the cruel giaour at the instantof his growling in the horrible chasm had rescued the fifty littlevictims which the impiety of Vathek had devoted to his maw. The geniusplaced Gulchenrouz in a nest higher than the clouds and there kept himever young.Nor was this the only hope of the princess's that was doomed to befrustrated. She learnt from her astrolabes and instruments of magic thatMotavakel availing himself of the disgust which was now inveterateagainst his brother had incited commotions among the populace madehimself master of the palace and actually invested the great tower. So
comment145,she reluctantly abandoned the idea of accompanying Vathek to Istakarand returned to Samarah while he attended by Nouronihar resumed hismarch and quickly reached the valley of Rocnabad. Here the poor Santonsfilled with holy energy having bustled to light up wax torches in theiroratories and to expand the Koran on their ebony desks went forth tomeet the caliph with baskets of honeycomb dates and melons. Vathekgave them but a surly reception. "Fancy not" said he "that you candetain me your presents I condescend to accept but beg you will let mebe quiet for I am not overfond of resisting temptation. Yet as it isnot decent for personages so reverend to return on foot and as you havenot the appearance of expert riders my eunuchs shall tie you on yourasses with the precaution that your backs be not turned towards me forthey understand etiquette."Even this outrage could not persuade Vathek's good genius to desert himand he made one final effort to save the caliph from the fate awaitinghim. Disguised as a shepherd and pouring forth from his flute suchmelodies as softened even the heart of Vathek he confronted him in hispath and warned him so solemnly against pursuing his journey that whennight fell almost every one of his attendants had deserted him. ButVathek in his obduracy went on and at length arrived at the mountainwhich contains the vast ruins of Istakar and the entrance to the realmof Eblis.Nouronihar and he having ascended the steps of a vast staircase ofblack marble reached the terrace which was flagged with squares ofmarble and resembled a smooth expanse of water. There by the moonlightthey read an inscription which proclaimed that despite the fact thatVathek had violated the conditions of the parchment he and Nouroniharwould be allowed to enter the palace of subterranean fire.Scarcely had these words been read when the mountain trembled and therock yawned and disclosed within it a staircase of polished marble downwhich they descended. At the bottom they found their way impeded by ahuge portal of ebony which opening at the giaour's command revealedto them a place which though roofed with a vaulted ceiling was sospacious and lofty that at first they took it for an immeasurable plain.In the midst of this immense hall a vast multitude was incessantlypassing who severally kept their right hands on their hearts withoutonce regarding anything about them. They had all the livid paleness ofdeath their eyes deep-sunk in their sockets resembled thosephosphoric meteors that glimmer by night in places of interment. Somestalked slowly along absorbed in profound reverie some shrieking withagony ran furiously about like tigers wounded with poisonous arrowswhilst others grinding their teeth in rage foamed along more franticthan the wildest maniacs. They all avoided each other and thoughsurrounded by a multitude that no one could number each wandered atrandom unheedful of the rest as if alone on a desert no foot hadtrodden.Vathek and Nouronihar frozen with terror at a sight so baleful
comment146,demanded of the giaour what these appearances might mean and why theseambulating spectres never withdrew their hands from their hearts."Perplex not yourselves" replied he bluntly "with so much at onceyou will soon be acquainted with all. Let us haste and present you toEblis."They continued their way through the multitude and after some timeentered a vast tabernacle carpeted with the skins of leopards and filledwith an infinity of elders with streaming beards and Afrits in completearmour all of whom had prostrated themselves before the ascent of alofty eminence on the top of which upon a globe of fire sat theformidable Eblis. He received Vathek's and Nouronihar's homage andinvited them to enjoy whatever the palace afforded--the treasures of thepre-Adamite sultans and their bickering sabres and those talismans whichcompel the Dives to open the subterranean expanses of the mountain ofKaf.The giaour then conducted them to a hall of great extent covered with alofty dome round which appeared fifty portals of bronze secured withas many fastenings of iron. A funereal gloom prevailed over the wholescene. Here upon two beds of incorruptible cedar lay recumbent thefleshless forms of pre-Adamite kings who had been monarchs of the wholeearth they still possessed enough of life to be conscious of theirdeplorable condition their eyes retained a melancholy motion theyregarded each other with looks of the deepest dejection each holdinghis right hand motionless on his heart. Soliman Ben Daoud the mosteminent of them told Vathek the story of his great state of hisworship of fire and the hosts of the sky and of heaven's vengeance uponhim. "I am in torments ineffable torments" said he. "An unrelentingfire preys upon my heart." Having uttered this exclamation Solimanraised his hands towards heaven in token of supplication and the caliphdiscerned through his bosom which was as transparent as crystal hisheart enveloped in flames. At a sight so full of horror Nouronihar fellback like one petrified into the arms of Vathek who cried out with aconvulsive sob "O Mohammed remains there no more mercy""None none" replied the malicious Dive. "Know miserable prince thouart now in the abode of vengeance and despair A few days are allottedthee as respite and then thy heart also shall be kindled like those ofthe other worshippers of Eblis."This indeed was the dreadful fate of Vathek and Nouronihar a fateindeed to which the Princess Carathis was also most righteouslycondemned for Vathek knowing that the principles by which his motherhad perverted his youth had been the cause of his perdition summonedher to the palace of subterranean fire and enrolled her among thevotaries of Eblis. Carathis entered the dome of Soliman and she toomarched in triumph through the vapour of perfumes.                                   APHRA BEHNOroonoko the Royal Slave     In her introduction to "Oroonoko" Mrs. Aphra Behn states     that her strange and romantic tale is founded on facts of     many of which she was an eye-witness. This is true. She was     born at Wye England July 10 1640 the daughter it is said     of a barber. As a child she went out to Dutch Guiana then an     English colony named after the Surinam River returning to     England about 1658. After the death of her husband in 1666     she was dispatched as a spy to Antwerp by Charles II. and it     was she who first warned that monarch of the Dutch     Government's intention to send a fleet up the Thames. She died     on April 16 1689 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. It was     while in Dutch Guiana that she met Oroonoko in the     circumstances described in the story. No doubt she has     idealised her hero somewhat but she does not seem to have     exaggerated the extraordinary adventures of the young African     chief. In the licentious age of the Restoration when she had     become famous--or rather notorious--as a writer of unseemly     plays she astonished the town and achieved real fame by
comment147,     relating the story of Oroonoko's life. There are few plots of     either plays or novels so striking as that of "Oroonoko." It     is the first of those romances of the outlands which from     the days of Defoe to the days of Mr. Rudyard Kipling have     been one of the glories of English literature._I.--The Stolen Bride_I do not pretend to entertain the reader with a feigned hero whoseadventures I can manage according to my fancy. Of many of the eventshere set down I was an eye-witness and what I did not see myself Ilearnt from the mouth of Oroonoko. When I made his acquaintance I wasliving in that part of our South American colony called Surinam whichwe lately ceded to the Dutch--a great mistake I think for the land wasfertile and the natives were friendly and many Englishmen had set upsugar plantations which they worked by means of negroes. Most of theseslaves came from that part of Africa known as Coromantien. TheCoromantiens being very warlike were continually fighting othernations and they always had many captives ready to be sold as slaves toour planters.The king of Coromantien was a hundred years of age. All his sons hadfallen in battle and only one of them had left behind him an heir.Oroonoko as the young prince was called was a very intelligent andhandsome negro and as his grandfather engaged a Frenchman of wit andlearning to teach him he received an education better than that of manyEuropean princes. This I can speak of from my own knowledge as I haveoften conversed with him. He had a great admiration for the ancientRomans and in everything but the colour of his skin he reminded me ofthose heroes of antiquity.His nose was finely curved and his lips too were well shaped insteadof being thick as those of most Africans are. As the king ofCoromantien by reason of his great age was unable to bear arms heentrusted his chief headman with the duty of training Oroonoko in thearts of war. For two years the young prince was away fighting with apowerful inland nation the chief headman was killed in a fierce battleand Oroonoko succeeded him in the command of the army. He was then onlyseventeen years of age but he quickly brought the long war to asuccessful conclusion and returned home with a multitude of captives.The greater part of these he gave to his grandfather and the rest hetook to Imoinda the daughter and only child of the chief headman astrophies of her father's victories.Imoinda was a marvellously beautiful girl her features like those ofOroonoko were regular and noble and more European than African. It wasa case of love at first sight on both sides and the young princepresented the lovely maiden with a hundred and fifty slaves andreturned home in a fever of passion. It was necessary for him to obtainhis grandfather's consent to his marriage but for some days he was soperplexed by the flood of strange new feelings surging in his youngheart that he remained silent and moody.His followers however were loud in their praises of Imoinda. Theyextolled her ravishing charms even in the presence of the old king sothat nothing else was talked of but Imoinda. Oroonoko's love rapidlybecame too strong for him to control and one night he went secretly to
comment148,the house of his beloved and wooed her with such fervency of soul thateven she was astonished by it. It was the savage custom of his countryfor a king to have a hundred wives as his grandfather had but Oroonokowas an enlightened and chivalrous man."Never Imoinda" he cried "shall you have a rival. You are the onlywoman I shall love the only woman I shall marry. Come my darling andlet us try and raise our people up by our example."Imoinda was naturally overjoyed to become the wife of so noble andcultivated a prince and she waited the next morning in a state ofdelicious excitement for Oroonoko to return and claim her as his bride.But to her dismay and horror four headmen with their servants came atdaybreak to her house with a royal veil. This is a rudely embroideredcloth which the king of Coromantien sends to any lady whom he has a mindto make his wife. After she is covered with it the maid is secured forthe king's otan or harem and it is death to disobey the royal summons.Trembling and almost fainting Imoinda was compelled to suffer herselfto be covered and led away to the old king. His imagination had beenexcited by the wild way in which the followers of his grandson hadpraised the beauty of the maiden and carried away by unnaturaljealousy he had resolved in a fit of madness to possess her at allcosts. In spite of all he had heard he was amazed by her loveliness.Rising up from his throne he came towards her with outstretched arms."I am already married" she cried bursting into tears and throwingherself at his feet. "Do not dishonour me Let me return to my ownhouse.""Who has dared to marry the daughter of my chief headman without myconsent" said the old king his eyes rolling in anger. "Whoever he ishe shall die at once."Imoinda began to fear for Oroonoko and tried to undo the effect of herwords."He--he is not exactly my husband yet" she stammered. "But oh I lovehim I love him And I have promised to marry him.""That's nothing" said the king his eyes now lighting up with pleasure."You must be my wife."In the afternoon Oroonoko who had gone in search of Imoinda returned.Having heard that she had received the royal veil he came in so violenta rage that his men had great trouble to save him from killing himself."What can I do" he cried desperately. "Even if I slew my grandfather Icould not now make Imoinda my wife."_II.--A White Man's Treachery_By the custom of the country it would have been so great a crime tomarry a woman whom Us grandfather had taken that Oroonoko's people wouldprobably have risen up against him. But one of his men pointed out thatas Imoinda was his lawful wife by solemn contract he was really theinjured man and might if he would take her back--the breach of thelaw being on his grandfather's side. Thereupon the young princeresolved to recover her and in the night he entered the otan or royalharem by a secret passage and made his way to the apartment ofImoinda. Had he found the old king there he no doubt would have killedhim but happily the lovely maid was alone and quietly sleeping inher bed. He softly awakened her and she trembled with joy and fear athis boldness. But they had not been long together when a sudden noisewas heard and a band of armed men with spears burst into the room."Back" shouted the young prince lifting up his battle-axe. "Back allof you Do you not know Oroonoko""Yes" said one of the men. "The king has sent us to take you dead oralive."But when Oroonoko attacked them they allowed him to fight his way outof the otan but tore the maid from his arms and took her to the king.The old man was blind with rage and seizing a spear he staggered tohis feet determined to kill her by his own hand. But Imoinda was in nomood to die. She knew that her lover had fled to his camp and intendedto return at the head of a large army and rescue her by main force. Ifshe could only calm the anger of the old king for a few days all wouldbe well. So with the guile of a woman she flung herself at the king'sfeet protesting in a flood of tears that Oroonoko had broken into herroom and taken her by force.
comment149,"Very well" said the old king with a cruel look in his eyes "I willforgive you. Having received the royal veil you cannot marry mygrandson. On the other hand since he has entered your room you cannotremain any longer in the otan. You must be sent out of the country."And early the next morning some of his servants were commanded to dressher so that she could not be recognised and then she was carried downto the shore and sold to the captain of a slave ship.The king did not dare to tell his grandson that he had sold Imoinda as aslave for the Coromantiens justly reckon slavery as something worsethan death so he sent a messenger to say that she was dead. At firstOroonoko was minded to attack his grandfather but better feelingsprevailed and he led his army against a hostile nation resolved toperish on the battlefield. So desperate was his courage that he defeatedhis far more numerous foes and took a great multitude of them captives.Many of these he sold to the captain of a slave-ship then lying offCoromantien. When the bargain was concluded the captain invited theprince and all his attendants to a banquet on board his ship and soplied them with wine that being unaccustomed to drink of this sortthey were overcome by it.When Oroonoko recovered his senses he found himself chained up in adark room and all his men were groaning in fetters around him. Thecunning slave-dealer had got out of paying for his cargo of slaves andincreased their number by carrying off the young prince and hiscompanions. This was how I came to meet Oroonoko. The unscrupulousslave-dealer brought him to Surinam and sold him and seventeen of hisfollowers to our overseer a young Cornishman named Trefry.Trefry a man of great wit and fine learning was attracted by the noblebearing of Oroonoko and treated him more as a friend than as a servant.And when to his great astonishment he found that the young prince washis equal in scholarship and could converse with him in EnglishFrench and Spanish he asked him how it was he had become a slave.Oroonoko then related the story of the slave-dealer's treachery andTrefry was so moved by it that he promised to find the means to free him
comment150,from slavery and enable him to return to Coromantien.When Oroonoko arrived at our plantation all our negroes left off workand came to see him. When they saw that he was really the great princeof Coromantien who had conquered them in battle and sold them intoslavery they cast themselves at his feet crying out in their ownlanguage "Live O king Long live O king" They kissed his feet andpaid him divine homage--for such is the nature of this people thatinstead of bearing him any grudge for selling them into captivity theywere filled with awe and veneration for him.Mr. Trefry was glad to find Oroonoko's statement of his royal rankconfirmed by the adoration of all the slaves."There's one girl" he said "who did not come to greet you. I am sureyou will be delighted to find you have so beautiful a subject. If it ispossible for anyone to console you for the loss of Imoinda she will doso. To tell the truth I've been in love with her myself but I foundthat I could not win her.""I do not want to see her" said Oroonoko. "If I go back to CoromantienI will not take any woman with me. I vowed to Imoinda that I would neverhave any wife but her and though she is dead I shall keep my vow."The next morning Trefry took Oroonoko for a walk and by design broughthim to the house of the beautiful slave."Clemene" he said "did you not hear that one of the princes of yourpeople arrived in Surinam yesterday However you may fly from all whitemen you surely ought to pay some respect to him."Oroonoko started when a girl came out with her head bowed down as ifshe had resolved never to raise her eyes again to the face of a man."Imoinda Imoinda" Oroonoko cried after a moment's silence. "Imoinda"It was she. She looked up at the sound of his voice and then totteredand fell down in a swoon and Oroonoko caught her in his arms. Bydegrees she came to herself and it is needless to tell with whattransport what ecstasies of joy the lovers beheld each other. Mr.Trefry was infinitely pleased by this happy conclusion of the prince'smisadventures and leaving the lovers to themselves he came to ParhamHouse and gave me an account of all that had happened. In theafternoon to the great joy of all the negroes Oroonoko and Imoindawere married. I was invited to the wedding and I assured Oroonoko thathe and his wife would be set free as soon as the lord-governor of thecolony returned to Surinam._III.--The Taint of Slavery_Unhappily the lord-governor was delayed for some months in the islandsand Oroonoko became impatient. After the trick played upon him by thecaptain of the slave-ship he had become exceedingly suspicious of thehonesty and good faith of white men. He was afraid that the overseerwould keep him and his wife until their child was born and make a slaveof it. At last he grew so moody and sullen that many persons fearedthat he would incite the negroes to a mutiny. In order to soothe theprince I invited him and Imoinda to stay at my house where Ientertained them to the best of my ability."Surely" I said to him "you do not suspect that we will break our wordwith you Only wait patiently my friend till the lord-governorarrives and you will be permitted to return to your own kingdom.""You do not understand" Oroonoko replied. "I am angry with myself forremaining so long a slave. What Do you white people think that I the
comment151,king of Coromantien can be treated like the captives that I have takenin war and sold to you Had it not been for Imoinda I would long sincehave been free or dead."Unfortunately both for me and Oroonoko my father who had beenappointed lieutenant-general of the West Indies and Guiana died at seaon his way to Surinam and the new lord-governor was long in arriving.In the meantime a child was born to Imoinda and all the negroes tothe number of 300 came together to celebrate the event. Oroonokobeside himself with anger because his child had been born into slaverymade a harangue to the assembled multitude."Why should we be slaves to these white men" he cried. "Have theyconquered us nobly in battle Are we become their captives by the chanceof war No We have been bought and sold like monkeys or cattle to aset of cowards and rogues who have been driven out of their own countryby reason of their villainy Shall we let vile creatures such as theseflog us and bruise us as they please""No no" shouted the negroes. "Be our king Oroonoko and make us afree nation"Thereupon he commanded them to seize what arms they could and tie upeverything they wanted in their hammocks and sling these over theirshoulders and march out with their wives and children. The nextmorning when the overseers went to call their slaves up to work theyfound they had fled. By noon 600 militiamen set out in search of thefugitives. The negroes were forced to travel slowly by reason of theirwomen and children and at the end of two days the militiamen led bythe new lord-governor caught them up and surrounded them. In the battlethat ensued several Englishmen were killed and a great many woundedbut as they outnumbered the negroes and were much better armed theydefeated them. Even then Oroonoko would not surrender. But thelord-governor parleyed with him and promised that he would give him andhis wife and child a free passage to Coromantien in the first ship thattouched on the coast.On this Oroonoko surrendered. But to his horror and surprise he wastaken back to Surinam and tied to a stake at the whipping-place andlashed until the very flesh was torn from his bones. His captors thenbound him in chains and cast him into a prison. From this however hewas at last rescued by Mr. Trefry. But the shame and the torture hadunhinged his fine mind. He led Imoinda and his child into a forest and
comment152,asked his wife whether she would prefer to remain the slave of the whitedevils or die at once by his hand. Imoinda begged him rather to killher and Oroonoko did so. But instead of putting an end to himself theprince determined to die fighting. He turned back from the forestfiercely resolved to search out the lord-governor and slay him butfalling into the hands of the militiamen he was killed in a veryhorrible manner.I can only say that this negro was the noblest and gentlest man I evermet. It needs more genius than I possess to praise him as he deservesyet I hope the reputation of my pen is considerable enough to make hisname survive to all ages with that of the beautiful brave andconstant Imoinda.                                   CYRANO DE BERGERACA Voyage to the Moon     Savinien Cyrano de Bergerac has recently acquired a new lease     of fame as the hero of Edmond Rostand's romantic comedy.     Probably he is better known in France as a fighter than as a     wit and a poet. Born about 1620 he entered the Regiment of     the Guards in his nineteenth year and quickly became renowned     for his bravery. He was an indefatigable duellist when he was     about twenty years old he found a hundred men assembled to     insult one of his friends and he attacked them killed two     mortally wounded seven and dispersed all the rest. He died at     Paris in 1655 struck by a huge beam falling into the street.     As an author he was strangely underrated by his     fellow-countrymen. Molire was the only man who really     appreciated him. For some centuries his works have been more     esteemed in England than in France. Many English writers from     Dean Swift to Samuel Butler the author of "Erewhon" have     been inspired by his "Voyage to the Moon" the English     equivalent of the original title being "Comic History of the     States and Empires of the Moon and the Sun." This entertaining     satire is as fresh as it was on the day it was written flying     machines and gramophones for instance are curiously modern.     His inimitable inventiveness makes him the most delightful of     French writers between Montaigne and Molire._I.--Arrival on the Moon_After many experiments I constructed a flying machine and sitting ontop of it I boldly launched myself in the air from the crest of amountain. I had scarcely risen more than half a mile when something wentwrong with my machine and it shot back to the earth. But to myastonishment and joy instead of descending with it I continued to risethrough the calm moonlight air. For three-quarters of an hour I mountedhigher and higher. Then suddenly all the weight of my body seemed tofall upon my head. I was no longer rising quietly from the Earth buttumbling headlong on to the Moon. At last I crashed through a tree andbreaking my fall among its leafy yielding boughs I landed gently onthe grass below.I found myself in the midst of a wild and beautiful forest so full of
comment153,the sweet music of singing-birds that it seemed as if every leaf onevery tree had the tongue and figure of a nightingale. The ground wascovered with unknown lovely flowers with a magical scent. As soon as Ismelt it I became twenty years younger. My thin grey hairs changed intothick brown wavy tresses my wrinkled face grew fresh and rosy and myblood flowed through my veins with the speed and vigour of youth.I was surprised to find no trace of human habitation in the forest. Butin wandering about I came upon two strong great animals about twelvecubits long. One of them came towards me and the other fled into theforest. But it quickly returned with seven hundred other beasts. As theyapproached me I perceived that they were creatures with a human shapewho however went on all-fours like some gigantic kind of monkey. Theyshouted with admiration when they saw me and one of them took me up bythe neck and flung me on his back and galloped with me into a greattown.When I saw the splendid buildings of the city I recognised my mistake.The four-footed creatures were really enormous men. Seeing that I wenton two legs they would not believe that I was a man like themselves.They thought I was an animal without any reasoning power and theyresolved to send me to their queen who was fond of collecting strangeand curious monsters.All this of course I did not understand at the time. It took me somemonths to learn their language. These men of the Moon have two dialectsone for the nobility the other for the common people. The language ofthe nobility is a kind of music it is certainly a very pleasant meansof expression. They are able to communicate their thoughts by lutes andother musical instruments quite as well as by the voice.When twenty or thirty of them meet together to discuss some matter theycarry on the debate by the most harmonious concert it is possible toimagine.The common people however talk by agitating different parts of theirbodies. Certain movements constitute an entire speech. By shaking afinger a hand or an arm for instance they can say more than we canin a thousand words. Other motions such as a wrinkle on the forehead ashiver along a muscle serve to design words. As they use all their bodyin speaking in this fashion they have to go naked in order to makethemselves clearly understood. When they are engaged in an excitingconversation they seem to be creatures shaken by some wild fever.Instead of sending me at once to the Queen of the Moon the man who hadcaptured me earned a considerable amount of money by taking me everyafternoon to the houses of the rich people. There I was compelled tojump and make grimaces and stand in ridiculous attitudes in order toamuse the crowds of guests who had been invited to see the antics of thenew animal.But one day as my master was pulling the rope around my neck to make merise up and divert the company a man came and asked me in Greek who Iwas. Full of joy at meeting someone with whom I could talk I related tohim the story of my voyage from the Earth."I cannot understand" I said "how it was I rose up to the Moon when mymachine broke down and fell to the Earth.""That is easily explained" he said. "You had got within the circle oflunar influence in which the Moon exerts a sort of sucking action onthe fat of the body. The same thing often happens to me. Like you I am
comment154,a stranger on the Moon. I was born on the Sun but being of a rovingdisposition I like to explore one planet after another. I havetravelled a good deal in Europe and conversed with several personswhose names you no doubt know. I remember that I was once famous inancient Greece as the Demon of Socrates.""Then you are a spirit" I exclaimed."A kind of spirit" he replied. "I was one of the large company of theMen of the Sun who used to inhabit the Earth under the names of oraclesnymphs woodland elves and fairies. But we abandoned our world in thereign of the Emperor Augustus your people then became so gross andstupid that we could no longer delight in their society. Since then Ihave stayed on the Moon. I find its inhabitants more enlightened thanthe inhabitants of the Earth.""I don't" I exclaimed. "Look how they treat me as if I were a wildbeast I am sure that if one of their men of science voyaged to theEarth he would be better received than I am here.""I doubt it" said the Man of the Sun. "Your men of science would havehim killed stuffed and put in a glass case in a museum."_II.--The Garb of Shame_At this point our conversation was broken off by my keeper. He saw thatthe company was tired of my talk which seemed to them mere grunting. Sohe pulled my rope and made me dance and caper until the spectatorsached with laughter.Happily the next morning the Man of the Sun opened my cage and put meon his back and carried me away."I have spoken to the King of the Moon" he said "and he has commandedthat you should be taken to his court and examined by his learneddoctors."As my companion went on four feet he was able to travel as fast as aracehorse and we soon arrived at another town where we put up at aninn for dinner. I followed him into a magnificently furnished hall anda servant asked me what I would begin with."Some soup" I replied.I had scarcely pronounced the words when I smelt a very succulent broth.I rose up to look for the source of this agreeable smell but mycompanion stopped me."What do you want to walk away for" said he. "Stay and finish yoursoup.""But where is the soup" I said."Ah" he replied. "This is the first meal you have had on the Moon. Yousee the people here only live on the smell of food. The fine lunar artof cookery consists in collecting the exhalations that come from cookedmeat and bottling them up. Then at meal-time the various jars areuncorked one after the other until the appetites of the diners aresatisfied.""It is no doubt an exquisite way of eating" I said "but I am afraidI shall starve on it.""Oh no you will not" said he. "You will soon find that a man cannourish himself as well by his nose as by his mouth."And so it was. After smelling for a quarter of an hour a variety ofrich appetising vapours I rose up quite satisfied.In the afternoon I was taken to the palace of the king and examined bythe greatest men of science on the Moon. In spite of all that my friendhad said on my behalf I was adjudged to be a mere animal and againshut up in a cage. The king queen and courtiers spent a considerabletime every day watching me and with the help of the Man of the Sun Isoon learned to speak a little of their music-language. This caused agreat deal of surprise. Several persons began to think that I was reallya man who had been dwarfed and weakened from want of nourishment.But the learned doctors again examined me and decided that as I didnot walk on four legs I must be a new kind of featherless parrot.Thereupon I was given a pole to perch on instead of a nice warm bed tolie in and every day the queen's fowler used to come and whistle tunesfor me to learn. In the meantime however I improved my knowledge ofthe language and at last I spoke so well and intelligibly that all thecourtiers said that the learned doctors had been mistaken. One of thequeen's maids of honour not only thought that I was a man but fell in
comment155,love with me. She often used to steal to my cage and listen to mystories of the customs and amusements of our world. She was sointerested that she begged me to take her with me if ever I found a wayof returning to the Earth.In my examination by the learned doctors I had stated that their worldwas but a Moon and that the Moon from which I had come was really aworld. It was this which had made them angry against me. But my friendthe Man of the Sun at last prevailed upon the king to let me out of thecage on my retracting my wicked heresy. I was clad in splendid robesand placed on a magnificent chariot to which four great noblemen wereharnessed and led to the centre of the city where I had to make thefollowing statement"People I declare to you that this Moon is not a Moon but a world andthat the world I come from is not a world but a Moon. For this is whatthe Royal Council believe that you ought to believe."The Man of the Sun then helped me to descend from the chariot and tookme quickly into a house and stripped me of my gorgeous robes. "Why doyou do that" I asked. "This is the most splendid dress I have ever seenon the Moon.""It is a garb of shame" said my companion. "You have this day undergonethe lowest degradation that can be imposed on a man. You committed anawful crime in saying that the Moon was not a Moon. It is a great wonderyou were not condemned to die of old age.""Die of old age" I said."Yes" replied my companion. "Usually when a Man of the Moon comes tothat time of life in which he feels that he is losing his strength ofmind and body he invites all his friends to a banquet. After explainingwhat little hope he has of adding anything to the fine actions of hislife he asks for permission to depart. If he has led a bad life he isordered to live but if he has been a good man his dearest friendkisses him and plunges a dagger in his heart."As he was talking the son of the man in whose house we were stayingentered the room. My companion quickly rose on his four feet and madethe young man a profound bow. I asked him why he did this. He told methat on the Moon parents obey their children and old men are compelledto show to young men the greatest respect."They are of opinion" said my companion "that a strong and activeyoung man is more capable of governing a family than a dull infirmsexagenarian. I know that on your Earth old men are supposed to be wiseand prudent. But as a matter of fact their wisdom and prudenceconsists merely of a timid frame of mind and a disinclination to takeany risks."The father then entered the room and his son said to him in an angryvoice"Why have you not got our house ready to sail away You know the wallsof the city have gone some hours ago. Bring me at once your image"The man brought a great wooden image of himself and his son whipped itfuriously for a quarter of an hour."And now" said the young man at last "go and hoist the sails at once"_III.--Marvels of the Moon_There are two kinds of towns on the Moon travelling towns and sedentarytowns. In the travelling towns each house is built of very light woodand placed on a platform beneath the four corners of which great wheelsare fixed. When the time arrives for a voyage to the seaside or theforest for a change of air the townspeople hoist vast sails on theroofs of their dwellings and sail away altogether towards the new site.In the sedentary towns on the other hand the houses are made withgreat strong screws running from the cellars to the roofs which enablethem to be raised or lowered at discretion. The depth of the cellar isequal to the height of every house in winter the whole structure islowered below the surface of the ground in spring it is lifted upagain by means of the screw.As owing to the father's neglect the house in which we were stayingcould not set sail until the next day my companion and I accepted aninvitation to stay the night there. Our host then sent for a doctor who
comment156,prescribed what foods I should smell and what kind of bed I should liein."But I am not sick" I said to the Man of the Sun."If you were" he replied "the doctor would not have been sent for. Onthe Moon doctors are not paid to cure men but to keep them in goodhealth. They are officers of the state and once a day they call atevery house and instruct the inmates how to preserve their naturalvigour.""I wish" I. said "you could get him to order me a dozen roasted larksinstead of the mere smell of them. I should like to taste some solidfood just for a change."He spoke to the doctor and at a sign from him our host took a gun andled me into his garden."Are those the kind of birds you mean" he said pointing to a greatswarm of larks singing high up in the sky.I replied that they were and he shot at them and thirty larks tumbledover at our feet not merely dead but plucked seasoned and roasted."You see" said my host "we mix with our gunpowder and shot a certaincomposition which cooks as well as kills."I picked up one of the birds and ate it. In sober truth I have nevertasted on Earth anything so deliciously roasted.When I had finished my repast I was conducted to a little room thefloor of which was strewn with fine orange blossoms about three feetdeep. The Men of the Moon always sleep on these thick soft heaps offragrant flowers which are chosen for them every day by their doctors.Four servants came and undressed me and gently rubbed my limbs and mybody and in a few moments I was fast asleep.Early next morning I was awakened by the Man of the Sun who said to me"I know you are anxious to return to your Earth and relate the story ofall the strange and wonderful things you have seen on the Moon. If youcare to while away an hour or two over this book I will prepare foryour return voyage."The book which he put into my hand was an extraordinary object. It was akind of machine full of delicate springs and it looked like a new kindof clock. In order to read it you had to use not your eyes but yourears. For on touching one of the springs it began to speak like a man.It was a history of the Sun and I was still listening to it when mycompanion arrived."I am now ready" he said. "On what part of the Earth would you like toland""In Italy" I replied. "That will save me the cost and trouble oftravelling to Rome--a city I have always longed to see."Taking me in his arms the Man of the Sun rose swiftly up from the Moonand carried me across the intervening space and dropped me ratherroughly on a hill near Rome. When I turned to expostulate with him I
comment157,found that he had disappeared.                                   BJRNSTJERNE BJRNSONArne     Bjrnstjerne Bjrnson one of the greatest Scandinavian     writers was born at Kvikne in the wild region of the Dovre     Mountains Norway Dec. 8 1832. His father was the village     pastor. Six years later the family removed to Naesset on the     west coast of Norway. From the grammar school at Molde young     Bjrnson went to the University of Christiania and it was     then that he began to write verses and newspaper articles. At     Upsala in 1856 he understood that he had a definite call to     literature and at Copenhagen the following year he wrote his     first masterpiece "Synnove Solbakken." This was followed in     1858 by "Arne" a story which not only brought him into the     front rank of contemporary writers but also marked a new era     in Norwegian literature. From that time there has been a     succession of novels short stories and plays Bjrnson on     two occasions has been the director of a theatre from his     pen. A drama "The King" produced in 1877 had an after     effect of immense political importance. It was undoubtedly an     attack on the ruler of Norway and Sweden and every Norwegian     who wished his country to become an independent nation     welcomed Bjrnson as the leader of this new movement--with     what success there is now no need to relate since it has     become a matter of history. Bjrnson died April 25 1910._I.--The Little Song-Maker_It was up at Kampen that Arne was born. His mother was Margit the onlychild at the little farm among the crags. When she was eighteen shestopped too long at a dance one evening her friends had gone offwithout her so Margit thought the way home would be just as longwhether she waited till the end of the dance or not.Thus it came about that Margit remained sitting there till NilsSkrdder the fiddler suddenly laid aside his instrument as was hiswont when he had had more than enough to drink left the dancers to humtheir own tune took hold of the prettiest girl he could find andletting his feet keep as good time to the dance as music to a songjerked off with the heel of his boot the hat of the tallest man in theroom. "Ho" laughed he.As Margit walked home that night the moon was making wondrous sportover the snow. When she got to the loft where she slept she could nothelp looking out at it again.Next time there was a dance in the parish Margit was present. She didnot care much to dance that evening but sat listening to the music. Butwhen the playing ceased the fiddler rose and went straight across toMargit Kampen. She was scarcely aware of anything but that she wasdancing with Nils SkrdderBefore long the weather grew warmer and there was no more dancing thatspring.One Sunday when the summer was getting on Margit went to church withher mother. When they were at home again her mother threw both her armsaround her. "Hide nothing from me my child" she cried.Winter came again but Margit danced no more. Nils Skrdder went on
comment158,playing drank more than formerly and wound up each party by dancingwith the prettiest girl there. It was said for certain that he couldhave whichever he wished of the farmers' daughters and that Birgit thedaughter of Ben was sick for love of him.Just about this time a child of the cotter's daughter at Kampen wasbrought to be christened. It was given the name of Arne and its fatherwas said to be Nils Skrdder.The evening of that day saw Nils at a great wedding party. He would notplay but drank all he could and was dancing the whole time. But whenhe asked Birgit Ben for a dance she refused him. He turned and tookhold of the first good-looking girl near. She too held back andanswered a request he whispered in her ear with the words "The dancemight go further than I should like."At that Nils drew back and danced the "Halling" alone. Then he wentinto the barn laid himself down and wept.Margit sat at home with her little boy. She heard about Nils going fromdance to dance and it was not very long before Arne learnt that NilsSkrdder was his father and the kind of man he was.It was when Arne was about six years old that two Americans visitingthe place when a bridal party was going on were so much struck by theway Nils danced the "Halling" that they proposed to take him as theirservant at whatever wages he wanted. They would call for him on theirway back in about a week's time. Nils was the hero of the evening.The dance was resumed. Nils looked round at the girls and went over toBirgit Ben. He held out his hand and she put out hers. Then turningaway with a laugh he put his arm around the girl next to her anddanced off with boisterous glee.Birgit coloured and a tall quiet-looking man took her hand and dancedaway. Nils noticed it and presently danced so hard against them thatboth Birgit and her partner fell to the ground.The quiet-looking man got up went straight to Nils took him by thearm and knocked him down with a blow over the eyes. Nils fell heavilytried to rise and found that he couldn't--his back was badly hurt.Meantime at Kampen no sooner had the grandmother succeeded in payingoff the last instalment of debt on the farm than she was stricken withmortal sickness and died.A fortnight after the funeral six men brought in a litter and on thelitter lay Nils with his black hair and pale face.In the springtime a year after he had been brought to Kampen Nils andMargit were married. The fiddler's health was ruined but he was able tohelp in the fields and look after things. Then one Sunday afternoonwhen Nils and Arne were out together they saw a wedding processionfourteen carriages in all. Nils stood for a long time motionless afterthe bride and bridegroom had passed and for the rest of the day he wassullen and angry. He went out before supper and returned at midnightdrunk.From that day Nils was constantly going into town and coming home drunk.He reproached Margit for his wretched life he cursed her he struckher and beat her. Then would come fits of wild remorse.As Arne grew up Nils took him to dances and the boy learnt to sing allsorts of songs. His mother taught him to read and when he was fifteenhe longed to travel and to write songs.At home things got worse. As Nils grew feebler he became more drunkenand violent and often Arne would stay at home to amuse him in orderthat Margit might have an hour's peace. Arne began to loathe his fatherbut he kept this feeling to himself as he did his love for his mother.His one friend was Kristen the eldest son of a sea-captain. WithKristen Arne could talk of books and travel. But there came a day when
comment159,Kristen went away to be a sailor and Arne was left alone.Life was very heavy for him. He made up songs and put his grief intothem. But for his mother Arne would have left Kampen--he stood betweenher and Nils.One night about this time Nils came back late from a wedding-feast.Margit had gone to bed and Arne was reading. The boy helped his fatherupstairs and Nils began quoting texts from the Bible and cursing hisown downfall shedding drunken tears. Presently he made his way to thebed and put his fingers on Margit's throat.In vain the boy and his mother called on Nils to desist the drunkardtook no notice. Arne rushed to a corner of the room and picked up anaxe at the same moment Nils fell down and after a piercing shrieklay quite still.All that night they watched by the dead. A feeling of relief came uponthem both."He fell of himself" Arne said simply for at first his mother wasterrified by the sight of the axe."Remember Arne it's for your sake I've borne it all" Margit saidweeping. "You must never leave me.""Never never" he answered fervently._II.--The Call of the Mountains_Arne grew up reserved and shy he went on tending the cattle and makingsongs. He was now in his twentieth year. The pastor lent him books toread the only thing he cared for.Many a time he would have liked to read aloud to his mother but hecould not bring himself to do it. One of the songs he made at this timebegan    The parish is all restless but there's peace in grove and wood.    No beadle here impounds you to suit his crabbed mood    No strife profanes our little church tho' there it rages high    But then we have no little church and that perhaps is whyThe folks round about got to hear of his songs and would have been gladto talk to him but Arne was shy of people and disliked them chieflybecause he thought they disliked him.He gave up tending the cattle and stayed at home looking after thefarm. He was near his mother all day now and she would give him daintymeals. In his heart was a song with the refrain "Over the mountainshigh" Somehow Arne could never finish this song.There was a field labourer named Upland Knut at whose side Arne oftenworked. This man had neither parents nor friends and when Arne said tohim "Have you no one at all then to love you" he answered "Ah noI have no one."Arne thought of his own mother and his heart was full of love to her.What if he were to lose her because he had not sufficiently prized herhe thought and he rushed home to find his mother sleeping gently likea child.Mother and son were much together in those days and once they agreed togo to a wedding at a neighbouring farm.For the first time in his life Arne drank too much and all next day helay in the barn. He was full of self-reproach and it seemed to him thatcowardice was his besetting sin.Cowardice had been his failing as a boy. It had prevented him taking hismother's part against his father from leaving home from mixing withpeople. Cowardice had made him drunk and but for his fear andtimidity his verses would be better.After searching everywhere for him Margit eventually found him in thebarn. He tried to soothe her and vowed that he would join his life moreclosely to his mother's in future. What moved him was that his lovingpatient mother said that she had done a grievous wrong against him andimplored his forgiveness."Of course I forgive you" he said."God bless you my dear dear Arne."From that day Arne was not only happier at home but he began to lookat other people more kindly more with his mother's gentle eyes. But hestill went about alone and a strange longing often possessed his soul.One summer evening Arne had gone out to sit by the Black Lake a pieceof water very dark and deep. He sat behind some bushes and looked outover the water and at the hills opposite and at the homesteads in thevalley.
comment160,Presently he heard voices close beside him. A young girl he made outwas grumbling because she had got to leave the parsonage where she hadbeen staying with Mathilde the parson's daughter and it was her fatherwho was taking her home. A third voice sharp and strident was heard."Hurry up now Baard push off the boat or we sha'n't be hometo-night."The rattle of cart-wheels followed and Baard fetched a box out of thecart and carried it down to the boat.Then Mathilde the parson's daughter came running up calling "EliEli"The two girls wept in each other's arms."You must take this" said Mathilde giving her friend a bird-cage."Mother wants you to. Yes you must take Narrifas and then you'll oftenthink of me.""Eli Come come Eli" came the summons from the boat.A moment after and Arne saw the boat out in the water Eli standing upin the stern holding the bird-cage and waving her hand to Mathilde. Hiseyes followed the boat and he watched it draw near to the land. Hecould see the three forms mirrored in the water and continued gazinguntil they had left the boat and gone indoors at the biggest house onthe opposite side of the lake.Mathilde had sat for some time by the landing stage but she had leftnow and Arne was alone when Eli came out again for a last look acrossthe water. Arne could see her image in the lake. "Perhaps she sees menow" he thought. Then when the sun had set he got up and went homefeeling that all things were at peace.Arne's fancies for some time now were of dreams of love and fairmaidens. Old ballads and romances mirrored them for him as the waterhad mirrored the young girl.A two-fold longing--the yearning to have someone to love and a desireto do something great--sprang up together in his soul and melted intoone. Again he began to work at the song "Over the mountains high"altering it and thinking each time "One day it will carry me off." Buthe never forgot his mother in his thoughts of travel and decided thathe would send for her as soon as he had got a footing abroad.There was in the parish a merry old fellow of the name of Ejnar Aasen.He was well off and in spite of a lameness that made him use a crutchwas fond of organising parties of children to go nutting. All the young
comment161,people called him "godfather."Aasen liked Arne and invited him to join in the next nutting party andthough Arne blushed and made excuses he decided to go. He foundhimself the only young man among many girls. They were not the maidensof whom he had made songs nor yet was he afraid of them. They were morefull of life than anything he had seen and they could make merry overanything. All of them laughed at Arne as they caught at the branchesbecause he was serious so that he could not help laughing himself.After a while they all sat on a large knoll old Aasen in the middleand told stories. And then they were anxious to tell their dreams butthis could be done only to one person and Arne was trusted to hear thedreams. The last of the girls to tell her dreams was called Eli and shewas the girl he had seen in the boat.Arne had to say which was the best dream and as he said he wanted timeto think they left him sitting on the knoll and trooped off withgodfather. Arne sat for some time and the old yearnings to travel cameback and drove him to his song "Over the mountains high." Now atlast he had got the words and taking paper out of his pocket he wrotethe song through to the end. When he had finished he rose and left thepaper on the knoll and later when he found he had forgotten it hewent back. But the paper was gone.One of the girls who had returned to seek him had found--not Arne buthis song._III.--Love's Awakening_Whenever Arne mentioned his friend Kristen and wondered why he neverheard from him his mother left the room and seemed unhappy for daysafterwards. He noticed too that she would get specially nice meals forhim at such times.He had never been so gentle since his father's death as he was thatwinter. On Sundays he would read a sermon to his mother and go tochurch with her but she knew this was only to win her consent to hisgoing abroad in the spring. Upland Knut who had always been alone nowcame to live at Kampen. Arne had become very skilful with axe and sawand that winter he was often busy at the parsonage as well as Kampen.One day a messenger came from Ben to ask him if he would go over there
comment162,for some carpentry work. He answered "Yes" without thinking about thematter. As soon as the man had gone his mother told him that it wasBaard Ben who had injured his father but Arne decided to go all thesame.It was a fine homestead and Baard and Arne soon became on friendlyterms. He had many talks too with Eli and at times would sing his ownsongs to her and afterwards feel ashamed.Then Eli fell ill and Birgit blamed Baard because Mathilde had goneaway from the parsonage on a visit to town without bidding good-bye toEli. It seemed to Baard that whatever he did was wrong."You either keep silent too much or you talk too much" said his wife.During Eli's illness Baard would often sit and talk with Arne and oneday he told him how he had been driven to attack Nils and then how hehad courted and won Birgit."She was very melancholy at first" said Baard "and I had nothing tosay and then she got into bustling domineering ways and I had nothingto say to that. But one day of real happiness I've not had the twentyyears we've been married."When Eli was getting better her mother came down one evening and askedArne in her daughter's name to go up and sing to her. Eli had heardhim singing. Arne was confused but gave in and went upstairs.The room was in darkness and he had not seen Eli since the day she hadfallen ill and he had helped to carry her to her room. Arne sat down ina chair at the foot of the bed. When people talk in the dark they aregenerally more truthful than when they see one another's faces.Eli made Arne sing to her first a hymn and then a song of his own. Forsome time there was silence between them and then Eli said "I wonderArne that you who have so much that is beautiful within should wantto go away. You must not go away.""There are times when I seem not to want to so much" he answered.Presently Arne could hear her weeping and he felt that he mustmove--either forward or back."Eli""Yes." Both voices were at a whisper."Give me your hand."She made no answer. He listened quickly closely stretched out his ownhand and grasped a warm little hand that lay bare.There was a step on the stairs they let go of one another and Birgitentered with a light. "You've been sitting too long in the dark" shesaid putting the candle on the table. But neither Eli nor Arne couldbear the light she turned to the pillow and he shaded his face withhis hands."Ah yes it's a bit dazzling at first" said the mother "but thefeeling soon passes away."Next day Arne heard that Eli was better and going to come down for atime after dinner. He at once put his tools together and bade farewellto the farm. And when Eli came downstairs he was gone._IV.--After Many Years_It was springtime when Margit went up to the parsonage. There wassomething heavy on her heart. Letters had come from Kristen for Arneand she had been afraid to give them to her son lest he should go awayand join his friend. Kristen had even sent money and this Margit hadgiven to Arne pretending it had been left him by his grandmother. Allthis Margit poured out to the old pastor and also her fears that Arnewould go travelling."Ah" he said smiling "if only there was some little lassie who couldget hold of him. Eli Ben eh And if he could manage so that they couldmeet sometimes at the parsonage."Margit looked up anxiously."Well we'll see what we can do" he went on "for to tell you thetruth my wife and daughter have long been of the same mind."Then came the summer and one day when the heavens were clear Arnewalked out and threw himself down on the grass. He meant to go to theparsonage and borrow a newspaper. He had not been to Ben since thatnight in the sick-room and now he glanced towards the house and thenturned away his eyes. Presently he heard someone singing his song thesong he had lost the very day he made it.    Fain would I know what the world may be        Over the mountains high.    Mine eyes can nought but the white snow see    And up the steep sides the dark fir-tree        That climbs as if yearning to know.
comment163,        Say tree dost thou venture to goThere were eight verses and Arne stood listening till the last word haddied away. He must see who it was and presently above him he caughtsight of Eli.The sunlight was falling straight on her and it seemed to Arne as helooked at her that he had never seen or dreamt of anything morebeautiful in his life. He watched her get up without letting himself beseen and presently she was gone. Arne no longer wanted to go to theparsonage but he went and sat where she had sat and his breast wasfull of gentle feelings.Eli often went to the parsonage and one Sunday evening Margit found herthere and persuaded the girl to walk back to Kampen with her. Elientered the house only when she heard that Arne was not at home. It wasthe first time she had visited the homestead. Margit took her all overthe house and showed her Arne's room and opened a little chest full ofsilk kerchiefs and ribbons."He bought something each time he's been to the town" Margit remarked.Eli would have given anything to go away but she dared not speak.In a special compartment in the chest she had seen a buckle a pair ofgold rings and a hymn-book bound with silver clasps and wrought on theclasps was"Eli Baardsdatter Ben."The mother put back the things closed the box and clasped the girl toher heart for Eli was weeping.When they were downstairs again they heard a man's step in the passageand Arne entered and saw Eli."You here" he said and blushed a fiery red. Then he put his armsaround her and she leant her head on his breast. He whispered somethingin her ear and for a long while they stood in silence her arms aroundhis neck.As they walked home together in the fair summer evening they couldutter but few words in their strange new Happiness. Nature interpretedtheir hearts to one another and on his way back from that firstsummer-night's walk Arne made many new songs.It was harvest time when the marriage of Eli with Arne was celebrated.The Black Water was full of boats taking people to Ben.All the doors were open at the house. Eli was in her room with Mathildeand the pastor's wife. Arne was downstairs looking out from the window.Presently Baard and Birgit both dressed for church met on the stairsand went up together to a garret where they were alone. Baard hadsomething to say but it was hard to say it."Birgit" he began "you've been thinking as I've been I daresay. _He_stood between us two I know and it's gone on a long time. To-day a sonof his has come into our house and to him we've given our onlydaughter.... Birgit can't we too join our hearts to-day"His voice trembled but no answer came.They heard Eli outside calling gently "Aren't you coming mother"
comment164,"Yes I'm coming now dear" said Birgit in a choking voice. She walkedacross the room to Baard took his hand in hers and broke into violentsobs. The two hands clung tight and it was hand in hand they opened thedoor and went downstairs. And when the bridal train streamed down to thelanding stage and Arne gave his hand to Eli Baard against all customtook Birgit's hand in his own and followed them calmly happilysmilingly.In the boat his eyes rested on the bridal pair and on his wife. "Ah" hesaid to himself "no one would have thought such a thing possible twentyyears ago."                                   In God's Way     "In God's Way" belongs to the second group of Bjrnson's     novels of which the first group is represented by early     peasant tales like "Arne." In this later category the stories     are of a more or less didactic nature. Although "In God's Way"     lacks something of the freshness and beauty that distinguished     "Arne" it is nevertheless a powerful and vivid picture of     Norwegian religious life and it is of all Bjrnson's books     the one by which he is most widely known outside his native     country. In this story Bjrnson has been influenced by the     social dramas of his compatriot Ibsen but it may be     questioned whether he has not brought to his task a higher     inspiration and a stronger faith in humanity than the famous     dramatist possessed. Published in 1889 the main theme of "In     God's Way" was undoubtedly suggested by the religious     excitement which then prevailed in Norway._I.--A Strange Home-coming_Pastor Tuft was walking up and down his study composing his Sundaysermon. He was a handsome man with a long fair face and dreamy eyeshis wife Josephine in the days when she thought she was in love withhim used to call him Melanchthon--that was not many years ago and hestill resembled in appearance the poet of the Reformation. But hisfeatures had now lost their fine serenity and he was glad when hisbitter and troubled thoughts on the doctrine of justification--a subjecthe had chosen for its bearing on his brother-in-law's conduct--wereinterrupted by his wife. Josephine burst into his study in a state offierce excitement."They will be here in a moment" she said. "The steamer has arrived. Ohthat woman that woman She has ruined my brother's life""If he wanted to settle again in Norway with her" said the pastor"couldn't he have chosen some spot where the story of their misconductwas not known But to come to the very town Everybody will remember""Yes" said Josephine "it is only six years since Edward ran off toAmerica with Sren Kule's wife. Surely he will not expect you aminister to receive the woman especially as Kule is still living."
comment165,While she was talking Tuft stared out of the window. A tall man inlight clothes was coming to the house--a tall man with a clear-cutsunburnt face and a lean curved nose that gave him the air of a birdof prey. By his side was a lady with sweet delicate features dressedin a tartan travelling costume. There was a knock at the door. Josephinewent down very slowly and opened it. "Edward"There was a glow in her eyes as she welcomed her brother and his eyesalso lighted up. He was about to cross the threshold when he noticedthat she completely disregarded his companion. In the meantime Tuft hadcome to the door he too made no advances. There was always somethingof the keen wild look of an eagle about Edward Kallem it became stillmore striking as he glared at his sister and brother-in-law."Are you waiting" he said "for me to introduce my wife Well here sheis--Ragni Kallem."So the pair had married in America If Tuft and Josephine had not beenso eager to impute every sort of misconduct to runaways they would haveforeseen this natural event. Tuft tried to find something to say butfailed and glanced at Josephine. But she did not look as if she werewilling to help him.For the fact that Edward and Ragni were now married increased ratherthan diminished Josephine's bitterness. Although she would not admit itto herself her religious objections were a mere pretence. She wasjealous jealous with the strange jealousy of a sister who wanted to beall in all to her brilliant brother and hated that another woman shouldbe more to him than she was. All her life had been centred on him. Shehad married Ole Tuft a poor peasant's son because he was the bosomfriend of Edward. Her marriage she thought would connect them stillmore closely. She wanted to live by his side watching him rise intofame as the greatest doctor in Norway. For young Kallem's masters hadpredicted that he would prove to be a man of genius.Possessing considerable wealth he had taken up the study of medicinenot as a means of livelihood but as a matter of love and duty. Thensix years ago he had run off with old Sren Kule's young wife andJosephine's dream had come to an end leaving her life little more thana dull empty round of routine housework.This was why she now gazed with hard cold eyes at Ragni. Edward Kallemsaw her look of wild hatred and taking his weeping wife gently by thearm he turned away and led her from the house into the road.Josephine went upstairs and gazed from the study window at theretreating figures. Her husband followed her with a curious look in hiseyes. Neither of them spoke. In their hearts was raging a storm ofpassion wilder than the anger which possessed Kallem and the sorrowwhich bowed down Ragni.
comment166,Josephine left the room without looking-at her husband. He gazed afterher still with the same curious look in his eyes. Then pulling himselftogether he went on writing his sermon. "What makes God so merciful tosinners" he wrote. "His infinite love Yes justification is certainlyan act of mercy but it is also an act of judgment. The claims of thelaw must be first fulfilled. A sinner must believe in order to besaved."The point in this was that Edward Kallem was a freethinker. There couldbe no forgiveness for him. At the bottom of his heart Tuft was gladthat there had been no reconciliation. Ever since he had married thewealthy and beautiful sister of his bosom friend he had been jealous ofJosephine's passionate attachment to her brother. Her brother hadremained her hero and the peasant she had married and enriched waslittle more than her servant.While with these bitter thoughts in his head Tuft was composing hissermon Josephine was writing a dastardly letter. It was to Sren Kule.Edward and Ragni had returned married. There was an empty house nearthe one they had bought. Would Sren Kule come and live in it So theletter ran. The next day Sunday Josephine went to church in a veryChristianlike frame of mind. She felt she had done her duty and avengedherself in doing it._II.--The Poison of Tongues_At first things did not go as Josephine expected. With the exception ofhis sister and brother-in-law everybody welcomed Edward Kallem and hiswife back to his native town. At the house of Pastor Meek the oldestand most influential of the clergy Ragni was introduced to a middle-aged lady who startled her by saying"I am Sren Kule's sister. I want to tell you that in your position Ishould have acted just as you did."This indeed was the general verdict. No one who knew Sren Kule blamedRagni. An old rake blind and half-paralysed as the immediate result ofill-living he had worried his first wife Ragni's sister into thegrave and then taken advantage of the young girl's innocence to marryher. The man was a mass of corruption and his second marriage was oneof those strangely cruel crimes which go unpunished in the present stateof society. Kallem who was then lodging in the same house as Kule wasmaddened by it. Being a doctor he foresaw clearly the fate of the purelovely girlish victim of Kule's brutal passion and in rescuing herfrom it he had displayed in the opinion of his friends the chivalry ofsoul of a modern knight-errant.Pastor Meek was a liberal-minded and courageous old man he showed hissympathy with the Kallems and his trust in them in a practical manner."My grandson Karl" he said to Kallem "is at school here. I wish youwould let him come now and then to your house. He is only nineteenyears old but he promises to be a first-rate composer. Your wife playsthe piano beautifully. They ought to get on well together."Kallem was so pleased with this mark of approval that he went the nextmorning to the young musician's lodgings and invited him to come andlive with him. Karl Meek was a lanky awkward hobbledehoy with atousled head of hair and long red hands which were always covered withchilblains. Ragni asked him to play a simple duet but he made so manymistakes in playing that she got up from the piano. He was upset andran away from the house. Kallem spent an afternoon looking for him andbrought him back with his hair cut his nails trimmed and his clothesbrushed."Can't you see" said Kallem to his wife. "The lad's shy and afraid ofyou. Do my dear make him feel quite at home."Ragni was a sweet and gentle woman and though she did not like Karl
comment167,much at first she took him in hand and little by little obtained agreat influence over the wild creature. As his fine poetic naturegradually revealed itself she began to mother him. They were often seenwalking out together and as soon as the snow was firm they used to goand meet Kallem and drive home with him each standing on one of therunners of his sledge. One afternoon after they had been skatingtogether on the frozen bay they were returning without Kallem when acarriage barred their way. At the sound of Ragni's voice the man insidesaid"There she goes Who is it with her Another man Ah I thought that'swhat would happen"Ragni shuddered. It was Sren Kule. The paralysed old rake turned hisblind face upon her as though he could see her and had caught herdoing wrong. The carriage stopped by the next house to the Kallems.Before Kule could get out Ragni had run indoors. Shortly afterwards herhusband arrived. She saw that he too had met Kule and he saw that shehad gone into the bedroom to hide herself. She buried her head in hisarms it seemed to her that the air was now full of evil spirits.And so it was. Edward Kallem did not know it as he was now too busy togo out anywhere. He was spending a great deal of his wealth in fittingout a private hospital for the study and treatment of the diseases thathe specialised in. But Karl Meek soon became aware of malign influencesworking around him and around the two persons for whom he wouldwillingly nay happily have laid down his life. He met an old friendin the street who said to him"How do you stand in regard to Mrs. Kallem"Karl did not take in his meaning and began to praise Ragnienthusiastically."Yes I know all about that" his friend interrupted. "But to make aclean breast of it are you her lover""How dare you how dare you" cried Karl.His friend quietly said that he only wanted to warn Karl the report hadcertainly got about."You've been a great deal together you know" said his friend "thathas given the scandal-mongers something to go on."Both Edward and Ragni saw that something had happened to Karl when hereturned. He was in a black mood he did not speak his blue eyes wereby turns strangely savage and strangely sorrowful. He had to go home atonce he said. He could not tell them now what the matter was but hewould write to them as soon as he could pluck up the courage to do so.He packed his luggage and Kallem went to see him off.A few days afterwards Ragni received a letter from Karl. He was goingto Berlin he said to take up the study of music seriously. And thenfor four pages he talked about his prospects. But there was anotherpage a loose one on which was written in red ink "Read this when you
comment168,are alone.""I have decided Ragni" Karl wrote "that it would be wisest to tellyou why I left so suddenly. Someone has started a dreadful slanderagainst us. If I do not now tell you you will hear it from the lips ofsome enemy. Ah God that I should have brought this upon you Love youOf course I love you. How could I help doing so after all your kindnessto me And as for Edward I worship the ground he treads on. He is thenoblest man I have ever met. But do not show him this letter. Spare himthe evil news as long as possible. Now that I have gone away it may allblow over."Kallem did not get home from the hospital that night until eighto'clock. When he came home his wife was lying in bed with a headache.She did not get up the next morning. She was in bed several days. Whenat last she got up her husband noticed that she had grown very thinher face had a tired delicate expression there were dark rings aroundher sweet eyes and she was troubled with a cough._III.--The Fell Work of Slander_Ragni now did not stir outside her own door. She longed for fresh airbut she would not go out into the town for fear of the cruel curiouseyes of the scandal-mongers. Sren Kule haunted her. His houseoverlooked her garden and she got the strange fancy into her head thathe was always sitting at the window blindly listening for her. So shenever even went for a walk in the park-like grounds which Kallem hadpurchased wholly for her pleasure.The poison of scandal had done its work. Her husband unfortunatelynever suspected that she was really ill he had a deep longing for achild of his marriage and misled by too eager a hope hemisinterpreted the strange alteration in his wife's health.But one evening when she coughed some blood came up. Kallem saw itand the hideous truth came upon him in a blinding flash. It was theterrible disease which he had spent the greater part of his fortune infighting against. Tuberculosis But how was it that it had come sosuddenly and ravaged her dear sweet tender body so furiously She wasin a galloping consumption and the end was not far off ... a fewweeks ... a few days perhaps."Darling" he said coming to her bedside one day "isn't there somesecret you would like to confide in me--some secret that has beenhurting and distressing you Tell me dearest for I shall have no peaceuntil I know it.""I will tell you" she said. "I have just been thinking about it. Youwill find some papers in my writing-table--they are all for you. Readthem dear when----" she broke off abruptly--"by and by. You willunderstand that it was for your sake I kept it secret."He went downstairs and in the writing-table he found Karl's letter.Horror indignation and helplessness overcame him. Why had he not knownof this in time He would have gone to every soul in the town and toldthem that they lied."Ay" he said "I will tell them so yet. They have murderedher--cowardly murdered her Ah God I have spent my life and my fortunein my endeavours to benefit them and there's not one of them--notone--honest enough to tell me to defend my wife's good name"What drove him almost to madness was that there was none he could go toand take by the throat exclaiming "You have done this You areanswerable to me for this" Still there was one who stood apart fromthe others--Josephine. Josephine had not invented the slander that wasnot her way. But she would believe what was invented when it concernedanyone she disliked. And how she disliked Ragni Yes it was Josephineand her hypocrite of a husband who had laid his darling open to thissort of attack. Very well Everything else was gone--his joy of lifehis interest in science and his love of mankind. But he still hadsomething to live for--vengeanceAs he was sitting one evening by the bedside of his wife the dooropened and Karl Meek came into the room. "Is she dead" said the boy.Ragni heard the question. She looked up and tried to smile. Her eyesrested for a moment on Karl and then remained on her husband. A moment
comment169,after she was dead.Josephine was surprised to hear that Karl Meek was the only person whomher brother allowed to follow the coffin of his dead wife. Did that meanthat Edward did not suspect him Or more likely that he had forgivenhim Ah if one could be as good as that"God's way with sinners" said Tuft "may seem cruel but it is reallykind and merciful. The death of that woman will work for Edward's goodOf course he feels it keenly now but he will get over it. It is ablessing in disguise."As soon as Tuft uttered these words he felt the sheer brutality of them.By a strange irony of fate his own child had fallen ill about the timethat Ragni took to her bed and the minister and his wife were nowtalking over the couch of their suffering little boy. Something waswrong with his chest and Josephine would have liked to call in herclever brother in place of the ordinary family doctor but she would nothumble herself to beg his help. Perhaps it was the shock of herhusband's words that aroused her but that night the springs of hernature were strangely opened. She came downstairs in her nightdress toTuft's bed and awoke him. Her eyes were fixed in a blank stare."I can't sleep Ole" she whispered. "I want to warn you. That woman--Edward's wife--is trying to take away our boy. We have been too hard onher--too hard. Now she will make us pay for it.""You are not yourself Josephine" said Tuft rising up and dressinghimself hastily. "I will fetch the doctor.""No no" she cried. "Ask Edward to come."Tuft did not dare do this himself but he got his doctor to approachKallem who made an appointment to examine the child early next morning.Josephine shrieked when she saw him. Under the stress of mentalsuffering the flesh on his face had wasted to the bone he was theimage of death. Without speaking to either of the parents he went to thechild tapped its chest lightly here and there and then said somethingto the doctor and went out."He has gone to get his instruments" the doctor whispered. "The case isextremely serious. An operation must be performed at once."Josephine did not speak neither did Tuft. They had been watchingKallem's face as he bent over their boy and in it they seemed to readthe sentence of death. They had called him in too late.They were mistaken. Edward Kallem came hurrying back with a staff oftrained assistants. Tuft and Josephine were locked outside their child'sroom. An hour afterwards the door was opened. The boy's life was saved.This they learnt from their own doctor but Kallem himself departedwithout even speaking to them._IV.--The Reconciliation_That night over the body of the sleeping child Ole Tuft at last dealtsternly and truly with himself. Three times in the course of the dayhad he gone to Kallem's house to thank him for saving his boy's life.
comment170,But Kallem had refused to see him. At the third refusal Tuft understood.If ever he entered his brother-in-law's house he would enter it achanged man. He was now vowing that he would begin this new life byuniting Edward and Josephine. It was his jealousy he admitted tohimself which had been the root of all the mischief.Edward had been his hero too in his younger days and it was thiscommon worship of a nobler and more gifted nature which had brought himand Josephine together. Why had he not let it remain the base of theirintercourse Their marriage would then have been a happy one and hisown life would have been filled with larger thoughts and more generousfeelings.While Pastor Tuft was meditating his wife was acting. She too had beenrefused admittance to her brother's house. So she was writing to him.For whatever wrong they might have done she said they wished to makeamends. They had been intolerant she allowed and they were sorry forit. But surely they were worthy to be accused Would he not then tellthem plainly what they had done to make him so angrySome days afterwards Josephine received a large envelope addressed toher by her brother. But she was surprised on opening it to find thatit was full of papers in two strange handwritings. They were letters toKallem from Ragni and Karl Meek. Josephine trembled as she looked atthem. She began by chance with Meek's letters. Ragni innocent Good Godwas she innocent Yes Now she understood why Edward had driven away onthe day of the funeral with only Karl Meek by his side but she couldnot understand how he had survived it.The servant knocked at her bedroom door saying that supper was ready."No no" she managed to exclaim as she writhed in shame and sorrow.She must go at once to her brother if she had to go to him on her knees.But no Here were Ragni's letters. She felt as if her brother werestanding over her and forcing her to read them. Some of them were earlylove-letters. There had been no misconduct. Her chivalrous brother andthe sweet gentle woman whom he had rescued from a horrible fate hadlived apart from one another in America until the day of their marriage.Josephine slipped from the chair down upon her knees weeping andsobbing. "Forgive me Forgive me" she whispered pressing Ragni'sletters in her hands.Then she forced herself to silence so that no one might discover hercrouching there in the shame of her crime. She had murdered herbrother's wife--not by words but by her silence Yes she was amurderess Well let Edward deal with her as he thought fitShe ran wildly out of the house into the dark rainy street past herhusband's church past the white wall of Sren Kule's dwelling. Herbrother was standing in the open door surrounded by trunks and boxes.
comment171,Was he thinking of going away Tears streamed down her face."Edward"She could get no further. He drew himself upright his face white andstern."You shall never enter here" he said with a break in his voice.He bent down to do up a trunk. When he got up she was gone. With afierce look in his eyes he continued his preparations. He meant tocatch the first train the next morning and get at once far away fromhis native town. What he would then do he did not know except that hewould never return. When everything was ready he locked the front doorand went to bed. But he could not sleep. Twice in the night thedoor-bell rang but he would not open the door. It rang a third timeand kept on ringing and at last he got out of bed. It was Ole Tuft. Hisface was ghastly."Where is my wife Edward Kallem What have you done with my wife" hemoaned."Ragni's grave" said Kallem. "She is there I think."And then he slammed the door to. Just as dawn was breaking the bellrang again. Kallem went into the hall and saw that two pieces of paperhad been thrust through the letter-box. On one Tuft had written "Sheis not there Edward she was not there. I found this note on mywriting-table among the letters you sent her. Oh Edward it was notlike you to send her away" On the other piece of paper Josephine hadwritten "Read these Ole and you will understand all. For my life'ssake I am now going to my brother""For my life's sake" Kallem shivered as he read it and all his oldlove for his sister came back to him. Had he killed her She had wrongedRagni true but it was merely out of jealousy. Jealousy because he hadmade Ragni all in all to him and left her out of his life. He couldhave brought his wife and sister together but he had not tried to doit. Ah he too was guilty All her life long Josephine had looked upto him and worshipped him. Then he had come back from America and casther off for one who was not worthy of him so it seemed to her. And inhis fierce pride he had refused to reveal to her the fine character ofhis wife.He rushed out of the door resolved to find what had become of her. Shewas sitting on the steps of the house. As she saw him she crouched down
comment172,like a wounded bird which cannot get away yet must not be seen. Hetook her up into his arms and carried her indoors."Let me stay Edward--let me stay" she said.He bent over her and kissed her."God's ways God's ways" said Ole Tuft as he and Edward and Josephinewalked slowly towards his house through the empty streets in the earlymorning."But I still cannot share your faith" Kallem said."It matters not" said the minister. "There where good people walk areGod's ways."                                   WILLIAM BLACKA Daughter of Heth     William Black born in Glasgow Scotland Nov. 13 1841 was     educated with a view to being a landscape painter a training     that clearly influenced his literary life. He became a painter     of scenery in words. At the age of twenty-three he went to     London after some experience in Glasgow journalism and     joined the staff of the "Morning Star" and later the "Daily     News" of which journal he became assistant-editor. His first     novel appeared in 1868 but it was not until the publication     of "A Daughter of Heth" in 1871 that Black secured the     attention of the reading public. "The Strange Adventures of a     Phaeton" followed and in 1873 "A Princess of Thule" attained     great popularity. Retiring from journalism the next year he     devoted himself entirely to fiction. A score of novels     followed the last in 1898 just before his death on December     10 of that year. No novelist has lavished more tender care on     the portrayal of his heroines or worked up more delicately a     scenic background for plaintive sentiment._I.--In Strange Surroundings_"Noo Wattie" said the Whaup "ye maun say a sweer before ye get up.I'm no jokin' and unless ye be quick ye'll be in the water."Wattie Cassilis the "best boy" of the Airlie Manse paragon ofscholars and exemplar to his four brothers was depending from a smallbridge over the burn his head downward and a short distance from thewater his feet being held close to the parapet by the muscular arms ofhis eldest brother Tammas Cassilis commonly known as the Whaup."Wattie" repeated the Whaup "say a sweer or into the burn ye'll gangas sure as daith" and he dipped Wattie a few inches so that theripples touched his head. Wattie set up a fearful howl."Now will ye say it""_Deevil_" cried Wattie. "Let me up I hae said a sweer"The other brothers raised a demoniac shout of triumph over his apostacy."Ye maun say a worse sweer Wattie. Deevil is no bad enough.""I'll droon first" whimpered Wattie "and then ye'll get your paiksI'm thinking."Down went Wattie's head into the burn again and this time he was raisedwith his mouth sputtering out the contents it had received."I'll say what ye like _D--n_ is that bad enough"With another unholy shout of derision Wattie was raised and set on thebridge."Noo" said the Whaup standing over him "let me tell you this my man.The next time ye gang to my faither and tell a story about any one o'us or the next time you say a word against the French lassie as ye ca'her do ye ken what I'll do I'll take ye back to my faither by the lug
comment173,and I'll tell him ye were sweerin' like a trooper down by the burn andevery one o' us will testify against you and then I'm thinking itwill be your turn to consider paiks."Catherine Cassilis "the French lassie" had arrived at the Manse a fewweeks before and she had sore need of a champion.Andrew Bogue the ancient henchman of the Rev. Gavin Cassilis ministerof Airlie who met her at the station disapproved of her from the firstas a foreign jade dressed so that all the men turned and looked at heras if she had been a snare of Satan. Then had not young Lord Earlshopeafter introducing himself taken a seat in the trap and talked with herin her own language as if he had known her for years"They jabbered away in their foreign lingo" said Andrew that evening tohis wife Leezibeth the housekeeper "and I'm thinking it was siccan alanguage was talked in Sodom and Gomorrah. And he was a' smiles and shewas a' smiles and they seemed to think nae shame o' themselves goin'through a decent countryside"The Whaup himself had said on the night of Coquette's arrival "Ohshe's an actress and I hate actresses" But before many days hadpassed he completely changed that hasty view. The big sturdylong-legged lad succumbed to the charms of his parentless cousin--thedaughter of the minister's brother who had settled in France and takento himself a French wife--and he became her defender against thoseinhabitants of the Manse and the parish--from his brother Wattie to thepragmatic schoolmaster--whose prejudices she unintentionally outraged.Even the minister was grieved when Coquette as her father had calledher made a casual remark about the "last time she had gone to themass.""I am deeply pained" said the minister gravely. "I knew not that mybrother had been a pervert from the communion of our church.""Papa was not a Catholic" said Coquette. "Mamma and I were. But itmatters nothing. I will go to your church--it is the same to me. I onlytry to be kind to the people around me--that is all.""She has got the best part of all religions if she does her best for thepeople about her" said the Whaup."Thomas" remonstrated the minister severely "you are not competent tojudge of these things."Coquette's second error was to play the piano on a Sabbath morning. Shewas stopped in this hideous offence by the housekeeper Leezibeth."Is the Manse to be turned topsalteery and made a byword a' because o'a foreign hussy" asked Leezibeth."Look here" said the Whaup trying to comfort his weeping cousin "youcan depend on me. When you get into trouble send for me and if any manor woman in Airlie says a word to you by jingo I'll punch their head"The discovery of a crucifix over the head of the maiden's bed filledfull the cup of Leezibeth's wrath and indignation."I thought the Cross was a symbol of all religions" said Coquettehumbly. "If it annoys you I will take it down. My mother gave it tome--I cannot put it away altogether.""You shall not part with it" said the Whaup. "Let me see the man orwoman who will touch that crucifix though it had on it the woman o'Babylon herself"But the Whaup himself was troubled by the acquaintance of Coquette with
comment174,Lord Earlshope which from a casual meeting developed with startlingrapidity.His lordship's reputation in the parish was far from good. He neverattended the kirk was seen walking about with his dogs and smoking onthe Sabbath and even it was said read novels on that holy day. Hisappearance in church on the first Sunday after Coquette's arrival inAirlie was not difficult to explain and it was followed by interchangesof visits between the Manse and Earlshope House.Soon the young lord and Coquette began to meet when she was taking herearly walk a form of "carrying on" which outraged the sentiments of theparish and caused the Whaup to announce his intention of "giving herup" and going to sea.The alienation of the Whaup made Coquette very miserable and when heruncle discovered her walking alone with Lord Earlshope she tearfullyrequested to be allowed to go back to France."I am suspected" she sobbed in her foreign English "I do hear theytalk of me as dangerous. Is it wrong for me to speak to Lord Earlshopewhen I do see him kind to me Since I left France I did meet no one socourteous as he has been. He does not think me wicked because I have acrucifix my mother gave me and he does not suspect me."Her second conquest--for the Whaup on seeing her dejection hadrelented and returned to his allegiance--was Leezibeth and it was bymusic she was won. Coquette was playing and singing "The Flowers o' theForest" when Leezibeth crept in and said shamefacedly"Will ye sing that again miss Maybe ye'll no ken that me and Andrewhad a boy--a bit laddie that dee'd when he was but seven years auld--andhe used to sing the 'Flowers o' the Forest' afore a' the ither songsand ye sing it that fine it makes a body amaist like to greet."And from that day Leezibeth was the slave of Coquette but for the mostpart the thoughts of her neighbours were no kinder to the gay andspontaneous "daughter of Heth" from the sunny South than were the greyand dreary skies of Scotland._II.--The Lovers of Coquette_When Sir Peter and Lady Drum returned to Castle Cawmil their home inthe neighbourhood of Airlie Lady Drum whose joy it was to doctor herfriends prescribed at once a cruise for the drooping Coquette. And LordEarlshope lent his yacht and accompanied the party as a visitor. Theminister looking back anxiously at his parish Coquette and the Whaupjoined the party from the Manse.On Coquette the cruise worked wonders. She recovered her spirits andher cheeks flushed with happiness."You're a pretty invalid" said the Whaup to Coquette as they wentashore for a scramble. "Give me your hand if you want climbing and I'llgive you enough of it.""No" said Coquette "I will not be pulled by a big rough boy but whenyou are gentle like Lord Earlshope I like you." Then lest Tom shouldbe hurt she added "You are a very good boy Tom and somebody will getvery fond of you some day."From that moment the Whaup grew more serious and ceased his boyishtricks."I think your cousin is very fond of you" said the good-natured LadyDrum to Coquette. "Don't you think that some day or other he will askyou to marry him""It may be" replied Coquette dubiously. "I do not know because my
comment175,uncle has not spoken to me of any such thing but he may think it a goodmarriage and arrange it." A French view of marriage that greatlyastonished Lady Drum.The new sense of responsibility that had come to the Whaup determinedhim to return at once to Glasgow and resume his studies. When Coquetteheard this she became sad and wistful."I hope" she said "I shall be always the same to you if you come backin one year--two years--ten years."And the Whaup thought that if she would only wait two years he wouldwork to such purpose as to be able to ask her to marry him.Before the cruise was ended Lord Earlshope who had the lonely man'shabit of playing spectator to his own emotions informed Coquette in animpersonal way that he had fallen in love with her."You are not responsible" said he shrugging his shoulders and speakingwithout bitterness. "All I ask is that you give me the benefit of yoursympathy. I have been flying my kite too near the thunder-cloud. Andwhat business had a man of my age with a kite""I am very sorry" she said softly.After this confession Coquette tried to avoid him as much as possiblebut one evening while she was sitting alone on deck watching the sunseton wild Loch Scavaig he came to her and told her he was going away. Heheld out his hand but she made no response. What was it he heard in thestillness of the night Moved by a great fear he knelt down and lookedinto her drooping face. She was sobbing bitterly. Then there broke onhim a revelation more terrible than his own sorrow."Why are you distressed It is nothing to you--my going away It cannotbe anything to you surely""It is very much" she said with a calmness of despair that startledhim. "I cannot bear it.""What have I done What have I done" he exclaimed. "Coquette Coquettetell me you do not mean this You do not understand my position. Whatyou say would be to any other man a joy unspeakable--the beginning of anew life to him but to me----" And he turned away with a shudder.It was she who was the comforter in the presence of an impossible love.Taking his hand gently she said in a quiet voice "I do not know whatyou mean but you must not accuse yourself for me. I have made aconfession--it was right to do that for you were going away. Now youwill go away knowing I am still your friend that I shall think of yousometimes though I shall pray never to see you any more until we areold people and may meet and laugh at the old stupid folly.""It shall not end thus" he cried. "Let the past be past Coquette andthe future ours. Let us seek a new country for ourselves. Let me takeyou away and make for you a new world. Why should we two be for evermiserable Coquette----""I am afraid of you now" she said drawing back in fear. "What are youAh I do see another face" And staggering she fell insensible on thedeck as the minister approached.That night Lord Earlshope left the yacht and this was his partingmessage written on a slip of paper "I was mad last night. I do notknow what I said. Forgive me for I cannot forgive myself."A winter's illness followed the strain of these emotional scenes but
comment176,with the spring Coquette resumed her morning moorland walks and drankin new life from the warm sweet breezes. One morning she came face toface with Lord Earlshope. With only a second's pause she stepped forwardand offered him her hand."Have you really forgiven me" he asked."That is all over" she said "and forgotten. It does no good to bringit back.""How very good you are I have wandered all over Europe feeling asthough I had the brand of Cain on my forehead.""That is nonsense" said Coquette. "Your talk of Cain your going awayyour fears--I do not understand it at all.""No" said he. "Nor would you ever understand without a series ofexplanations I have not the courage to make.""I do not understand" she replied "why all this secrecy--all thismystery""And I cannot tell you now" he said."I wish not to have any more whys" she said impatiently. "Explanationsthey never do good between friends. I am satisfied if you come to theManse and become as you were once. That is sufficient."She tried hard to keep the conversation on the level of friendship butwhen at last she turned to leave him ere she knew his arms were aroundher and kisses were being showered on her forehead and on her lips."Let me go--let me go" she pleaded piteously. "Oh what have we done""We have sealed our fate" said he with a haggard look. "I have foughtagainst this for many a day but now Coquette won't you look up andgive me one kiss before we part"But her downcast face was pale and deathlike and finally she said "Icannot speak to you now. To-morrow or next day--perhaps we shall meet."The next day she met him again and told him she was going to Glasgowwith Lady Drum to see her cousin the Whaup."I wonder" said Earlshope "if he hopes to win your love and isworking there with the intention of coming back and asking you to be hiswife.""And if that will make him happy" she said slowly and with absent eyes"I will do that if he demands it.""You will marry him and make him fancy that you love him""No I should tell him everything. I should tell him he deserves tomarry a woman who has never loved anyone but himself and yet that I
comment177,will be his wife if his marrying me will alone make him happy.""But Coquette--don't you see it cannot end here" he said almostdesperately. "You do not know the chains in which I am bound and I darenot tell you.""No I do not wish to know. It is enough for me to be beside you nowand if it should all prove bad and sorrowful I shall remember that onceI walked with you here and we had no thought of ill and were for alittle while happy."Talk of Glasgow being a sombre grey city To the Whaup it seemed thatthe empty pavements were made of gold that the fronts of the houseswere shining with a happy light and the air full of a delicioustingling. For did not the great city hold in it Coquette And as he spedhis boots clattered "Coquette Coquette Coquette" And presently he wastaking her out for a walk and cunningly drawing near to a trystingwell."Coquette" he said suddenly "do you know that lovers used to meethere and join their hands over the well and swear they would marryeach other some day Coquette if you would only give me your hand nowI will wait any time--I have waited already Coquette.""Oh do not say any more. I will do anything for you but not that--notthat." And then a moment afterwards she added "Or see I will promiseto marry you if you like after many many years--only not now--notwithin a few years.""What is the matter Coquette Does it grieve you to think of what Iask""No no" she said hurriedly "it is right of you to ask it--and I--Imust say Yes. My uncle does expect it does he not And you yourselfTom you have been very good to me and if only this will make you happyI will be your wife but not until after many years.""If you only knew how proud and happy you have made me" exclaimed Tomgaily. "I call upon the leaves of the trees and all the drops in theriver and all the light in the air to bear witness that I have wonCoquette for my wife.""Ah you foolish boy" she said sadly. "You have given me a dangerousname. But no matter if it pleases you to-day to think I shall be yourwife I am glad."_III.--The Opening of the Gates_Coquette who loved the sunshine as a drunkard loves drink was seatedin the park in Glasgow reading a book under her sunshade when LordEarlshope walked up to the place where she sat."Ah it is you I do wish much to see you for a few moments" she said."First I must tell you I have promised to my cousin to be his wife. Idid tell you I should do that now it is done and he is glad. And soas I am to be his wife I do not think it is right I should see you anymore.""Coquette" he said "have you resolved to make your life miserableWhat have you done""I have done what I ought to do. My cousin is very good he is very fondof me he will break his heart if I do not marry him. And I do like him
comment178,very well too. Perhaps in some years it will be a pleasure to me to behis wife.""Coquette" he interrupted "you do not blame me for being unable tohelp you. I am going to tell you why I cannot. Many a time have Idetermined to cell you.""Ah I know" she said. "You will tell me something you have done. I donot wish to hear it. I have often seen you about to tell me a secretand sometimes I have wondered too and wished to know but then I didthink there was enough trouble in the world without adding to it."Someone came along the road came as if to sit on the seat with them--awoman with a coarse red face and unsteady black eyes full ofmischievous amusement.Lord Earlshope rose and faced the stranger."You had better go home" he said to her. "I give you fair warning youhad better go home.""Why" said the woman with a loud laugh. "You have not said as much tome for six years back My dear" she added looking at Coquette "I amsorry to have disturbed you but do you know who I am I am LadyEarlshope""Coquette" said Earlshope "that is my wife."When the woman had walked away laughing and kissing her hand in tipsyfashion Coquette came a step nearer and held out her hand."I know it all now" she said "and am very sorry for you. I do now knowthe reason of many things and I cannot be angry when we are going awayfrom each other. Good-bye. I will hear of you sometimes through LadyDrum.""Good-bye Coquette" he said "and God bless you for your gentlenessand your sweetness and your forgiveness."It was to Lady Drum that Coquette made her confession that day."I do love him better than everything in the world--and I cannot helpit. And now he is gone and I shall never see him again and I wouldlike to see him only once to say I am sorry for him."Coquette returned to Airlie and tried to find peace in homely duties inthe village. As time went on the Whaup pressed for the marriage day tobe named but he could not awake in her hopes for the future. Then onedull morning in March as she walked by herself over the Moor LordEarlshope was by her side saying "Coquette have you forgottennothing as I have forgotten nothing" And she was saying "I love youdearest more than ever.""Listen Coquette listen" he said. "A ship passes here in the morningfor America I have taken two berths in it for you and me to-morrow weshall be sailing away to a new world and leaving all these troublesbehind. You remember that woman--nothing has been heard of her for twoyears. I have sought her everywhere. She must be dead. And so we shallbe married when we get there. The yacht will be waiting off Saltcoatsto-night you must go down by yourself and the gig shall come for youand we shall intercept the ship."A little while thereafter Coquette was on her way back to the Mansealone. She had promised to go down to Saltcoats that night and hadsealed her sin with a kiss.It was a wild strange night that she stole out of the house leavingbehind her all the sweet consciousness of rectitude and the purity andinnocence which had enabled her to meet trials with a courageousheart--leaving behind the crown of womanhood the treasure of astainless name. Every moment the storm grew in intensity till therain-clouds were blown upon the land in hissing torrents. At last justas she saw before her the lights of Saltcoats she sank down by theroadside with a faint cry of "Uncle Uncle"When she came to herself in a neighbour's house a letter was given herfrom Lord Earlshope saying that he could not exact from her thesacrifice he had proposed and incur for both the penalty of remorse andmisery so he would leave for America alone.Even as she was reading the letter the report reached Saltcoats that

It was not till the end was drawing near that she was told ofthe death of Lord Earlshope and her last journey was to Saltcoats tosee the wild waste of waters that were his grave.There came a night when she beckoned her husband to her and asked him ina scarcely audible voice "Tom am I going to die" And when in answerhe could only look at her sad eyes she said "I am not sorry. It willbe better for you and everyone and you will not blame me because Icould not make your life more happy for you--it was all a misfortune mycoming to this country.""Coquette Coquette" he said beside himself with grief "if you aregoing to die I will go with you too--see I will hold your hand andwhen the gates are open I will not let you go--I will go with youCoquette."Scarce half an hour afterwards the gates opened and she silently passedthrough while a low cry broke from his lips "So near--so near And Icannot go with her too"                                   R. D. BLACKMORELorna Doone     Richard Doddridge Blackmore one of the most famous English     novelists of the last generation was born on June 9 1825 at     Longworth Berkshire of which parish his father was vicar.     Like John Ridd the hero of "Lorna Doone" he was educated at     Blundell's School Tiverton. An early marriage with a     beautiful Portuguese girl and a long illness forced him to     live for some years in hard and narrow circumstances. Happily     in 1860 he came unexpectedly into a considerable fortune.     Settling down at Teddington he divided his life between the     delights of gardening and the pleasures of literature     cultivating his vines peaches nectarines pears and     strawberries and writing first sensational stories and     then historical romances. In 1869 with his third attempt in     fiction "Lorna Doone A Romance of Exmoor" he suddenly     became famous as a novelist and acted as the pioneer of the     new romantic movement in fiction which R. L. Stevenson and     other brilliant writers afterwards carried on. Lorna Doone is     the most famous of his heroines but in "Cradock Nowell" a     fine tale of the New Forest in "Alice Lorraine" a story of     the South Downs and in "The Maid of Sker" he has depicted     womanly types equal in charm to Lorna. He died at Teddington     on January 20 1900._I.--An Adventure in Glen Doone_Two miles below our farm at Oare the Bagworthy water runs into theLynn but though I fished nearly every stream in our part of Exmoor inmy boyhood it was a long time before I dared go those two miles. Forthe water flowed out of Glen Doone where the Doones had settled and Ihad good reason to be afraid of this wild band of outlaws. It was anunhappy day for everybody on Exmoor when Sir Ensor Doone was outlawed bygood King Charles and came with his tall sons and wild retainers to theBagworthy water.This befell in 1640. At first the newcomers were fairly quiet and what
comment180,little sheep-stealing they did was overlooked. But in the troubloustimes of the Great Rebellion they grew bolder and fiercer they attackedmen and burnt farms and carried off women and all Exmoor stood in fearand terror of them. None of the Doones was under six feet and therewere forty and more of them and they were all true marksmen. The worstthing they did was to murder my father John Ridd in the year 1673when I was twelve years of age.That was why I was afraid to fish the Bagworthy water. But I spent agood deal of time in learning to shoot straight with my father's gun Isent pretty well all the lead gutter round our little church into ourbest barn door a thing which has often repented me since especially aschurchwarden. When however I was turned fourteen years old and putinto small clothes and worsted hosen knitted by my dear mother I setout with a loach-fork to explore the Bagworthy water. It was St.Valentine's day 1676 as I well remember. After wading along Lynnstream I turned into the still more icy-cold current of Bagworthywater where I speared an abundance of loaches. I was stopped at last bya great black whirlpool into which a slide of water came thundering ahundred yards down a cliff. My bare legs were weak and numbed with coldand twilight was falling in the wild narrow glen. So I was inclined toturn back. But then I said to myself "John Ridd the place is making acoward of thee."With that I girt up my breeches anew and slung the fish tighter roundmy neck and began to climb up through the water-slide. The green wavecame down on me and my feet gave way but I held with my loach-fork to arock and got my footing. How I got up I cannot remember but I faintedon reaching the top of the cliff.When I came to a little girl was kneeling by me and rubbing myforehead tenderly with a dock-leaf."Oh I am glad" she said. "Now you will try to be better won't you"I had never heard so sweet a sound as came from her red lips neitherhad I ever seen anything so beautiful as the large dark eyes intentupon me in pity and wonder. Her long black hair fell on the grass andamong it--like an early star--was the first primrose of the year. Andsince that day I think of her whenever I see an early primrose."How you are looking at me" I said. "I have never seen anyone like youbefore. My name is John Ridd. What is your name""My name is Lorna Doone" she replied in a low voice and hanging herhead.Young and harmless as she was her name made guilt of her. Yet I could
comment181,not help looking at her tenderly. And when she began to cry what did Ido but kiss her. This made her angry but we soon became friends againand fell to talking about ourselves. Suddenly a shout rang through thevalley and Lorna trembled and put her cheek close to mine."Oh they will find us together and kill us" she said."Come with me" I whispered. "I can carry you down the waterfall.""No no" she cried as I took her up. "You see that hole in the rockthere There is a way out from the top of it."I hid myself just in time and a dozen tall fierce-looking men foundLorna seemingly lying asleep on the grass. One of them took her tenderlyin his arms and carried her away. I then waited until it was full darkand crept to the hole that Lorna had pointed out.The fright I had taken that night satisfied me for a long timethereafter not that I did not think of Lorna and wish very often to seeher. But I was only a boy and inclined therefore to despise younggirls. Besides our farm of five hundred acres was the largest in Oareand I had to work very hard on it. But the work did me good I grew fourinches longer every year and two inches wider until there was no manof my size to be seen elsewhere upon Exmoor and I also won the belt ofthe championship for wrestling in the West Counties._II.--John Ridd Goes A-Wooing_Seven years went by before I climbed up Glen Doone again. The occasionwas a strange one. My uncle Ben Huckaback was robbed by the Doones onhis way to our farm and he was mighty vexed with their doings. Thistime the outlaws met their match for Uncle Ben was one of the richestmen in the West Counties and moreover he was well acquainted with themost powerful and terrible man in England. I mean the famous Lord ChiefJustice Jeffreys."I am going to London my boy" he said to me "to get these scoundrelDoones shot or hanged. I want you while I am gone to go to the placewhere they live and see how the troops I shall bring can best attackthem."This put other thoughts in my head. I waited till St. Valentine's dayand then I dressed myself in my best clothes and went up the Bagworthywater. The stream which once had taken my knees now came only to myankles and with no great difficulty I climbed to the top of the cliff.Here I beheld the loveliest sight one glimpse of which was enough tomake me kneel in the coldest water. Lorna was coming singing towards meI could not see what her face was my heart so awoke and trembled onlythat her hair was flowing from a wreath of white violets. She turned tofly frightened perhaps at my great size but I fell on the grass asI had fallen seven years agone that day and just said "Lorna Doone""Master Ridd are you mad" she said. "The patrol will be herepresently."She led me with many timid glances to the hole in the rock which shehad shown me before by the right of this was a crevice hung with greenivy which opened into a mossy cave about twenty feet across."We shall be safe from interruption here" said Lorna "for I begged SirEnsor that this place might be looked on as my bower."I had much ado however to get through the crevice and instead ofbeing proud of my size as it seemed to me she ought to be Lornalaughed at me. Thereupon it went hard with me not to kiss her only itsmote me that this would be a low advantage of her trust and
comment182,helplessness. She seemed to know what I would be at and she liked mefor my forbearance because she was not in love with me yet. As we satin her bower she talked about her dear self and her talk was sad."Ah Master Ridd" she said "you have a mother who loves you andsisters and a quiet home. You do not know what loneliness is. I get sofull of anger at the violence and wickedness around me that I dare notgive way to speech. It is scarcely a twelvemonth since my cousin LordAlan Brandir came from London and tried to rescue me. Carver Doonekilled him before my eyes. Ah you know Carver"Ay I did. It was he who slew my father. I would not tell Lorna thisbut in my slow way I began to look forward to meeting Carver Doone notfor my father's sake--I had forgiven that--but for Lorna's. I boded someharm to her and before I left I arranged that if she were ever in needof help she should hang a black mantle on a stone that I could see froma neighbouring hill.When I got home I found a king's messenger waiting for me and to thealarm of my dear mother and my sisters I was taken to London to beexamined by Chief Justice Jeffreys touching the Doone. He was afierce-looking man with a bull-head but he used me kindly--maybe forUncle Ben's sake--and I got back to Exmoor none the worse for myjourney to the great city of London. But I lost all delight in myhomecoming when I went to the hill overlooking Glen Doone and saw thatthe stone was covered with a mantle. Off I set to climb the cliff abovethe Bagworthy water and there I found Lorna in a sad state of mind."Oh John" she said "Carver Doone is trying to force me to marry him.Where have you been Tis two months since I gave the signal."Thereupon I told her of my travels to London and when she learnt thatmy seeming negligence of her was nothing but my wretched absence faraway the tears fell from her eyes and she came and sat so close besideme that I trembled like a folded sheep at the bleating of her lamb."Dearest darling of my life" I whispered through her clouds of hair "Ilove you more than heart can hold in silence I have waited long andlong and though I am so far below you I can wait no longer""You have been very faithful John" she murmured to the fern and moss."You are the bravest and the kindest and the simplest of all men and Ilike you very much.""That will not do for me" I said. "I will not have liking I must haveyour heart of hearts even as you have mine Lorna"She glanced up shyly through her fluttering lashes. Then she opened wideupon me all the glorious depth and softness of her eyes and flung botharms around my neck."Darling" she cried "you have won it all I shall never be my ownagain. I am yours for ever and ever"I am sure I know not what I did or said thereafter being overcome withtransport by her words and her eyes."Hush" said Lorna suddenly drawing me away from the entrance to herbower. "Here is Carver Doone"A great man was coming leisurely down the valley and the light wasstill good enough for me to descry his features through the ivy screen.Though I am not a good judge of men's faces there was something in hiswhich gave me a feeling of horror. Not that it was an ugly face nayrather it seemed a handsome one full of strength and vigour andresolution but there was a cruel hankering in his steel-blue eyes. Yethe did not daunt me. Here I saw was a man of strength yet for me toencounter such as I had never met but would be glad to meet havingfound no man of late who needed not my mercy at wrestling orsinglestick. My heart was hot against him. And though he carried acarbine I would have been at him maybe ere he could use it but for
comment183,the presence of Lorna. So I crouched down until Carver Doone departedand then because she feared for my safety I returned home._III.--Love Amid the Snows_I found the king's messenger waiting again for me. He was a small butkeen-witted man called Jeremy Stickler and I liked his company. He nowcame upon a graver business than conducting me to London. He held aroyal commission to raise the train-bands of Somerset and Devon and hebrought a few troops with him and made our farm his headquarters. Hehad been sent in hot haste by Chief Justice Jeffreys to destroy theDoones who were likely now to pay dearly for robbing my Uncle Ben. I wasnot however as pleased with the arrival of Jeremy Stickler as heexpected for I bethought myself how Lorna would fare in the wildfighting.The next evening I went to her bower to tell her of the matter but shewas not there. Then the snow began to fall and still I clambered up thecliff and waited at the end of the valley every hour of the day and farinto the night. But no light footstep came to meet me and no sweetvoice was in the air. At last I resolved upon a desperate and difficultenterprise for I was well-nigh mad with anxiety. I would go to Lorna'shouse and find out at all costs what had befallen her. But though Iknew fairly well where her house was in Doone village I was perplexedhow to get there. I could not even get to her bower for in the night agreat snow-storm broke over the country--the worst since 1625. Our farmwas drifted up and in some places the snow was thirty and fifty feetdeep. Travel of any sort seemed impossible. But my elder sister Lizziewhom I looked down on because she was always reading books instead ofhelping my mother as Annie did came to my help. She had a wonderful lotof book learning--much more than I ever got though father had sent meto the famous grammar school at Tiverton founded by Master Blundell. Shenow showed me how to make some strange contrivances called snowshoeswhich men use in very cold countries. Having learnt how to glide aboutin them I set off to find Lorna.By good fortune when I got to Glen Doone where the waterfall hadfrozen into rough steps easy to climb the snow came on again thickenough to blind a man who had not spent his time among it as I had fordays and days. The weather drove all the Doones indoors and I foundLorna's house almost drifted up like our farm but got at last to thedoor and knocked. I was not sure but that the answer might not be themouth of a carbine but Gwenny Carfax a little Cornish maid attached tomy Lorna opened it and said when she saw me"Master Ridd I wish you was good to eat. Us be shut in here andstarving."The look of wolfish hunger in her eyes frightened me and I strode inand found Lorna fainting for want of food. Happily I had a good loaf ofbread and a large mince pie which I had brought in case I had to bideout all night. When Lorna and her maid had eaten these I heard the taleof their sufferings. Sir Ensor Doone was dead and Carver Doone was nowthe leader and he was trying to starve Lorna into agreeing to marryhim."If I warrant to bring you safe and sound to our farm Lorna will youcome with me" I said."To be sure I will dear" said my darling. "I must either starve or gowith you John."Our plans were soon made. I went home with the utmost speed and got outour light pony-sled and dragged it to the top of the waterfall near my
comment184,darling's bower. It was well I returned quickly. When I entered Lorna'shouse I saw by the moonlight flowing in a sight which drove me beyondsense. Lorna was crouching behind a chair in utter terror and a drunkenDoone was trying to draw the chair away. I bore him out of the house aslightly as I would a baby but I squeezed his throat a little more thanI would an infant's then I pitched him into a snow-drift and he didnot move.It was no time to linger. I ran with Lorna in my arms to the sled andGwenny followed. Then with my staff from rock to rock I broke thesled's too rapid way down the frozen waterfall and brought my darlingsafely out of Glen Doone by the selfsame path which first led me up toher. In an hour's time she was under my roof and my dear mother and mysisters were tending her and Gwenny for they both were utterly worn outby their cruel privations._IV.--A Night of Fire and Blood_It gave me no little pleasure to think how mad Carver Doone must be withme for robbing him of the lovely bride whom he was trying to starve intomarriage. However I was not pleased with the prospect of theconsequences but set all hands to work to prepare for the attack on thefarm which I saw would follow when the paths were practicable. By thetime the rain fell and cleared the snow away I had everything ready.The outlaws waited till the moon was risen as it was dangerous to crossthe flooded valley in the darkness and then they rode into our farmyardas coolly as if they had been invited. Jeremy Stickler and his trooperswere waiting in the shadow of the house and I stood with a club and agun in the mow-yard for I knew the Doones would begin by firing ourricks."Two of you go"--it was the deep voice of Carver Doone--"and make us alight to cut their throats by."As he spoke I set my gun against his breast. Yet--will you believeme--I could not pull the trigger. Would to God I had done so But I hadnever taken human life. I dropped my carbine and grasped my club whichseemed a more straightforward implement. With this I struck down thefirst man that put a torch to the rick and broke the collar-bone of thesecond. Then a blaze of light came from the house and two of the Doonesfell under the fire of the troopers and the rest hung back. They werenot used to this kind of reception from farmers they thought it neitherkind nor courteous. Unable any longer to contain myself I came acrossthe yard. But no one shot at me and I went up to Carver Doone and tookhim by the beard and said "Do you call yourself a man"He was so astonished that he could not speak. He saw he had met hisequal or perhaps his master. He held a pistol at me but I was tooquick for him and I laid him flat upon his back."Now Carver Doone take warning" I said to him. "You have shownyourself a fool by your contempt of me. I may not be your match incraft but I am in manhood. Lay low there in your native muck."
comment185,Seeing him down the others broke and ran but one had a shot at me. Andwhile I was feeling my wound--which was nothing much--Carver arose andstrode away with a train of curses.But he had his revenge in a short time. Jeremy Stickler brought up twotrain-bands to storm Glen Doone and they were beaten off withconsiderable loss. Then I took the matter up just when the Doones wereemboldened by their victory to commit fresh crimes or rather theleadership was thrust upon me. Carver Doone and one of his men enteredthe house of Kit Badcock one of my neighbours and killed his baby andcarried off his wife. Kit wandered about half crazy and the people cameflocking about me and asked me to lead them against the Doones. Iresolved on a night-assault and divided the men into two parties. TheDoone-gate was I knew impregnable and it was there that the train-bands had failed. I pretended to attack it but led my best fighters upthe waterfall. The earliest notice the Doones had of our presence wasthe blazing of the logwood house where lived that villain Carver.By the time they came from Doone-gate all the village was burning andas soon as they got into easy distance we shot them down in the light ofthe flaming houses. I did not fire. I cared to meet none but Carver andhe did not appear. He was the only Doone that escaped. Every man I hadwith me had some wrong to avenge some had lost their wives otherstheir daughters the more fortunate had had all their sheep and cattlecarried off and every man avenged his wrong. I was vexed at the escapeof Carver. It was no light thing to have a man of such power andresource and desperation left at large and furious. When he saw all thehouses in the valley flaming with a handsome blaze and throwing a finelight around such as he had often revelled in when he was the attackerhe turned his great black horse and spurred it through Doone-gate andhe passed into the darkness before the yeomen I had posted there couldbring him down._V.--The Duel at Wizard's Slough_The only thing which pleased me was that Lorna was taken to Londonbefore I led the assault on Glen Doone. Jeremy Stickler a man with muchknowledge of the law discovered that she was a great heiress and thather true title was Lady Lorna Dugal. She was related to the Doones andthey had carried her off when a little child and on her all theambition of Sir Ensor Doone had turned. The marriage he designed betweenher and Carver would have brought the outlaws the wealth necessary toretrieve their fortunes and recover their position in the world. Thisstrange news explained many things in their conduct towards Lorna butit made me feel rather sad. For it seemed to me that there was too greata difference between John Ridd the yeoman farmer and Lady Lorna theheiress of the Earl of Lome. Besides she was now a ward of chanceryunder the care of the great Lord Jeffreys and I much doubted if hewould consent to our marriage even if she still remembered me amid thecourtly splendour in which she moved. Judge then of my joy when Lornareturned in the spring to our farm as glad as a bird to get back to itsnest."Oh I love it all" she said. "The scent of the gorse on the moorsdrove me wild and the primroses under the hedges. I am sure I was meantto be a farmer's wife."This with a tender playful look at me. Then she told the good news.Lord Jeffreys had for a certain round sum given his ward permission tomarry me. There was a great to-do throughout the country about ourwedding on Whit-Monday. People came from more than thirty miles aroundupon excuse of seeing Lorna's beauty and my stature but in good truth
comment186,out of curiosity and a love of meddling.It is impossible for any who have not loved as I have to conceive myjoy and pride when after the ring and all was done and the parson hadblessed us she turned and gazed on me. Her eyes were so full of faithand devotion that I was amazed thoroughly as I knew them. But when Istooped to kiss her as the bridegroom is allowed to do a shot rangthrough the church. My darling fell across my knees and her bloodflowed out on the altarsteps. She sighed a long sigh to my breast andgrew cold. I laid her in my mother's arms and went forth for myrevenge.The men fell back before me. Who showed me the course I cannot tell. Ionly know that I leaped upon a horse and took it. Weapon of no sort hadI. Unarmed and wondering at my strange attire I rode out to discoverthis whether in this world there be or be not a God of justice. Puttingmy horse at a furious speed I came upon Black Burrow Down and there afurlong before me rode a man on a great black horse. I knew that manwas Carver Doone bearing his child little Ensie before him. I knew hewas strong. I knew he was armed with gun pistol and sword.Nevertheless I had no more doubt of killing him than a cook has ofspitting a headless fowl.I came up with him at Wizard's Slough. A bullet struck me somewhere butI took no heed of that. With an oak stick I felled his horse. CarverDoone lay on the ground stunned. Leaping from my steed I waited andbared my arms as if in the ring for wrestling. Then the boy ran towardsme clasped my leg and looked up at me."Ensie dear" I said "run and try to find a bunch of bluebells for thepretty lady."Presently Carver Doone gathered together his mighty limbs and I closedwith him. He caught me round the waist with such a grip as had neverbeen laid upon me. I heard a rib go where the bullet had broken it. ButGod was with me that day. I grasped Carver Doone's arm and tore themuscle out of it then I had him by the throat and I left him sinkingjoint by joint into the black bog.I returned to the farm in a dream and only the thought of Lorna'sdeath like a heavy knell was tolling in the belfry of my brain. Intothe old farmhouse I tottered like a weakling child with mother helpingme along yet fearing except by stealth to look at me."I have killed him" was all I said "even as he killed Lorna.""Lorna is still living John" said my mother very softly."Is there any chance for her" I cried awaking out of my dream. "Forme I mean for me"Well my darling is sitting by me now as I write and I am now Sir JohnRidd if you please. Year by year Lorna's beauty grows with the growthof goodness kindness and true happiness--above all with loving. Forchange she makes a joke of this and plays with it and laughs at it.Then when my slow nature marvels back she comes to the earnest thing.
comment187,If I wish to pay her out--as may happen once or twice when we becometoo galdsome--I bring her to sadness and to me for the cure of it bythe two words "Lorna Doone."                                   GIOVANNI BOCCACCIOThe Decameron Or Ten Days' Entertainment     Giovanni Boccaccio the father of Italian prose literature     was born in 1313 probably at Certaldo a small town about     twenty miles from Florence where he was brought up. In 1341     he fell in love with the daughter of King Robert of Naples     and the lady whom he made famous under the name of Fiammetta     seems to have loved him in return. It was for her amusement     and for the amusement of the Queen of Naples that he composed     many of the stories in "The Decameron." He returned to     Florence in 1350 after the great plague which he has     described in so vivid a manner in the opening chapter of his     great work had abated and three years afterwards he     published "The Decameron" the title being derived from the     Greek words signifying "ten days." This collection of a     hundred stories is certainly one of the world's great books.     Many English writers of the first order have gone to it for     inspiration. Boccaccio's friend Petrarch was so delighted     with the tale of Griselda with which the work concludes that     he learnt it off by heart. Chaucer developed it into the     finest of all his stories. Dryden Keats and Tennyson have     also been inspired by Boccaccio while Lessing has made the     Italian story-teller's allegory of "The Three Rings" the     jeweled point on which turns his masterly play. "Nathan the     Wise" see Vol. XVII. Boccaccio after filling many high     posts at Florence retired to Certaldo where he died on     December 21 1375._The Seven Beautiful Maidens_In the year of our Lord 1348 a terrible plague broke out in Florencewhich from being the finest city in Italy became the most desolate. Itwas a strange malady that no drugs could cure and it was communicatednot merely by conversing with those strickened by the pestilence buteven by touching their clothes or anything they had worn. As soon asthe purple spots which were the sign of the disease appeared on thebody death was certain to ensue within three days.So great were the terror and disorder and distress that all laws humanand divine were disregarded. Everybody in Florence did just as hepleased. The wilder sort broke into the houses of rich persons and gavethemselves over to riotous living exclaiming that since it wasimpossible to avoid dying from the plague they would at least diemerrily. Others shut themselves up from the rest of the world and livedon spare diet and many thousands fled from their houses into the opencountry leaving behind them all their goods and wealth and all theirrelatives and friends. Brother fled from brother wife from husbandand what was more cruel even parents forsook their own children. Itwas perilous to walk the streets for they were strewn with the bodiesof plague-strickened wretches and I have seen with my own eyes the verydogs perish that touched their rags.Between March and July a hundred thousand persons died in Florencethough before the calamity the city was not supposed to have containedso many inhabitants. But I am weary of recounting out late miseriesand passing by everything that I can well omit I shall only observethat when the city was almost depopulated seven beautiful youngladies in deep mourning met one Tuesday evening in Saint Mary'sChurch where indeed they composed the whole of the congregation. Theywere all related to each other either by the ties of birth or by themore generous bonds of friendship. Pampinea the eldest wastwenty-eight years of age Fiammetta was a little younger FilomenaEmilia Lauretta and Neifile were still more youthful and Elisa wasonly eighteen years old.After the service was over they got into a corner of the church and
comment188,began to devise what they should do for they were now alone in theworld."I would advise" said Pampinea "that we should leave Florence for thecity is now dangerous to live in not merely by reason of the plaguebut because of the lawless men that prowl about the streets and breakinto our houses. Let us retire together into the country where the airis pleasanter and the green hills and the waving corn-fields afford amuch more agreeable prospect than these desolate walls.""I doubt" said Filomena "if we could do this unless we got some man tohelp us.""But how can we" exclaimed Elisa. "Nearly all the men of our circle aredead and the rest have gone away."While they were talking three handsome young cavaliers--PamfiloFilostrato and Dioneo--came into the church looking for theirsweethearts who by chance were Neifile Pampinea and Filomena."See" said Pampinea with a smile "fortune is on our side. She hasthrown in our way three worthy gentlemen who I am sure will come withus if we care to invite them."She then acquainted the cavaliers with her design and begged them tohelp her to carry it out. At first they took it all for a jest but whenthey found that the ladies were in earnest they made arrangements toaccompany them. So the next morning at the break of day the ladies andtheir maids and the cavaliers and their men-servants set out fromFlorence and after travelling for two miles they came to the appointedplace. It was a little wooded hill remote from the highway on the topof which was a stately palace with a beautiful court and finegalleries and splendid rooms adorned with excellent paintings. Andaround it were fair green meadows a delightful garden fountains ofwater and pleasant trees.Finding that everything in the palace had been set in order for theirreception the ladies and their cavaliers took a walk in the garden anddiverted themselves by singing love-songs and weaving garlands offlowers. At three o'clock dinner was laid in the banqueting hall andwhen this was over Dioneo took a lute and Fiammetta a viol and playeda merry air while the rest of the company danced to the music. When thedance was ended they began to sing and so continued dancing andsinging until nightfall. The cavaliers then retired to their chambersand the ladies to theirs after arranging that Pampinea should be thequeen of their company for the following day and direct all theirfeasts and amusements.The next morning Queen Pampinea called them all up at nine o'clocksaying it was unwholesome to sleep in the daytime and led them into ameadow of deep grass shadowed by tall trees."As the sun is high and hot" she continued "and nothing is to be heardbut the chirping of grasshoppers among the olives it would be folly tothink of walking. So let us sit down in a circle and tell stories. Bythe time the tales have gone round the heat of the sun will haveabated and we can then divert ourselves as best we like. Now Pamfilo"
comment189,she said turning to the cavalier on her right hand "pray begin."_Cymon and Iphigenia A Tale of Love_Of all the stories that have come into my mind said Pamfilo there isone which I am sure you will all like for it shows how strange andwonderful is the power of love. Some time ago there lived in the islandof Cyprus a man of great rank and wealth called Aristippus who wasvery unhappy because his son Cymon though very tall and handsome wasfeeble in intellect. Finding that the most skilful teacher could notbeat the least spark of knowledge into the head of his son Aristippusmade Cymon live out of his sight among the slaves in his country-house.There Cymon used to drudge like one of the slaves whom indeed heresembled in the harshness of his voice and the uncouthness of hismanners. But one day as he was tramping round the farm with his staffupon his shoulder he came upon a beautiful maiden sleeping in the deepgrass of a meadow with two women and a manservant slumbering at herfeet. Cymon had never seen the face of a woman before and leaning uponhis staff he gazed in blank wonder at the lovely girl and strangethoughts and feelings began to work within him. After watching her for along time he saw her eyes slowly open and there was a sweetness aboutthem that filled him with joy."Why are you looking at me like that" she said. "Please go away. Youfrighten me""I will not go away" he answered "I cannot"And though she was afraid of him he would not leave her until he hadled her to her own house. He then went to his father and said he wantedto live like a gentleman and not like a slave. His father was surprisedto find that his voice had grown soft and musical and his mannerswinning and courteous. So he dressed him in clothes suitable to his highstation and let him go to school. Four years after he had fallen inlove Cymon became the most accomplished young gentleman in Cyprus. Hethen went to the father of Iphigenia for such was her name and askedfor her in marriage. But her father replied that she was alreadypromised to Pasimondas a young nobleman of Rhodes and that theirnuptials were about to be celebrated."O Iphigenia" said Cymon to himself on hearing the unhappy news "itis now time for me to show you how I love you Love for you has made aman of me and marriage with you would make me as happy and as gloriousas a god Have you I will or else I will die"He at once prevailed upon some young noblemen who were his friends tohelp him in fitting out a ship of war. With this he waylaid the vesselin which Iphigenia embarked for Rhodes. Throwing a grappling iron uponthis ship Cymon drew it close to his own. Then without waiting foranyone to second him he jumped among his enemies and drove them likesheep before him till they threw down their arms."I have not come to plunder you" said Cymon "but to win the noblemaiden Iphigenia whom I love more than aught else in the world. Resignher to me and I will do you no harm"Iphigenia came to him all in tears."Do not weep my sweet lady" he said to her tenderly. "I am your Cymonand my long and constant love is worth more than all Pasimondas'spromises."She smiled at him through her tears and he led her on board his shipand sailed away to Crete where he and his friends had relations andacquaintances. But in the night a violent tempest arose and blotted outall the stars of heaven and whirled the ship about and drove it into a
comment190,little bay upon the island of Rhodes a bow-shot from the place wherethe Rhodian ship had just arrived.Before they could put out to sea again Pasimondas came with an armedhost and took Cymon a prisoner and led him to the chief magistrate ofthe Rhodians for that year Lysimachus who sentenced him and hisfriends to perpetual imprisonment on the charge of piracy andabduction.While Cymon was languishing in prison with no hope of ever obtaininghis liberty Pasimondas prepared for his nuptials with Iphigenia. NowPasimondas had a younger brother called Hormisdas who wanted to marry abeautiful lady Cassandra with whom the chief magistrate Lysimachus wasalso in love. Pasimondas thought it would save a good deal of troubleand expense if he and his brother were to marry at the same time. So hearranged that this should be done. Thereupon Lysimachus was greatlyangered. After a long debate with himself honour gave way to love andhe resolved at all hazards to carry off Cassandra.But whom should he get as companions in this wild enterprise He at oncethought of Cymon and his friends and he fetched them out of prison andarmed them and concealed them in his house. On the wedding-day hedivided them into three parties. One went down to the shore and secureda ship one watched at the gate of Pasimondas's house and the thirdparty headed by Cymon and Lysimachus rushed with drawn swords into thebridal chamber and killed the two bridegrooms and bore the tearful butby no means unwilling brides to the ship and sailed joyfully away forCrete.There they espoused their ladies amidst the congratulations of theirrelatives and friends and though by reason of their actions a greatquarrel ensued between the two islands of Cyprus and Rhodes everythingwas at last amicably adjusted. Cymon then returned with Iphigenia toCyprus and Lysimachus carried Cassandra back to Rhodes and all of themlived very happily to the end of their days._Gisippus and Titus A Tale of Friendship_As Pamfilo has told us so excellent a tale about the force of love saidFilomena I will now relate a story showing the great power offriendship.At the time when Octavius Csar who afterwards became the EmperorAugustus was governing Rome as a triumvir a young Roman gentlemanTitus Quintius Fulvus went to Athens to study philosophy. There hebecame acquainted with a noble young Athenian named Gisippus and abrotherly affection sprang up between them and for three years theystudied together and lived under the same roof.In the meantime Gisippus fell in love with a young and beautifulAthenian maiden named Sophronia and a marriage was arranged betweenthem. Some days before the marriage Gisippus took his friend with himon a visit to his lady. It was the first time that Titus had seenSophronia and as he looked upon her beauty he grew as much enamoured asever a man in the world was with a woman. So great was his passion thathe could neither eat nor sleep and he grew so sick that at last he was
comment191,unable to rise from his bed. Gisippus was extremely grieved at hisillness and knowing that it must have been caused by some secret maladyof the mind he pressed him to reveal the cause of his grief. At lengthTitus unable to restrain himself any longer said with his facestreaming with tears"O Gisippus I am unworthy of the name of friend I have fallen in lovewith Sophronia and it is killing me. How base I am But pardon me mydear friend for I feel that I shall soon be punished for my disloyaltyby death"Gisippus stood for some time in suspense by the bed side of Titusdivided between the claims of love and the claims of friendship. But atlast he resolved to save his friend's life at the cost of his ownhappiness. Some days afterwards Sophronia was brought to his house forthe bridal ceremony to be consummated. Going softly into the bridalchamber where the bride was lying he put out the candles and then wentsilently to Titus and told him that he might be the bridegroom. Tituswas so overcome with shame that he refused to go but Gisippus sopassionately entreated him that at last he consented. Going into thedark bridal chamber he softly asked Sophronia if she would be his wife.She thinking it was Gisippus replied "Yes." Then taking a ring ofvalue and putting it upon her finger Titus said "And I will be yourhusband."In the morning Sophronia discovered the trick that had been put uponher. Stealing out of the house she went to her father and mother andtold them that Gisippus had deceived her and married her to Titus.Great was the resentment against Gisippus throughout Athens forSophronia came of a very ancient and noble family.But seeing that what had been done could not be undone the parents ofthe bride at last allowed Titus to lead her to Rome where the scandalwould not be known. But when Titus was gone they resolved to takevengeance upon Gisippus. A powerful party was formed against him whosucceeded in getting him stripped of all his possessions driven fromAthens and condemned to perpetual exile.Friendless and beggared Gisippus slowly travelled on foot to Romeintending to ask Titus to help him. He found that his friend was now arich and powerful man enjoying the favour of the young Prince Octaviusand living in a splendid palace. Gisippus did not dare to enter it ashis clothes were now worn to rags so he stood humbly by the gate like abeggar hoping that his friend would recognise him and speak to him. ButTitus came out in a hurry and never even stopped to look at him andGisippus thinking that he was now despised went away confounded withgrief and despair.Wandering at random about the streets he came at nightfall to a cavernwhere thieves were wont to gather and laid down on the hard ground andwept himself to sleep. While he was sleeping two thieves entered withtheir booty and began to quarrel about it whereupon one killed theother and fled. In the morning some watchmen found Gisippus sleepingbeside the dead body and arrested him.
comment192,"Yes I killed him" said Gisippus who was now resolved to die andthought that this would be a better way than taking his own life.Thereupon the judge sentenced him to be crucified which was the usualmanner of death in these cases. By a strange chance however Titus cameinto the hall to defend a poor client. He instantly recognised Gisippusand wondering greatly at the sad change of his fortune he determinedat all costs to save him. But the case had gone so far that there wasonly one way of doing this. And Titus took it. Stepping resolutely up tothe judge he greatly astonished everyone by exclaiming"Recall thy sentence. This person is innocent I killed the man"Gisippus turned round in astonishment and seeing Titus he concludedthat he was trying to save him for friendship's sake. But he wasdetermined that he would not accept the sacrifice."Do not believe him sir. I was the murderer. Let the punishment fall onme" he said to the judge.The judge was amazed to see two men contending for the torture ofcrucifixion with as much eagerness as if it had been the highest honourin the world and suddenly a notorious thief who had been standing inthe court came forward and made this surprising declaration"This strange debate has so moved me that I will confess everything" hesaid. "You cannot believe sir that either of these men committed themurder. What should a man of the rank and wealth of Titus have to do ina thieves' cavern He was never there. But this poor ragged strangerwas sleeping in a corner when I and my fellow entered. Thieves youknow sometimes fall out especially over their booty. This was whathappened last night and to put an end to the quarrel I used a knife."The appearance of a third self-accuser so perplexed the judge that heput the case before Octavius Csar and Csar called the three men upbefore him. Thereupon Titus and Gisippus related to him at length thestrange story of their friendship and he set the two friends atliberty and even pardoned the thief for their sakes.Titus then took Gisippus to his house and forced him to accept a half ofhis great wealth and married him to his sister Fulvia a very charmingand lovely young noblewoman.For the rest of their lives Titus and Sophronia and Gisippus andFulvia lived very happily together in the same palace in Rome andevery day added something to their contentment and felicity._The Three Rings A Tale of Ingenuity_It was now Neifile's turn to tell a story and she said that as therehad been much controversy at Florence during the plague concerningreligion this had put her in mind of the tale of Melchizedeck.This man was a very rich Jew who lived at Alexandria in the reign ofgreat Sultan Saladin. Saladin being much impoverished by his wars hada mind to rob Melchizedeck. In order to get a pretext for plundering the
comment193,Jew he sent for him."I hear that thou art very wise in religious matters" said Saladin"and I wish to know which religion thou judgest to be the true one--theJewish the Mohammedan or the Christian"The Jew saw that Saladin wanted to trap him. If he said that the Jewishor the Christian faith was the true one he would be condemned as aninfidel. If on the other hand he agreed that the Mohammedan religionwas preferable to the others the sultan would say that a wealthybeliever ought to contribute largely to the expenses of the state. Afterconsidering how best to avoid the snare the wise Jew replied"Some time ago your majesty there was a man who had a ring of greatbeauty and value. And he declared in his will that the son to whom thisring was bequeathed should be the head of the family and that hisdescendants should rule over the descendants of the other sons. For manygenerations his wishes were carried out but at last the ring came intothe possession of a man who had three sons all virtuous and dutiful totheir father and equally beloved by him."Being at a loss which son to prefer above the others the good man gota skilful craftsman to make two rings which were so like the first thathe himself scarcely knew the true one. On his deathbed he gave one ofthese rings privately to each of his sons. Each of them afterwards laidclaim to the government of the family and produced the ring which hisfather had given him. But the rings were so much alike that it wasimpossible to tell which was the true one and even to this day no onehas been able to decide upon the matter. Thus has it happened sire inregard to the three laws of faith derived from God--Jew Mohammedan andChristian. Each believes that he is the true heir of the Almighty butit is just as uncertain which has received the true law as it is whichhas received the true ring."Saladin was mightily pleased at the ingenious way in which Melchizedeckescaped from the snare that had been spread for him. Instead of takingby force the money that he wanted from the Jew he desired him toadvance it on loan. This Melchizedeck did and Saladin soon afterwardsrepaid the money and gave him presents besides maintaining him nobly atcourt and making him his life-long friend.For some days the ladies and cavaliers entertained one another withdancing and singing and story-telling. And then as the plague hadabated in Florence they returned to the city. But before they wentDioneo told them a very strange and moving tale._Griselda A Tale of Wifely Patience_Men said Dioneo are wont to charge women with fickleness andinconstancy but there comes into my mind a story of a woman's constancyand a man's cruelty which I think you will agree is worth the telling.Gualtieri the young Marquis of Saluzzo was a man who did not believethat any woman could be true and constant all her life. And for thisreason he would not marry but spent his whole time in hawking andhunting. His subjects however did not want him to die without an heirand leave them without a lord and they were always pressing him tomarry. They went so far at last as to offer to provide a lady for him.This made him very angry."If I want a wife my friends" he said "I will choose one myself. Andlook you whatever her birth and upbringing are pay her the respect dueto her as my lady or you shall know to your cost how grievous it is tome to have taken a wife when I did not want one."A few days afterwards he was riding through a village not far from hispalace when he saw a comely shepherd girl carrying water from a well to
comment194,her father's house."What is your name" said the young marquis."Griselda" said the shepherd girl."Well Griselda" said the Marquis of Saluzzo "I am looking for a wife.If I marry you will you study to please me and carry out all mydemands whatever they are without a murmur or a sullen look""Yes my lord" said Griselda.Thereupon the marquis sent his servants to fetch some rich and costlyrobes and leading Griselda out by the hand he clothed her in gorgeousapparel and set a coronet upon her head and putting her on a palfreyhe led her to his palace. And there he celebrated his nuptials with asmuch pomp and grandeur as if he had been marrying the daughter of theKing of France.Griselda proved to be a good wife. She was so sweet-natured and sogentle and kind in her manners that her husband thought himself thehappiest man in the world and her subjects honoured her and loved hervery dearly. In a very short time her winning behaviour and her goodworks were the common subject of talk throughout the country and greatwere the rejoicings when a daughter was born to her.Unfortunately her husband got a strange fancy into his head. Heimagined she was good and gentle merely because everything went wellwith her and with great harshness he resolved to try her patience bysuffering. So he told her that the people were greatly displeased withher by reason of her mean parentage and murmured because she had givenbirth to a daughter."My lord" said Griselda "I know I am meaner than the meanest of mysubjects and that I am unworthy of the dignity to which you haveadvanced me. Deal with me I pray as you think best for your honour andhappiness and waste no thought upon me."Soon afterwards one of his servants came to Griselda and said "MadamI must either lose my own life or obey my lord's commands. He hasordered me to take your daughter and--"He would not say anything more and Griselda thought that he had ordersto kill the child. Taking it out of the cradle she kissed it andtenderly laid it in the servant's arms. The marquis sent the little girlto one of his relatives at Bologna to be brought up and educated. Someyears afterwards Griselda gave birth to a boy. The marquis naturallyenough was mightily pleased to have an heir but he took also thischild away from his wife."I am not able to live any longer with my people" he said. "They saythey will not have a grandson of a poor shepherd as their future lord. Imust dispose of this child as I did the other.""My lord" replied Griselda "study your own ease and happiness withoutthe least care for me. Nothing is pleasing to me that is not pleasing toyou."The next day the marquis sent for his son in the same way as he had sentfor his daughter and had him brought up with her at Bologna. His peoplethought that the children had been put to death and blamed him for hiscruelty and showed great pity for his wife. But Griselda would notallow them to attack her husband but found excuses for him.In spite of this the marquis did not yet believe in the constancy andfidelity of his wife and about sixteen years after their marriage heresolved to put her to a test."Woman" he said "I am going to take another wife. I shall send youback to your father's cottage in the same state as I brought you fromit and choose a young lady of my own rank in life."With the utmost difficulty Griselda kept back her tears and humblyconsented to be divorced. The marquis stripped her of her fine raimentand sent her back to her father's hut dressed in a smock. Her husbandthen gave it out that he was about to espouse the daughter of the Countof Panago and sending for Griselda he said"I am about to bring home my new bride but I have no woman with me toset out the rooms and order the ceremony. As you are well acquaintedwith the government of my palace I wish you to act as mistress for aday or two. Get everything in order and invite what ladies you will tothe festival. When the marriage is over you must return to yourfather's hut."These words pierced like daggers to the heart of Griselda. She was
comment195,unable to part with her love for her husband as easily as she had partedwith her high rank and great fortune."My lord" said Griselda "I swore that I would be obedient to you andI am ready to fulfil all your commands."She went into the palace in her coarse attire and worked with theservants sweeping the rooms and cleaning the furniture. After this wasdone she invited all the ladies in the country to come to the festival.And on the day appointed for the marriage she received them still cladin her coarse attire but with smiling and gentle looks. At dinner-timethe marquis arrived with his new lady--who was indeed a very beautifulgirl. After presenting her to all the guests many of whom congratulatedhim on making so good an exchange he said with a smile to Griselda"What do you think of my bride""My lord" she replied "I like her extremely well. If she is as wise asshe is fair you may be the happiest man in the world with her. But Ivery humbly beg that you will not take with this lady the same heart-breaking measures you took with your last wife because she is young andtenderly educated while the other was from a child used to hardship."Pardon me Pardon me Pardon me" said the marquis. "I know I havetried you harshly Griselda. But I did not believe in the goodness andconstancy of woman and I would not believe in them until you proved mein the wrong. Let me restore in one sweet minute all the happinessthat I have spent years in taking away from you. This young lady mydear Griselda is your daughter and mine And look Here is our sonwaiting behind her."He led Griselda weeping for joy to her children. Then all the ladiesin the hall rose up from the tables and taking Griselda into a chamberthey clothed her in fine and noble raiment and stayed with her manydays feasting and rejoicing. And the marquis sent for Griselda'sfather the poor shepherd and gave him a suite of rooms in the palacewhere he lived in great happiness with his daughter and hisgrandchildren and his noble son-in-law.END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WORLD'S GREATEST BOOKS VOL.

GEORGE BORROWLavengro      George Henry Borrow was born at East Dereham Norfolk     England July 5 1803. His father was an army captain and     Borrow's boyhood was spent at military stations in various     parts of the kingdom. From his earliest youth he had a taste     for roving and fraternising with gipsies and other vagrants.     In 1819 he entered a solicitor's office at Norwich. After a     long spell of drudgery and literary effort he went to London     in 1824 but left a year later and for some time afterwards     his movements were obscure. For a period of about five years     beginning 1835 he acted as the Bible Society's agent selling     and distributing Bibles in Spain and in 1842 he published     "The Bible in Spain." which appears in another volume of THE     WORLD'S GREATEST BOOKS. See TRAVEL AND ADVENTURE.     "Lavengro" written in 1851 enhanced the fame which Borrow     had already secured by his earlier works. The book teems with     character sketches drawn from real life in quarters which few     could penetrate and although they are often extremely     eccentric they are never grotesque and never strike the mind     with a sense of merely invented unreality. Here and there     occur illuminating outbursts of reflection in philosophic
comment202,     accent which reveal in startling style the working of Borrow's     mind. The linguistic lore is phenomenal as in all his books.     But though the wild passionate scenes make the whole     narrative an indescribable phantasmagoria the diction is     always free from turgidity and from involved periods. Borrow     died at Oulton Suffolk on July 26 1881. A mighty athlete     an inveterate wanderer a philological enthusiast and a man     of large-hearted simplicity mingled with violent prejudices     he was one of the most original and engaging personalities of     nineteenth century English literature._I.--The Scholar the Gipsy the Priest_On an evening of July in the year 18-- at East D------ a beautifullittle town in East Anglia I first saw the light. My father aCornishman after serving many years in the Line at last entered ascaptain in a militia regiment. My mother a strikingly handsome womanwas of the Huguenot race. I was not the only child of my parents for Ihad a brother three years older than myself. He was a beautiful boy withmuch greater mental ability than I possessed and he with the greatestaffection indulged me in every possible way. Alas his was an early anda foreign graveI have been a wanderer the greater part of my life being the son of asoldier who unable to afford the support of two homes was accompaniedby his family wherever he went. A lover of books and of retired cornersI was as a child in the habit of fleeing from society. The first bookthat fascinated me was one of Defoe's. But those early days werestirring times for England was then engaged in the struggle withNapoleon.I remember strange sights such as the scenes at Norman Cross a stationor prison where some six thousand French prisoners were immured. Andvividly impressed on my memory is my intercourse with an extraordinaryold man a snake-catcher who thrilled me with the recitals of hisexperiences. He declared that the vipers had a king a terriblecreature which he had encountered and from which he had managed toescape. After telling me that strange story of the king of the vipershe gave me a viper which he had tamed and had rendered harmless byextracting its fangs. I fed it with milk and frequently carried itabroad with me in my walks.One day on my rambles I entered a green lane I had never seen before.Seeing an odd-looking low tent or booth I advanced towards it. Besideit were two light carts and near by two or three lean ponies cropped
comment203,the grass. Suddenly the two inmates a man and a woman both wild andforbidding figures rushed out alarmed at my presence and commencedabusing me as an intruder. They threatened to fling me into the pondover the hedge.I defied them to touch me and as I did so made a motion wellunderstood by the viper that lay hid in my bosom. The reptile instantlylifted its head and stared at my enemies with its glittering eyes. Thewoman in amazed terror retreated to the tent and the man stood likeone transfixed. Presently the two commenced talking to each other inwhat to me sounded like French and next in a conciliating tone theyoffered me a peculiar sweetmeat which I accepted. A peaceableconversation ensued during which they cordially invited me to jointheir party and to become one of them.The interview was rudely interrupted. Hoofs were heard and the nextmoment a man rode up and addressed words to the gipsies which produced astartling effect. In a few minutes from different directions cameswarthy men and women. Hastily they harnessed the ponies and took downthe tent and packed the carts and in a remarkably brief space of timethe party rode off with the utmost speed.Three years passed during which I increased considerably in stature andstrength and let us hope improved in mind. For at school I had learntthe whole of Lilly's "Latin Grammar" but I was very ignorant offigures. Our regiment was moved to Edinburgh where the castle was agarrison for soldiers. In that city I and my brother were sent to thehigh school. Here the scholars were constantly fighting though no greatharm was done. I had seen deaths happen through fights at school inEngland.I became a daring cragsman a character to which an English lad canseldom aspire for in England there are neither crags nor mountains. TheScots are expert climbers and I was now a Scot in most thingsparticularly the language. The castle in which I dwelt stood on a craggyrock to scale which was my favourite diversion.In the autumn of 1815 when the war with Napoleon was ended we wereordered to Ireland where at school I read Latin and Greek with a niceold clergyman and of an evening studied French and Italian with abanished priest Italian being my favourite.It was in a horse fair I came across Jasper Petulengro a young gipsy ofwhom I had caught sight in the gipsy camp I have already alluded to. Hewas amazed to see me and in the most effusively friendly way claimed meas a "pal" calling me Sapengro or "snake-master" in allusion hesaid to the viper incident. He said he was also called Pharaoh and wasthe horse-master of the camp.From this time I had frequent interviews with Jasper. He taught me muchRomany and introduced me to Tawno Chikno the biggest man of the gipsynation and to Mrs. Chikno. These stood to him as parents for his ownwere banished. I soon found that in the tents I had become acquaintedwith a most interesting people. With their language I was fascinatedthough at first I had taken it for mere gibberish. My rapid progressastonished and delighted Jasper. "We'll no longer call you Sapengrobrother" said he "but Lavengro which in the language of the gorgiosmeaneth word-master." And Jasper's wife actually proposed that I shouldmarry her sister.The gipsies departed for England. I was now sixteen and continued in
comment204,the house of my parents passing my time chiefly in philologicalpursuits. But it was high time that I should adopt some profession. Myfather would gladly have seen me enter the Church but feared I was tooerratic. So I was put to the law but while remaining a novice at thatpursuit I became a perfect master of the Welsh language. My father soonbegan to feel that he had made a mistake in the choice of a professionfor me.My elder brother who had cultivated a great taste for painting told meone evening that father had given him 150 and his blessing and that hewas going to London to improve himself in his art.My father was taken ill with severe attacks of gout and in a touchingconversation assured me that his end was approaching. Before that sadevent happened my brother whom he longed to see arrived home. Myfather died with the name of Christ on his lips. The brave old soldierduring intervals between his attacks had told me more of his life thanI had ever learned before and I was amazed to find how much he knew andhad seen. He had talked with King George and had known Wellington andwas the friend of Townshend who when Wolfe fell led the Britishgrenadiers against the shrinking regiments of Montcalm._II.--An Adventure with a Publisher_One damp misty March morning I dismounted from the top of a coach inthe yard of a London inn. Delivering my scanty baggage to a porter Ifollowed him to a lodging prepared for me by an acquaintance. Itconsisted of a small room in which I was to sit and a smaller one stillin which I was to sleep.Having breakfasted comfortably by a good fire I sallied forth andeasily found my way to the place I was in quest of for it was scarcelyten minutes' walk distant. I was cordially received by the big man towhom some of my productions had been sent by a kind friend and to whomhe had given me a letter of introduction which was respectfully read.But he informed me that he was selling his publishing business and socould not make use of my literary help. He gave me counsel howeverespecially advising me to write some evangelical tales in the style ofthe "Dairyman's Daughter." As I told him I had never heard of that workhe said "Then sir procure it by all means." Much more conversationensued during which the publisher told me that he purposed continuingto issue once a month his magazine the "Oxford Review" and to this heproposed that I should attempt to contribute. As I was going away heinvited me to dine with him on the ensuing Sunday.On Sunday I was punctual to my appointment with the publisher. I foundthat for twenty years he had taken no animal food and no wine. Aftersome talk he requested me to compile six volumes of Newgate lives andtrials of a thousand pages each the remuneration to be 50 at thecompletion of the work. I was also to make myself generally useful tothe "Review" and furthermore to translate into German a book ofphilosophy which he had written. Then he dismissed me saying thatthough he never went to church he spent much of every Sunday afternoon
comment205,alone musing on the magnificence of Nature and the moral dignity ofman.I compiled the "Chronicles of Newgate" reviewed books for the "Review"and occasionally tried my best to translate into German portions of thepublisher's philosophy. But the "Review" did not prove a successfulspeculation and with its decease its corps of writers broke up. I waspaid not in cash but in bills one payable at twelve the other ateighteen months after date. It was a long time before I could turn thesebills to any account. At last I found a person willing to cash them at adiscount of only thirty per cent.By the month of October I had accomplished about two-thirds of thecompilation of the Newgate lives and had also made some progress withthe German translation. But about this time I had begun to see veryclearly that it was impossible that our connection would be of longduration yet in the event of my leaving the big man what had I tooffer another publisher I returned to my labour finished the Germantranslation got paid in the usual style and left that employer._III.--The Spirit of Stonehenge_One morning I discovered that my whole worldly wealth was reduced to asingle half-crown and throughout that day I walked about inconsiderable distress of mind. By a most singular chance I again cameacross my friend Petulengro in a fair into which I happened to wanderwhen walking by the side of the river beyond London. My gipsy friend wasseated with several men carousing beside a small cask. He sprang upgreeting me cordially and we chatted in Romany as we walked abouttogether. Questioning me closely he soon discovered that by that time Ihad only eighteen pence in my pocket.Said Jasper "I too have been in the big city but I have not beenwriting books. I have fought in the ring. I have fifty pounds in mypocket and I have much more in the world. Brother there isconsiderable difference between us." But he could not prevail on me toaccept or to borrow money for I said that if I could not earn I wouldstarve. "Come and stay with us" said he. "Our tents and horses are onthe other side of yonder wooded hill. We shall all be glad of your
comment206,company especially myself and my wife Pakomovna."I declined the kind invitation and walked on. Returning to the greatcity I suddenly found myself outside the shop of a publisher to whom Ihad vainly applied some time before in the hope of selling some of mywritings. As I looked listlessly at the window I observed a paperaffixed to the glass on which was written in a fair round hand "ANovel or Tale is much wanted." I at once resolved to go to work toproduce what was thus solicited. But what should the tale be aboutAfter cogitating at my lodging with bread and water before me Iconcluded that I would write an entirely fictitious narrative called"The Life and Adventures of Joseph Sell the Great Traveller." ThisJoseph Sell was an imaginary personage who had come into my head.I seized pen and paper but soon gave up the task of outlining thestory for the scenes flitted in bewildering fashion before myimagination. Yet before morning as I lay long awake I had sketchedthe whole work on the tablets of my mind. Next day I partook of breadand water and before night had completed pages of Joseph Sell andadded pages in varying quantity day by day until my enterprise wasfinished."To-morrow for the bookseller Oh me" I exclaimed as I lay down torest.On arriving at the shop I saw to my delight that the paper was still inthe window. As I entered a ladylike woman of about thirty came from theback parlour to ask my business. After my explanation she requested meas her husband was out to leave the MS. with her and to call again thenext day at eleven. At that hour I duly appeared and was greeted with acordial reception. "I think your book will do" said the bookseller.After some negotiation I was paid 20 on the spot and departed with alight heart. Reader amidst life's difficulties should you ever betempted to despair call to mind these experiences of Lavengro. Thereare few positions however difficult from which dogged resolution andperseverance will not liberate you.I had long determined to leave London as my health had become muchimpaired. My preparations were soon made and I set out to travel onfoot. In about two hours I had cleared the great city and was in abroad and excellent road leading I knew not whither. In the eveningfeeling weary I thought of putting up at an inn but was induced totake a seat in a coach paying sixteen shillings for the fare. At dawnof day I was roused from a broken slumber and bidden to alight andfound myself close to a moorland. Walking on and on I at length reacheda circle of colossal stones.The spirit of Stonehenge was upon me. As I reclined under the greattransverse stone in the middle of the gateway of giants I heard thetinkling of bells and presently a large flock of sheep came browsingalong and several entered the circle. Soon a man also came up. In afriendly talk the young shepherd told me that the people of the plainbelieved that thousands of men had brought the stones from Ireland tomake a temple in which to worship God.
comment207,"But" said I "our forefathers slaughtered the men who raised thestones and left not one stone on another.""Yes they did" said the shepherd looking aloft at the greattransverse stone."And it is well that they did" answered I "for whenever that stonewhich English hands never raised is by English hands thrown down woeto the English race. Spare it English. Hengist spared it."We parted and I wandered off to Salisbury the city of the spire. ThereI stayed two days spending my time as best I could and then walkedforth for several days during which nothing happened worthy of noticebut the weather was brilliant and my health had greatly improved.Coming one day to a small countryside cottage I saw scrawled over thedoor "Good beer sold here." Being overcome with thirst I went in totaste the beverage. Along the wall opposite where I sat in thewell-sanded kitchen was the most disconsolate family I had ever seenconsisting of a tinker his wife a pretty-looking woman who hadevidently been crying and a ragged boy and girl. I treated them to alarge measure of beer and in a few minutes the tinker was telling mehis history. That conversation ended very curiously for I purchased forfive pounds ten shillings the man's whole equipment. It included hisstock-in-trade and his pony and cart. Of the landlady I purchasedsundry provisions and also a waggoner's frock gave the horse a littlefeed of corn and departed._IV.--The Flaming Tinman_At three hours past noon I thus started to travel as a tinker. I wasabsolutely indifferent as to the direction of my journey. Coming to nohostelry I pitched my little tent after nightfall in a waste landamongst some bushes and kindled a fire in a convenient spot with stickswhich I gathered. For a few days I practiced my new craft by trying tomend two kettles and a frying-pan remaining in my little camp. Few folkpassed by. But soon some exciting incidents happened. My quarters wereone morning suddenly invaded by a young Romany girl who advancedtowards me after closely scanning me singing a gipsy song    The Romany chi    And the Romany chal    Shall jaw tasaulor    To drab the bawlor    And dook the gry    Of the farming rye.A very pretty song thought I falling hard to work again on my kettlea very pretty song which bodes the farmers much good. Let them look totheir cattle."All alone here brother" said a voice close to me in sharp but notdisagreeable tones.A talk ensued in which the girl discovered that I knew how to speakRomany and it ended in my presenting her with the kettle."Parraco tute--that is I thank you brother. The rikkeni kekaubi is nowmine. O rare I thank you kindly brother"Presently she came towards me stared me full in the face saying toherself "Grey tall and talks Romany" In her countenance there was anexpression I had not seen before which struck me as being composed offear curiosity and deepest hate. It was only momentary and wassucceeded by one smiling frank and open. "Good-bye tall brother"said she and she departed singing the same song.On the evening of the next day after I had been with my pony and cartstrolling through several villages and had succeeded in collectingseveral kettles which I was to mend I returned to my little camp litmy fire and ate my frugal meal. Then after looking for some time atthe stars I entered my tent lay down on my pallet and went to sleep.Two more days passed without momentous incidents but on the thirdevening the girl reappeared bringing me two cakes one of which sheoffered to eat herself if I would eat the other. They were the gift tome of her grandmother as a token of friendship. Incautiously I ate aportion to please the maiden. She eagerly watched as I did so. But I
comment208,paid dearly indeed for my simplicity. I was in a short time seized withthe most painful sensations and was speedily prostrate in helplessagonies.While I was in this alarming condition the grandmother appeared andbegan to taunt me with the utmost malignity. She was Mrs. Herne "thehairy one" who had conceived inveterate spite against me at the timewhen Petulengro had proposed that I should marry his wife's sister. Thispoison had been administered to inflict on me the vengeance she had notceased to meditate.My life was in real peril but I was fortunately delivered by a timelyand providential interposition. The malignant old gipsy woman and hergranddaughter were scared as they watched my sufferings by hearing thesound of travellers approaching. Two wayfarers came along one of whomhappened to be a kind and skillful doctor. He saved my life by drasticremedies.The next that I heard of Mrs. Herne was as Petulengro told me when weagain met that she had hanged herself the girl finding her suspendedfrom a tree. That announcement was accompanied by an unexpectedchallenge from my friend Jasper to fight him. He declared that as shewas his relative and I had been the cause of her destruction there wasno escape from the necessity of fighting. My plea that there was noinclination on my part for such a combat was of no avail. Accordingly wefought for half an hour when suddenly Petulengro exclaimed "Brotherthere is much blood on your face I think enough has been done in theaffair of the old woman."So the struggle ended and my Romany friend once more pressed me to joinhis tribe in their camp and in their life. I declined the offer for Ihad resolved to practice yet another calling the trade of a blacksmith.I could do so for amongst the stock-in-trade I had purchased from thetinker was a small forge with an anvil and hammers.It has always struck me that there is something poetical about a forge.I believe that the life of any blacksmith especially a rural one wouldafford material for a highly poetical treatise. But a rude stop was putto my dream. One morning a brutal-looking ruffian whom I had metbefore and recognised as a character known as the Flaming Tinman
comment209,appeared on the scene accusing me with fearful oaths of trespassing onhis ground. After volleys of abuse he attacked me and a fearful fightensued in which he was not the victor for in one of his terrificlunges he slipped and a blow which I was aiming happened to strike himbehind the ear. He fell senseless. Two women were with him one avulgar coarse creature his wife the other a tall fine young womanwho travelled with them for company doing business of her own with adonkey and cart selling merchandise.While I was bringing water from a spring in order to seek to revive theFlaming Tinman his wife and the young woman violently quarrelled forthe latter took my part vehemently. When at length my enemy recoveredsufficiently to look about him and then to stand up I found that hiswife had put an open knife in his hand. But his intention could not becarried out for his right hand was injured in the fight and was forthe time useless as he quickly realised.The couple presently departed cursing me and the young woman whoremained behind in the little camp and as I was in an exhausted stateoffered to make tea by the camp fire. While we were taking the repastshe told me the story of her life. Her name was Isopel Berners andthough she believed that she had come of a good stock she was born in aworkhouse. When old enough she had entered the service of a kind widowwho travelled with small merchandise. After the death of her mistressIsopel carried on the same avocation. Being friendless and falling inwith the Flaming Tinman and his wife she had associated with them yetacknowledged that she had found them to be bad people.Time passed on. Isopel and I lived still in the dingle occupying ourseparate tents. She went to and fro on her business and I went on shortexcursions. Her company when she happened to be in camp was veryentertaining for she had wandered in all parts of England and Wales.For recreation I taught her a great deal of Armenian much of which waslike the gipsy tongue. She had a kind heart and was an uprightcharacter. She often asked me questions about America for she had anidea she would like to go there. But as I had never crossed the sea tothat country I could only tell her what I had heard about it.                                     The Romany Rye      In this work published in two volumes in 1857 George Borrow     continued the "kind of biography in the Robinson Crusoe style"     which he had begun in the three volumes of "Lavengro" issued     six years earlier. "Romany Rye" is described as a sequel to     "Lavengro" and takes up that story with the author and his     friend Isopel Berners encamped side by side in the Mumpers'     Dingle whither the gipsies Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro and their     relations shortly afterwards arrive. The book consists of a     succession of episodes without plot the sole connecting     thread being Borrow's personality as figuring in them. Much of     the "Romany Rye" was written at Oulton Broad where after his     marriage in 1840 Borrow lived until he removed to Hereford     Square Brompton. At Oulton it is worthy of record gipsies     were allowed to pitch their tents the author of "Romany Rye"     and "Lavengro" mingling freely with them. As a novel the     "Romany Rye" is preferred by many readers to any of Borrow's     other works._I.--The Roving Life_It was as usual a brilliant morning the dewy blades of the rye-grasswhich covered the plain sparkled brightly in the beams of the sun whichhad probably been about two hours above the horizon. Near the mouth ofthe dingle--Mumpers' Dingle near Wittenhall Staffordshire--where myfriend Isopel Berners and I the travelling tinker were encamped sideby side a rather numerous body of my ancient friends and alliesoccupied the ground. About five yards on the right Mr. Petulengro wasbusily employed in erecting his tent he held in his hand an iron barsharp at the bottom with a kind of arm projecting from the top for the
comment210,purpose of supporting a kettle or cauldron over the fire. With the sharpend of this he was making holes in the earth at about twenty inchesdistance from each other into which he inserted certain long rods witha considerable bend towards the top which constituted the timbers ofthe tent and the supporters of the canvas. Mrs. Petulengro and a femalewith a crutch in her hand whom I recognised as Mrs. Chikno sat nearhim on the ground."Here we are brother" said Mr. Petulengro. "Here we are and plenty ofus.""I am glad to see you all" said I "and particularly you madam" saidI making a bow to Mrs. Petulengro "and you also madam" taking off myhat to Mrs. Chikno."Good-day to you sir" said Mrs. Petulengro. "You look as usualcharmingly and speak so too you have not forgot your manners.""It is not all gold that glitters" said Mrs. Chikno. "Howevergood-morrow to you young rye.""I am come on an errand" said I. "Isopel Berners down in the dellthere requests the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro's company atbreakfast. She will be happy also to see you madam" said I addressingMrs. Chikno."Is that young female your wife young man" said Mrs. Chikno."My wife" said I."Yes young man your wife--your lawful certificated wife""No" said I. "She is not my wife.""Then I will not visit with her" said Mrs. Chikno. "I countenancenothing in the roving line.""What do you mean by the roving line" I demanded."What do I mean by the roving line Why by it I mean such conduct as isnot tatcheno. When ryes and rawnies lives together in dingles withoutbeing certificated I call such behaviour being tolerably deep in theroving line everything savouring of which I am determined not tosanctify. I have suffered too much by my own certificated husband'soutbreaks in that line to afford anything of the kind the slightestshadow of countenance.""It is hard that people may not live in dingles together without beingsuspected of doing wrong" said I."So it is" said Mrs. Petulengro interposing. "I am suspicious ofnobody not even of my own husband whom some people would think I havea right to be suspicious of seeing that on his account I once refused alord. I always allows him an agreeable latitude to go where he pleases.But I have had the advantage of keeping good company and therefore----""Meklis" said Mrs. Chikno "pray drop all that sister I believe I
comment211,have kept as good company as yourself and with respect to that offerwith which you frequently fatigue those who keeps company with you Ibelieve after all it was something in the roving and uncertificatedline."_II.--The Parting of the Ways_Belle was sitting before the fire at which the kettle was boiling."Were you waiting for me" I inquired."Yes" said Belle."That was very kind" said I."Not half so kind" said she "as it was of you to get everything readyfor me in the dead of last night."After tea we resumed our study of Armenian. "First of all tell me"said Belle "what a verb is""A part of speech" said I "which according to the dictionarysignifies some action or passion. For example I command you or I hateyou.""I have given you no cause to hate me" said Belle looking mesorrowfully in the face."I was merely giving two examples" said I. "In Armenian there are fourconjugations of verbs the first ends in al the second in yel thethird in oul and the fourth in il. Now have you understood me""I am afraid indeed it will all end ill" said Belle."Let us have no unprofitable interruptions" said I. "Come we willbegin with the verb hntal a verb of the first conjugation whichsignifies rejoice. Come along. Hntam I rejoice hntas thou rejoicest.Why don't you follow Belle""I'm sure I don't rejoice whatever you may do" said Belle."The chief difficulty Belle" said I "that I find in teaching you theArmenian grammar proceeds from your applying to yourself and me everyexample I give.""I can't bear this much longer" said Belle."Keep yourself quiet" said I. "We will skip hntal and proceed to thesecond conjugation. Belle I will now select for you to conjugate theprettiest verb in Armenian--the verb siriel. Here is the present tensesiriem siries sir siriemk sirk sirien. Come on Belle and say'siriem.'"Belle hesitated. "You must admit Belle it is much softer than hntam.""It is so" said Belle "and to oblige you I will say 'siriem.'""Very well indeed Belle" said I. "And now to show you how verbs actupon pronouns I will say 'siriem zkiez.' Please to repeat 'siriemzkiez.'""'Siriem zkiez'" said Belle. "That last word is very hard to say.""Sorry that you think so Belle" said I. "Now please to say 'siriazis.'" Belle did so."Now say 'yerani th sirir zis'" said I."'Yerani th sirir zis'" said Belle."Capital" said I. "You have now said 'I love you--love me--ah wouldthat you would love me'""And I have said all these things""You have said them in Armenian" said I."I would have said them in no language that I understood and it wasvery wrong of you to take advantage of my ignorance and make me say suchthings.""Why so" said I. "If you said them I said them too.""You did so" said Belle "but I believe you were merely bantering andjeering.""As I told you before Belle" said I "the chief difficulty which Ifind in teaching you Armenian proceeds from your persisting in applyingto yourself and me every example I give.""Then you meant nothing after all" said Belle raising her voice."Let us proceed sirietsi I loved.""You never loved anyone but yourself" said Belle "and what's more----""Sirietsits I will love" said I "sirietsies thou wilt love.""Never one so thoroughly heartless.""I tell you what Belle--you are becoming intolerable. But we willchange the verb. You would hardly believe Belle" said I "that theArmenian is in some respects closely connected with the Irish but so itis. For example that word parghatsoutsaniem is evidently derived fromthe same root as fear-gaim which in Irish is as much as to say 'Ivex.'""You do indeed" said Belle sobbing."But how do you account for it""Oh man man" cried Belle bursting into tears "for what purpose doyou ask a poor ignorant girl such a question unless it be to vex andirritate her If you wish to display your learning do so to the wiseand instructed and not to me who can scarcely read or write.""I am sorry to see you take on so dear Belle" said I. "I had no ideaof making you cry. Come I beg your pardon what more can I do Comecheer up Belle. You were talking of parting don't let us part but
comment212,depart and that together.""Our ways lie different" said Belle."I don't see why they should" said I. "Come let us be off to Americatogether.""To America together" said Belle."Yes" said I "where we will settle down in some forest and conjugatethe verb siriel conjugally.""Conjugally" said Belle."Yes as man and wife in America.""You are jesting as usual" said Belle."Not I indeed. Come Belle make up your mind and let us be off toAmerica.""I don't think you are jesting" said Belle "but I can hardly entertainyour offers however young man I thank you. I will say nothing more atpresent. I must have time to consider."Next day when I got up to go with Mr. Petulengro to the fair onleaving my tent I observed Belle entirely dressed standing close toher own little encampment."Dear me" said I. "I little expected to find you up so early.""I merely lay down in my things" said Belle "I wished to be inreadiness to bid you farewell when you departed.""Well God bless you Belle" said I. "I shall be home to-night bywhich time I expect you will have made up your mind."On arriving at the extremity of the plain I looked towards the dingle.Isopel Berners stood at the mouth the beams of the early morning sunshone full on her noble face and figure. I waved my hand towards her.She slowly lifted up her right arm. I turned away and never saw IsopelBerners again.The fourth morning afterwards I received from her a letter in which shesent me a lock of her hair and told me she was just embarking for adistant country never expecting to see her own again. She concludedwith this piece of advice "_Fear God_ and take your own part. FearGod young man and never give in The world can bully and is fond ifit sees a man in a kind of difficulty of getting about him calling himcoarse names but no sooner sees the man taking off his coat andoffering to fight than it scatters and is always civil to himafterwards."_III.--Horse-Keeping and Horse-Dealing_After thus losing Isopel I decided to leave the dingle and having byMr. Petulengro's kind advice become the possessor of a fine horse Igave my pony and tinker's outfit to the gipsies and set out on theroad whereupon I was to meet with strange adventures.At length awaiting the time when I could take my horse to HorncastleFair and sell him I settled at a busy inn on the high-road where inreturn for board and lodging for myself and horse I had to supervisethe distribution of hay and corn in the stables and to keep an account
comment213,thereof. The old ostler with whom I was soon on excellent terms was aregular character--a Yorkshireman by birth who had seen a great deal oflife in the vicinity of London. He had served as ostler at a small innat Hounslow much frequented by highway men. Jerry Abershaw and RichardFerguson generally called Galloping Dick were capital customers thenhe told me and he had frequently drunk with them in the corn-room. Noman could desire jollier companions over a glass of "summut" but on theroad they were terrible cursing and swearing and thrusting the muzzlesof their pistols into people's mouths.From the old ostler I picked up many valuable hints about horses."When you are a gentleman" said he "should you ever wish to take ajourney on a horse of your own follow my advice. Before you startmerely give your horse a couple of handfuls of corn and a littlewater--somewhat under a quart. Then you may walk and trot for about tenmiles till you come to some nice inn where you see your horse led intoa nice stall telling the ostler not to feed him till you come. If theostler happens to have a dog say what a nice one it is if he hasn'task him how he's getting on and whether he ever knew worse times whenyour back's turned he'll say what a nice gentleman you are and how hethinks he has seen you before."Then go and sit down to breakfast and before you have finished get upand go and give your horse a feed of corn chat with the ostler two orthree minutes till your horse has taken the shine out of his corn whichwill prevent the ostler taking any of it away when your back's turned.Then go and finish your breakfast and when you have finished yourbreakfast when you have called for the newspaper go and water yourhorse letting him have about one pailful then give him another feed ofcorn and enter into discourse with the ostler about bull-baiting theprime minister and the like and when your horse has once more takenthe shine out of his corn go back to your room and your newspaper. Thenpull the bell-rope and order in your bill which you will pay withoutcounting it up--supposing you to be a gentleman. Give the waitersixpence and order out your horse and when your horse is out pay forthe corn and give the ostler a shilling then mount your horse and walkhim gently for five miles."See to your horse at night and have him well rubbed down. Next dayyou may ride your horse forty miles just as you please and those willbring you to your journey's end unless it's a plaguey long one. If sonever ride your horse more than five-and-thirty miles a day alwaysseeing him well fed and taking more care of him than yourself seeingas how he is the best animal of the two."The stage-coachmen of that time--low fellows but masters of driving--were made so much fuss of by sprigs of nobility and others that theirbrutality and rapacious insolence had reached a climax. One whofrequented our inn and who was called the "bang-up coachman" was aswaggering bully who not only lashed his horses unmercifully but in
comment214,one or two instances had beaten in a barbarous manner individuals whohad quarrelled with him. One day an inoffensive old fellow of sixty whorefused him a tip for his insolence was lighting his pipe when thecoachman struck it out of his mouth.The elderly individual without manifesting much surprise said "Ithank you and if you will wait a minute I'll give you a receipt forthat favour." Then gathering up his pipe and taking off his coat andhat he advanced towards the coachman holding his hands crossed verynear his face.The coachman who expected anything but such a movement pointed at himderisively with his finger. The next moment however the other hadstruck aside the hand with his left fist and given him a severe blow onthe nose with his right which he immediately followed by a left-handblow in the eye. The coachman endeavoured to close but his foe was notto be closed with he did not shift or dodge about but warded off theblows of his opponent with the greatest _sangfroid_ always using thesame guard and putting in short chopping blows with the quickness oflightning. In a very few minutes the coachman was literally cut topieces. He did not appear on the box again for a week and never held uphis head afterwards.Reaching Horncastle at last I managed to get quarters for myself andhorse and by making friends with the ostlers and others picked upmore hints."There a'n't a better horse in the fair" said one companion to me "andas you are one of us and appear to be all right I'll give you a pieceof advice--don't take less than a hundred and fifty for him.""Well" said I "thank you for your advice and if successful I willgive you 'summut' handsome.""Thank you" said the ostler "and now let me ask whether you are up toall the ways of this here place""I've never been here before" said I.Thereupon he gave me half a dozen cautions one of which was not to stopand listen to what any chance customer might have to say and anotherby no manner of means to permit a Yorkshireman to get up into thesaddle. "For" said he "if you do it is three to one that he rides offwith the horse he can't help it. Trust a cat amongst cream but nevertrust a Yorkshireman on the saddle of a good horse.""A fine horse A capital horse" said several of the connoisseurs. "Whatdo you ask for him""A hundred and fifty pounds" said I."Why I thought you would have asked double that amount You do yourselfinjustice young man.""Perhaps I do" said I "but that's my affair. I do not choose to takemore.""I wish you would let me get into the saddle" said the man. "The horseknows you and therefore shows to more advantage but I should like tosee how he would move under me who am a stranger. Will you let me getinto the saddle young man""No" said I."Why not" said the man."Lest you should be a Yorkshireman" said I "and should run away withthe horse.""Yorkshire" said the man. "I am from Suffolk--silly Suffolk--so youneed not be afraid of my running away with him.""Oh if that's the case" said I "I should be afraid that the horsewould run away with you"Threading my way as well as I could through the press I returned to theyard of the inn where dismounting I stood still holding the horse bythe bridle. A jockey who had already bargained with me enteredaccompanied by another individual."Here is my lord come to look at the horse young man" said the jockey.My lord was a tall figure of about five-and-thirty. He had on his head a
comment215,hat somewhat rusty and on his back a surtout of blue rather worse forwear. His forehead if not high was exceedingly narrow his eyes werebrown with a rat-like glare in them. He had scarcely glanced at thehorse when drawing in his cheeks he thrust out his lips like a baboonto a piece of sugar."Is this horse yours" said he."It's my horse" said I. "Are you the person who wishes to make anhonest penny by it" alluding to a phrase of the jockey's."How" said he drawing up his head with a very consequential look andspeaking with a very haughty tone. "What do you mean" We looked at eachother full in the face. "My agent here informs me that you ask onehundred and fifty pounds which I cannot think of giving. The horse is ashowy horse. But look my dear sir he has a defect here and in hisnear foreleg I observe something which looks very much like a splintYes upon my credit he has a splint or something which will end inone A hundred and fifty pounds sir What could have induced you to askanything like that for this animal I protest--Who are you sir I am intreaty for this horse" said he turning to a man who had come up whilsthe was talking and was now looking into the horse's mouth."Who am I" said the man still looking into the horse's mouth. "Who amI his lordship asks me. Ah I see close on five" said he releasingthe horse's jaws.Close beside him stood a tall youth in a handsome riding dress andwearing a singular green hat with a high peak."What do you ask for him" said the man."A hundred and fifty" said I."I shouldn't mind giving it to you" said he."You will do no such thing" said his lordship. "Sir" said he to me "Imust give you what you ask.""No" said I "had you come forward in a manly and gentlemanly manner topurchase the horse I should have been happy to sell him to you butafter all the fault you have found with him I would not sell him to youat any price."His lordship after a contemptuous look at me and a scowl at the jockeystalked out."And now" said the other "I suppose I may consider myself as thepurchaser of this here animal for this young gentleman""By no means" said I. "I am utterly unacquainted with either of you.""Oh I have plenty of vouchers for my respectability" said he. Andthrusting his hand into his bosom he drew out a bundle of notes. "Theseare the kind of things which vouch best for a man's respectability.""Not always" said I "sometimes these kind of things need vouchers forthemselves." The man looked at me with a peculiar look. "Do you mean tosay that these notes are not sufficient notes" said he "because ifyou do I shall take the liberty of thinking that you are not overcivil and when I thinks a person is not over and above civil Isometimes takes off my coat and when my coat is off----""You sometimes knock people down" I added. "Well whether you knock medown or not I beg leave to tell you that I am a stranger in this fairand shall part with the horse to nobody who has no better guarantee for
comment216,his respectability than a roll of bank-notes which may be good or notfor what I know who am not a judge of such things.""Oh if you are a stranger here" said the man "you are quite right tobe cautious queer things being done in this fair. But I suppose if thelandlord of the house vouches for me and my notes you will have noobjection to part with the horse to me""None whatever" said I.Thereupon I delivered the horse to my friend the ostler. The landlordinformed me that my new acquaintance was a respectable horse-dealer andan intimate friend of his whereupon the purchase was soon brought to asatisfactory conclusion._IV.--A Recruiting Sergeant_Leaving Horncastle the next day I bent my steps eastward and on thefollowing day I reached a large town situated on a river. At the end ofthe town I was accosted by a fiery-faced individual dressed as arecruiting sergeant."Young man you are just the kind of person to serve the Honourable EastIndia Company.""I had rather the Honourable Company should serve me" said I."Of course young man. Take this shilling 'tis service money. TheHonourable Company engages to serve you and you the HonourableCompany.""And what must I do for the Company""Only go to India--the finest country in the world. Rivers bigger thanthe Ouse. Hills higher than anything near Spalding. Trees--you never sawsuch trees Fruits--you never saw such fruits""And the people--what kind are they""Pah Kauloes--blacks--a set of rascals And they calls us lolloeswhich in their beastly gibberish means reds. Why do you stare so""Why" said I "this is the very language of Mr. Petulengro.""I say young fellow I don't like your way of speaking you are madsir. You won't do for the Honourable Company. Good-day to you""I shouldn't wonder" said I as I proceeded rapidly eastward "if Mr.Petulengro came from India. I think I'll go there."                                   M. E. BRADDONLady Audley's Secret      Mary Elizabeth Maxwell youngest daughter of Henry Braddon     solicitor and widow of John Maxwell publisher was born in     London in 1837. Early in life she had literary aspirations     and as a girl of twenty-three wrote her first novel "The     Trail of the Serpent" which first appeared in serial form.     "Lady Audley's Secret" was published in 1862 and Miss Braddon     immediately sprang into fame as an authoress combining a     graphic style with keen analysis of character and exceptional     ingenuity in the construction of a plot of tantalising     complexities and DRAMATIC _DNOUEMENT_. The book passed     through many editions and there was an immediate demand for     other stories by the gifted authoress. That demand was met     with an industry and resource rarely equalled. Every year     since Miss Braddon who throughout retained her maiden as her     pen-name furnished the reading public with one and for a     long period two romances of absorbing interest._I.--The Second Lady Audley_SIR MICHAEL AUDLEY was fifty-six years of age and had married a secondwife nine months before. For seventeen years he had been a widower withan only child--Alicia now eighteen. Lady Audley had come into theneighbourhood from London in response to an advertisement in the"Times" as a governess in the family of Mr. Dawson the villagesurgeon. Her accomplishments were brilliant and numerous. Everyone highand low loved admired and praised her and united in declaring thatLucy Graham was the sweetest girl that ever lived. Sir Michael Audleyexpressed a strong desire to be acquainted with her. A meeting wasarranged at the surgeon's house and that day Sir Michael's fate wassealed. One misty June evening Sir Michael sitting opposite Lucy Grahamat the window of the surgeon's little drawing-room spoke to her on thesubject nearest his heart."I scarcely think" he said "there is a greater sin Lucy than that ofa woman who marries a man she does not love. You are so precious to methat deeply as my heart is set on this and bitter as the mere thoughtof disappointment is to me I would not have you commit such a sin forany happiness of mine. Nothing but misery can result from a marriage
comment217,dictated by any motive but truth and love."Lucy for some moments was quite silent. Then turning to him with asudden passion in her manner that lighted up her face with a new andwonderful beauty she fell on her knees at his feet. Clutching at ablack ribbon about her throat she exclaimed"How good how noble how generous you are But you ask too much of me.Only remember what my life has been From babyhood I have never seenanything but poverty. My father was a gentleman but poor my mother--but don't let me speak of her. You can never guess what is endured bygenteel paupers. I cannot be disinterested I cannot be blind to theadvantages of such a marriage. I do not dislike you--no no and I donot love anyone in the world" she added with a laugh when asked ifthere was anyone else.Sir Michael was silent for a few moments and then with a kind ofeffort said "Well Lucy I will not ask too much of you but I see noreason why we should not make a very happy couple."When Lucy went to her own room she sat down on the edge of the bed andmurmured "No more dependence no more drudgery no more humiliationsEvery trace of the old life melted away every clue to identity buriedand forgotten except this"--and she drew from her bosom a black ribbonand locket and the object attached to it. It was a ring wrapped in anoblong piece of crumpled paper partly written and partly printed._II.--The Return of the Gold-Seeker_A tall powerfully-built young man of twenty-five his face bronzed byexposure brown eyes bushy black beard moustache and hair was pacingimpatiently the deck of the Australian liner Argus bound from Melbourneto Liverpool. His name was George Talboys. He was joined in hispromenade by a shipboard-friend who had been attracted by the feverishardour and freshness of the young man and was made the confidant of hisstory."Do you know Miss Morley" he said "that I left my little girl asleepwith her baby in her arms and with nothing but a few blotted lines totell her why her adoring husband had deserted her.""Deserted her" cried Miss Morley."Yes. I was a cornet in a cavalry regiment when I first met my darling.We were quartered in a stupid seaport town where my pet lived with hershabby old father--a half-pay naval man. It was a case of love at first
comment218,sight on both sides and my darling and I made a match of it. My fatheris a rich man but no sooner did he hear that I was married to apenniless girl than he wrote a furious letter telling me that he wouldnever again hold any communication with me and that my yearly allowancewas stopped."I sold out my commission thinking that before the money I got for itwas exhausted I should be sure to drop into something. I took my darlingto Italy lived in splendid style and then when there was nothing leftbut a couple of hundred pounds we came back to England and boarded withmy wretched father-in-law who fleeced us finely. I went to London andtried in vain to get employment and on my return my little girl burstinto a storm of lamentations blaming me for the cruel wrong of marryingher if I could give her nothing but poverty and misery. Her tears andreproaches drove me almost mad. I ran out of the house rushed down tothe pier intending after dark to drop quietly into the water and endall."While I sat smoking two men came along and began to talk of theAustralian gold-diggings and the great fortunes that were to be madethere in a short time. I got into conversation with them and learnedthat a ship sailed from Liverpool for Melbourne in three days. Thethought flashed on me that that was better than the water. I returnedhome crept upstairs and wrote a few hurried lines which told her thatI never loved her better than now when I seemed to desert her that Iwas going to try my fortune in a new world that if I succeeded I shouldcome back to bring her plenty and happiness but if I failed I shouldnever look upon her face again. I kissed her hand and the baby once andslipped out of the room. Three nights after I was out at sea bound forMelbourne a steerage passenger with a digger's tools for my baggageand seven shillings in my pocket. After three and a half years of hardand bitter struggles on the goldfields at last I struck it richrealised twenty thousand pounds and a fortnight later I took my passagefor England. All this time I had never communicated with my wife butthe moment fortune came I wrote telling her I should be in Englandalmost as soon as my letter and giving her an address at a coffee-housein London."That same evening Phoebe Marks maid to Lady Audley invited her cousinand sweetheart Luke Marks a farm labourer with ambitions to own apublic-house to survey the wonders of Audley Court including my lady'sprivate apartments and her jewel-box. During the inspection byaccident a knob in the framework of the jewel-box was pushed and asecret drawer sprang out There were neither gold nor gems in it. Only ababy's little worsted shoe rolled in a piece of paper and a tiny lock
comment219,of silky yellow hair evidently taken from a baby's head. Phoebe's eyesdilated as she examined the little packet."So this is what my lady hides in the secret drawer" she said puttingthe little packet in her pocket."Why Phoebe you're never going to be such a fool as to take that"cried Luke."I'd rather have this than the diamond bracelet you would have liked totake" she said her lips curving into a curious smile. "You shall havethe public-house Luke."_III.--Robert Audley Comes on the Scene_Robert Audley was supposed to be a barrister and had chambers in FigTree Court Temple. He was a handsome lazy care-for-nothing fellow ofseven-and-twenty the only son of the younger brother of Sir MichaelAudley who had left him a moderate competency.One morning Robert Audley strolled out of the Temple Blackfriarswards.At the corner of a court in St. Paul's Churchyard he was almost knockeddown by a man of his own age dashing headlong into the narrow opening.Robert remonstrated the stranger stopped suddenly looked very hard atthe speaker and cried in a tone of intense astonishment"Bob I only touched British ground after dark last night and to thinkI should meet you this morning"George Talboys for the stranger was the late passenger on board theArgus had been from boyhood the inseparable chum of Robert Audley. Thetale of Talboys' marriage his expedition to Australia and his returnwith a fortune was briefly told. The pair took a hansom to theWestminster coffee-house where Talboys had written to his wife toforward letters. There was no letter and the young man showed verybitter disappointment. By and by George mechanically picked up a "Times"newspaper of a day or two before and stared vacantly at the first page.He turned a sickly colour and pointed to a line which ran "On the 24thinst. at Ventnor-Isle of Wight Helen Talboys aged 22." He knew nomore until he opened his eyes in a room in his friend's chambers in theTemple.Next day he and Robert Audley journeyed by express to Ventnor learnedon inquiry at the principal hotel that a Captain Maldon whose daughterwas lately dead was staying at Lansdowne Cottage and thither theyproceeded. The captain and his little grandson Georgey were out.George Talboys and his friend visited the churchyard where his wife wasburied commissioned a mason to erect a headstone on the grave and thenwent to the beach to seek Captain Maldon and the little boy.The captain when he saw his son-in-law coloured violently withsomething of a frightened look. He told Talboys that only a few monthsafter his departure he and Helen came to live at Southampton where shehad obtained a few pupils for the piano but her health failed and shefell into a decline of which she died. Broken-hearted Talboys startedfor Liverpool to take ship for Australia but failed to catch thesteamer returned to London and accompanied Robert Audley on a longvisit to Russia.A year passed and Robert proposed to take his friend to Audley Courtbut had a letter from his cousin Alicia saying that her stepmother hadtaken into her head that she was too ill to entertain though in realitythere was nothing the matter with her."My lady's airs and graces shan't keep us out of Essex for all that"said Robert Audley. "We will go to a comfortable old inn in the villageof Audley."Thither they went but Lady Audley who had casually seen him althoughhe was unaware of it continued on one excuse or another to avoidmeeting George Talboys. The two young men strolled up to the Court inthe absence of Sir Michael and Lady Audley where they met AliciaAudley who showed them the lime walk and the old well.
comment220,Robert was anxious to see the portrait of his new aunt but LadyAudley's picture was in her private apartments the door of which waslocked. Alicia remembered there was unknown to Lady Audley access tothese by means of a secret passage. In a spirit of fun the young menexplored the passage and reached the portrait. George Talboys sat beforeit without uttering a word only staring blankly."We managed it capitally but I don't like the portrait" said Robertwhen they had crept back. "There is something odd about it.""There is" answered Alicia. "We never have seen my lady look as shedoes in that picture but I think she could look so."Next day Talboys and Robert went fishing. George pretended to fishRobert slept on the river-bank. The servants were at dinner at theCourt Alicia had gone riding. Lady Audley sauntered out book in handto the shady lime walk. George Talboys came up to the hall rang thebell was told that her ladyship was walking in the lime avenue. Helooked disappointed at the intelligence and walked away. A full hourand a half later Lady Audley returned to the house not coming from thelime avenue but from the opposite direction. In her own room sheconfronted her maid Phoebe. The eyes of the two women met."Phoebe Marks" said my lady presently "you are a good girl and whileI live and am prosperous you shall not want a firm friend and atwenty-pound note."_IV.--The Search and the Counter Check_Robert Audley awoke from his nap to find George Talboys gone. Hesearched in the grounds and in the inn for him in vain. At therailway-station he heard that a man who from the description givenmight be Talboys had gone by the afternoon train to London. In theevening he went up to the Court to dinner. Lady Audley was gay andfascinating but gave a little nervous shudder when Robert feelinguneasy about his friend said so.Again when Lady Audley was at the piano he observed a bruise on herarm. She said that it was caused by tying a piece of ribbon too tightlyround her arm two or three days before. But Robert saw that the bruisewas recent and that it had been made by the four fingers one of whichhad a ring of a powerful hand.Suspicion began to be aroused in the mind of Robert Audley first as tothe real identity of Lady Audley and second as to the fate of hisfriend. He brought into play all the keenness of his intellect andabandoned his lazy habits. He went to Southampton saw Captain Maldonwho told him that George Talboys had arrived the morning before at oneo'clock to have a look at his boy before sailing for Australia. Oninquiry at Liverpool this proved to be false.He sought the assistance of George's father Squire Talboys at GrangeHeath Dorsetshire to discover the murderer but the squire resolutelyrefused to accept that his son was dead. He was only hiding hoping forforgiveness which would never be given.The beautiful sister of George Talboys followed Robert when he left themansion and besought him passionately to avenge her brother's murder inwhich she implicitly believed and this he promised to do.Then he learned that Phoebe Lady Audley's maid had married her cousinLuke Marks who under veiled threats had obtained one hundred poundsfrom her ladyship to enable him to lease the Castle Inn. And havingvisited the place and held conversation with the half-drunken landlordhe felt assured that Luke Marks and his wife had by some means obtaineda sinister power over Lady Audley.Robert thereafter traced the life history of Helen Maldon from hermarriage to George Talboys at Wildernsea Yorkshire her secretdeparture from there after her husband's desertion her appearance thefollowing day as a teacher in a girl's school at Brompton under the nameof Lucy Graham her arrival as a governess in Essex and finally hermarriage to Sir Michael Audley.Once more he returned to the Court where his uncle was lying illattended by Lady Audley. He demanded a private audience of my lady atwhich he told her he had discovered the whole of the conspiracyconcocted by an artful woman who had speculated upon the chance of her
comment221,husband's death and had secured a splendid position at the risk ofcommitting a crime."My friend George Talboys" said Robert "was last seen entering thesegardens and was never seen to leave them. I will have such a searchmade as shall level that house to the earth and root up every treerather than I will fail in finding the grave of my murdered friend.""You shall never live to do this" she said. "I will kill you first"That evening Lady Audley gave to her husband a gloss of what his nephewhad said and boldly accused him of being mad. "You would" she said"never let anyone influence you against me would you darling""No my love they had better not try it."Lady Audley laughed aloud with a gay triumphant peal as she trippedout of the room but as she sat in her own chamber brooding shemuttered "Dare I defy him Will anything stop him but--death"Just then Phoebe Marks arrived to warn Lady Audley that Robert hadappeared at the Castle Inn. She also explained that a bailiff was in thehouse as the rent was due and she wanted money to pay him out. LadyAudley insisted to Phoebe's astonishment that she herself would bringthe money. She did so and unknown to Phoebe cunningly set fire to theinn hoping that Robert Audley would meet his death. She and her maidthen left the inn to make the long tramp back to the Court. Half thedistance had been covered when Phoebe looked back and saw a red glarein the sky. She stopped suddenly fell on her knees and cried "Oh myGod Say it's not true It's too horrible""What's too horrible" said Lady Audley."The thought that is in my mind.""I will tell you nothing except that you are a mad woman and go home."Lady Audley walked away in the darkness._V.--My Lady Tells the Truth_Lady Audley next day was under the dominion of a terrible restlessness.Towards the dinner hour she walked in the quadrangle. In the dusk shelost all self-control when a figure approached. Her knees sank under herand she dropped to the ground. It was Robert Audley who helped her torise and then led her into the library. In a pitiless voice he calledher the incendiary of the fire at the inn. Fortunately he had changedhis room and escaped being burnt to death saving at the same timeLuke Marks. The day was now past he insisted for mercy after lastnight's deed of horror and she should no longer pollute the Court withher presence."Bring Sir Michael" she cried "and I will confess everything"And so the confession was made. Briefly stated it was that as a littlechild in a Hampshire coast village when she asked where her motherwas the answer always was that that was a secret. In a fit of passionthe foster-mother told her that her own mother was a madwoman in anasylum many miles away. Afterwards she learned that the madness was ahereditary disease and she was instructed to keep the secret because itmight affect her injuriously in after life. Then she detailed the storyof her life until her marriage with Sir Michael Audley justifying that
comment222,on the ground that she had a right to believe her first husband wasdead. In the sunshine of love at Audley Court she felt for the firsttime in her life the miseries of others and took pleasure in acts ofkindness.In an Essex paper she read of the return of her first husband toEngland. Knowing his character she thought that unless he could beinduced to believe she was dead he would never abandon his search forher. Again she became mad. In collusion with her father she induced aMrs. Plowson in Southampton who had a daughter in the last stage ofconsumption to pass off that daughter as Mrs. George Talboys andremoved her to Ventnor Isle of Wight with her own little boy schooledto call her "mamma." There she died in a fortnight was buried as Mrs.George Talboys and the advertisement of the death was inserted in the"Times" two days before her husband's arrival in England.Sir Michael could hear no more. He and his daughter Alicia departed thatevening for the Continent. Next day Dr. Mosgrave a mental specialistarrived from London. He was fully informed of the history of LadyAudley examined her and finally reported to Robert "The lady is notmad but she has a hereditary taint in her blood. She has the cunning ofmadness with the prudence of intelligence. She is dangerous." He gaveRobert a letter addressed to Monsieur Val Villebrumeuse Belgium whohe said was the proprietor and medical superintendent of an excellent_maison de sant_ and would no doubt willingly receive Lady Audleyinto his establishment and charge himself with the full responsibilityof her future life.Robert escorted Lady Audley to Villebrumeuse where she was presented toMonsieur Val as Madame Taylor. When Monsieur Val retired from thereception room at my lady's request she turned to Robert and said"You have brought me to a living grave you have used your power baselyand cruelly.""I have done that which I thought was just to others and merciful toyou" replied Robert. "Live here and repent.""I cannot" cried my lady. "I would defy you and kill myself if I dared.Do you know what I am thinking of It is of the day upon which GeorgeTalboys--disappeared The body of George Talboys lies at the bottom ofthe old well in the shrubbery beyond the lime walk. He came to me theregoaded me beyond endurance and I called him a madman and a liar. I wasgoing to leave him when he seized me by the wrist and sought to detainme by force. You yourself saw the bruises. I became mad and drew theloose iron spindle from the shrunken wood of the windlass. My firsthusband sank with one horrible cry into the black mouth of the well"_VI.--The Mystery Cleared Up_On arrival in London Robert Audley received a letter from Clara Talboyssaying that Luke Marks the man whom he had saved in the fire at theCastle Inn was lying at his mother's cottage at Audley and expressed avery earnest wish to see him. Robert took train at once to Audley.The dying man confessed that on the night of George Talboys'sdisappearance when going home to his mother's cottage he heard groans
comment223,come from the laurel bushes in the shrubbery near the old well. Onsearch he found Talboys covered with slime and with a broken arm. Hecarried the crippled man to his mother's cottage washed fed andnursed him.Next day Talboys gave him a five-pound note to accompany him to the townof Brentwood where he called on a surgeon to have his broken arm setand dressed. That done Talboys wrote two notes in pencil with his lefthand and gave them to Luke to deliver--one with a cross to be handed toLady Audley and the other to the nephew of Sir Michael and then tooktrain to London in a second-class carriage.Phoebe who had seen from her window Lady Audley pushing George Talboysinto the well said that my lady was in their power and that she woulddo anything for them to keep her secret. So the letters were notdelivered.He hid them away not a creature had seen them. The old mother who hadbeen present throughout the confession took the papers from a drawerand handed them to Robert Audley.The note to Robert said that something had happened to the writer hecould not tell what which drove him from England a broken-hearted manto seek some corner of the earth where he might live and die unknown andforgotten. He left his son in his friend's hands knowing that he couldleave him to no truer guardian. The second note was addressed "Helen"saying "May God pity and forgive you for that which you have doneto-day as truly as I do. Rest in peace. You shall never hear from meagain. I leave England never to return.--G. T."Luke Marks died that afternoon. Robert Audley wrote a long letter thesame evening addressed to Madame Taylor in which he told the storyrelated by Marks and as soon as possible he went down to Dorsetshire toinform George Talboys's father that his son was alive. He stayed fiveweeks at Grange Heath and the love which had come to him at first sightof Clara Talboys rapidly ripened.Consent to the marriage was given with a blessing by the oldRoman-minded squire and the pair agreed to go on their honeymoon tripto Australia to look for the son and brother. Robert returned for thelast time to his bachelor chambers in the Temple. He was told that avisitor was waiting for him. The visitor was George Talboys and heopened his arms to his lost friend with a cry of delight and surprise.The tale was soon told. When George fell into the well he was stunnedand bruised and his arm broken. After infinite pains and difficulties
comment224,he climbed to the top and hid in a clump of laurel bushes till thearrival of Luke Marks. He had not been to Australia after all but hadexchanged his berth on board the Victoria Regia for another in a shipbound for New York. There he remained for a time till he yearned for thestrong clasp of the hand which guided him through the darkest passage ofhis life.Two years passed. In a fairy cottage on the banks of the Thames betweenTeddington Lock and Hampton Bridge George Talboys lives with his sisterand brother-in-law the latter having now obtained success at the Bar.Georgey pays occasional visits from Eton to play with a pretty babycousin. It is a year since a black-edged letter came to Robert Audleyannouncing that Madame Taylor had died after a long illness whichMonsieur Val described as _maladie de longueur_. Sir Michael Audleylives in London with Alicia who is very shortly to become the wife ofSir Harry Towers a sporting Herts baronet.                                   EDWARD BRADLEY "CUTHBERT BEDE"The Adventures of Mr. Verdant Green      Edward Bradley is one of few English humorists of the     mid-Victorian era who produced any work that is likely to     survive the wear of time and change of taste. "The Adventures     of Mr. Verdant Green" his earliest and best story is in its     way a masterpiece. Never has the lighter and gayer side of     Oxford life been depicted with so much humour and fidelity     and what makes this achievement still more remarkable is the     fact that Cuthbert Bede to give Bradley the name which he     adopted for literary purposes and made famous was not an     Oxford man. He was born at Kidderminster in 1827 and educated     at Durham University with the idea of becoming a clergyman.     But not being old enough to take orders he stayed for a year     at Oxford without however matriculating there. At the age     of twenty he began to write for "Punch" and "The Adventures     of Verdant Green" was composed in 1853 when he was still on     the staff of that paper. The book on its publication had an     immense vogue and though twenty-six other books followed from     his pen it is still the most popular. He died on December 11     1889._I.--A Very Quiet Party_As Mr. Verdant Green was sitting sad and lonely in his roomsoverlooking the picturesque mediaeval quadrangle of Brazenface CollegeOxford a German band began to play "Home Sweet Home" with that truthand delicacy of expression which the wandering minstrels of Germany seemto acquire intuitively. The sweet melancholy of the air as it camesubdued into softer tones by distance would probably have moved any ladwho had just been torn from the shelter of his family to fight allinexperienced the battle of life. On Mr. Verdant Green it had such anoverwhelming effect that when his scout Filcher entered the room hefound his master looking very red about the eyes and furiously wipingthe large spectacles from which his nick-name "Gig-lamps" was derived.The fact was that Mr. Verdant Green was a freshman of the freshest kind.It was his first day in Oxford. He had been brought up entirely by hismother and a maiden aunt. Happily Mr. Larkyns the rector of ManorGreen the charming Warwickshire village of which the Greens had beensquires from time immemorial convinced his mother that Verdant neededthe society of young men of his own age. Mr. Larkyn's own son a manlyyoung fellow named Charles had already been sent up to BrazenfaceCollege where he was rapidly distinguishing himself and after manytears and arguments Mrs. Green had consented to her boy also going upto Oxford.As we have said Mr. Verdant Green felt very tearful and lonely as hisscout entered his rooms. But the appearance of Filcher reminded him thathe was now an Oxford man and he resolved to begin his career by calling
comment225,upon Mr. Charles Larkyns.He found Mr. Larkyns lolling on a couch in dressing-gown and slippers.Opposite to him was a gentleman whose face was partly hidden by a pewterpot out of which he was draining the last draught. Mr. Larkyns turnedhis head and saw dimly through the clouds of tobacco smoke that filledhis room a tall thin spectacled figure with a hat in one hand and anenvelope in the other."It's no use" he said "stealing a march on me in this way. I don't oweyou anything and if I did it is not convenient to pay it. Hang youOxford tradesmen You really make a man thoroughly bill-ious. Tell yourmaster that I can't get any money out of my governor till I've got mydegree. Now make yourself scarce You know where the door lies"Mr. Verdant Green was so confounded at this unusual reception that helost the power of motion and speech. But as Mr. Larkyns advanced towardshim in a threatening attitude he managed to gasp out "Why CharlesLarkyns don't you remember me Verdant Green""'Pon my word old fellow" said his friend "I thought you were a dun.There are so many wretched tradesmen in this place who labour under theimpression that because a man buys a thing he means to pay for it thatmy life is mostly spent in dodging their messengers. Allow me" headded "to introduce you to Mr. Smalls. You will find him very useful inhelping you in your studies. He himself reads so hard that he is calleda fast man."Mr. Smalls put down his pewter pot and said that he had much pleasurein forming the acquaintance of a freshman like Mr. Verdant Green whichwas undoubtedly true. And he then showed his absorbing interest inliterary studies by neglecting the society of Mr. Verdant Green andimmersing himself in the perusal of one of those vivid accounts of "arattling set-to between Nobby Buffer and Hammer Sykes" which make"Bell's Life" the favourite reading of many Oxford scholars."I heard from my governor" said Mr. Larkyns "that you were coming upand in the course of the morning I should have come to look you up. Havea cigar old chap""Er--er--thank you very much" said Verdant in a frightened way "but Ihave never smoked.""Never smoked" exclaimed Mr. Smalls holding up "Bell's Life" andmaking private signals to Mr. Larkyns. "You'll soon get the better ofthat weakness As you are a freshman let me give you a little advice.You know what deep readers the Germans are. That is because they smokemore than we do. I should advise you to go at once to thevice-chancellor and ask him for a box of good cigars. He will bedelighted to find you are beginning to set to work so soon."Mr. Verdant Green thanked Mr. Smalls for his kind advice and said thathe would go without delay to the vice-chancellor. And Mr. Smalls was sodelighted with the joke for the vice-chancellor took severe steps toprevent undergraduates from indulging in the fragrant weed that heinvited Verdant to wine with him that evening."Just a small quiet party of hard-working men" said Mr. Smalls. "I hopeyou don't object to a very quiet party.""Oh dear no I much prefer a quiet party" said Mr. Verdant Green"indeed I have always been used to quiet parties and I shall be veryglad to come."In order to while away the time between then and evening Mr. CharlesLarkyns offered to take Mr. Verdant Green over Oxford and put him up toa thing or two and show him some of the freshman's sights. Naturallyhe got a considerable amount of fun out of his young and very credulous
comment226,friend. For some weeks afterwards Mr. Verdant Green never met any ofthe gorgeously robed beadles of the university without taking his hatoff and making them a profound bow. For according to his informationone of them was the vice-chancellor and the rest were variousdignitaries and famous men.By the time the inventive powers of Mr. Larkyns were exhausted it wasnecessary to dress for the very quiet party. Some hours afterwards Mr.Verdant Green was standing in a room filled with smoke and noiseleaning rather heavily against the table. His friends had first temptedhim with a cigar then as his first smoke produced the strange effectscommon in these cases they had induced him to take a little strongpunch as a remedy. He was now leaning against the table in answer to thecall of "Mr. Gig-lamps for a song." Having decided upon one of thosevocal efforts which in the bosom of his family met with great applausehe began to sing in low and plaintive tones "'I dre-eamt that I dweltin Mar-ar-ble Halls with'"--and then alarmed by hearing the sound ofhis own voice he stopped."Try back Verdant" shouted Mr. Larkyns.Mr. Verdant Green tried back but with an increased confusion of ideasresulting from the mixture of milk-punch and strong cigars. "'I dre-eamtthat I dwe-elt in Mar-arble Halls with vassals and serfs at mysi-hi-hide and--'--I beg your pardon gentlemen I really forget----ohI know--'And I also dre-eamt which ple-eased me most--' No that's notit."And smiling very amiably he sank down on the carpet and went to sleepunder the table. Some time afterwards two men were seen carrying aninert body across the quad they took it upstairs and put it on a bed.And late the next morning Mr. Verdant Green woke up with a splittingheadache and wished that he had never been born.As time went on all the well-known practical jokes were played uponhim and gradually--and sometimes painfully--he learnt the wisdom thatis not taught in books nor acquired from maiden aunts._II.--Mr. Verdant Green Does as He Has Been Done By_One morning Mr. Green and one of his friends little Mr. Bouncer werelounging in the gateway of Brazenface when a modest-looking young mancame towards them. He seemed so ill at ease in his frock coat and highcollar that he looked as if he were wearing these articles for the firsttime."I'll bet you a bottle of blacking Gig-lamps" said Mr. Bouncer "thatwe have here an intending freshman. Let us take a rise out of him.""Can you direct me to Brazenface College please sir" said theyouthful stranger flushing like a girl."This is Brazenface College" said Mr. Bouncer looking very important."And pray what is your business here and your name""If you please" said the stranger "I am James Pucker. I came to enter
comment227,sir for my matriculation examination and I wish to see the gentlemanwho will examine me.""Then you've come to the proper quarter young man" said Mr. Bouncer."Here is Mr. Pluckem" turning to Mr. Verdant Green "the juniorexaminer."Mr. Verdant Green took his cue with astonishing aptitude and glaredthrough his glasses at the trembling blushing Mr. Pucker."And here" continued Mr. Bouncer pointing to Mr. Fosbrooke who wascoming up the street "is the gentleman who will assist Mr. Pluckem inexamining you.""It will be extremely inconvenient to me to examine you now" said Mr.Fosbrooke "but as you probably wish to return home as soon aspossible I will endeavour to conclude the business at once. Mr.Bouncer will you have the goodness to bring this young gentleman to myrooms"Leaving Mr. Pucker to express his thanks for this great kindness to Mr.Bouncer who whiled away the time by telling him terrible stories aboutthe matriculation ordeal Mr. Verdant Green and Fosbrooke ran upstairsand spread a newspaper over a heap of pipes and pewter pots and bottlesof ale and prepared a table with pen ink and scribble-paper. Soonafterwards Mr. Bouncer led in the unsuspecting victim."Take a seat sir" said Mr. Fosbrooke gravely. And Mr. Pucker put hishat on the ground and sat down at the table in a state of blushingnervousness. "Have you been at a public school""Yes sir" stammered the victim "a very public one sir. It was aboarding school sir. I was a day boy sir and in the first class.""First class of an uncommon slow train" muttered Mr. Bouncer."Now sir" continued Mr. Fosbrooke "let us see what your Latin writingis like. Have the goodness to turn what I have written into Latin andbe very careful" added Mr. Fosbrooke sternly "be very careful that itis good Latin" And he handed Mr. Pucker a sheet of paper on which hehad scribbled the following"To be turned into Latin after the Manner of the Animals of Tacitus Shewent into the garden to cut a cabbage to make an apple-pie. Just then agreat she-bear coming down the street poked its nose into the shopwindow. 'What No soap Bosh' So he died and she very imprudentlymarried the barber. And there were present at the wedding theJoblillies and the Piccannies and the Gobelites and the greatPanjandrum himself with the little button on top. So they all set toplaying catch-who-catch-can till the gunpowder ran out at the heels oftheir boots."It was well for the purposes of the hoaxers that Mr. Pucker'strepidation prevented him from making a calm perusal of the paper hewas nervously doing his best to turn the nonsensical English word byword into equally nonsensical Latin when his limited powers of Latinwriting were brought to a full stop by the untranslatable word "bosh."As he could make nothing of this he gazed appealingly at the benignantfeatures of Mr. Verdant Green. The appealing gaze was answered by ourhero ordering Mr. Pucker to hand in his paper and reply to thequestions on history and Euclid. Mr. Pucker took the two papers ofquestions and read as followsHISTORY."1. Show the strong presumption there is that Nox was the god ofbattles."2. In what way were the shades on the banks of the Styx supplied withspirits"3. Give a brief account of the Roman emperors who visited the UnitedStates and state what they did there.EUCLID."1. Show the fallacy of defining an angle as a worm at one end and afool at the other.
comment228,"2. If a freshman _A_ have any mouth _x_ and a bottle of wine _y_ showhow many applications of _x_ to _y_ will place _y__y_ before _A_."3. Find the value of a 'bob' a 'tanner' a 'joey' a 'tizzy' a'poney' and a 'monkey.'"4. If seven horses eat twenty-five acres of grass in three days whatwill be their condition on the fourth day Prove this by practice."Mr. Pucker did not know what to make of such extraordinary andunexpected questions. He blushed tried to write fingered his curlsand then gave himself over to despair whereupon Mr. Bouncer was seizedwith an immoderate fit of laughter which brought the farce almost to anend."I'm afraid young gentleman" said Mr. Bouncer "that your learning isnot yet up to the Brazenface standard. But we will give you one morechance to retrieve yourself. We will try a little _viv voce_ Mr.Pucker. If a coach-wheel 6 inches in diameter and 5 inches incircumference makes 240 revolutions in a second how many men will ittake to do the same piece of work in ten days"Mr. Pucker grew redder and hotter than before and gasped like a fishout of water."I see you will not do for us yet awhile" said his tormentor "and weare therefore under the painful necessity of rejecting you. I shouldadvise you to read hard for another twelve months and try to masterthose subjects in which you have now failed."Disregarding poor Mr. Pucker's entreaties to matriculate him this oncefor the sake of his mother when he would read very hard--indeed hewould--Mr. Fosbrooke turned to Mr. Bouncer and gave him some privateinstructions and Mr. Verdant Green immediately disappeared in search ofhis scout Filcher. Five minutes afterwards as the dejected Mr. Puckerwas crawling out of the quad Filcher came and led him back to the roomsof Mr. Slowcoach the real examining tutor."But I have been examined" Mr. Pucker kept on saying dejectedly. "Ihave been examined and they rejected me.""I think it was an 'oax sir" said Filcher."A what" stammered Mr. Pucker."A 'oax--a sell" said the scout. "Those two gents has been 'aving alittle game with you sir. They often does it with fresh parties likeyou sir that seem fresh and hinnocent like."Mr. Pucker was immensely relieved at this news and at once went to Mr.Slowcoach who after an examination of twenty minutes passed him. ButFilcher was alarmed at the joyful way in which he rushed out of thetutor's room."You didn't tell 'im about the 'oax sir did yer" asked the scoutanxiously."Not a word" said the radiant Mr. Pucker."Then you're a trump sir" said Filcher. "And Mr. Verdant Green'scompliments to yer sir and will you come up to his rooms and take aglass of wine with him sir"It need hardly be said that the blushing Mr. Pucker passed a very
comment229,pleasant evening with his new friends and that Mr. Verdant Green wasvery proud of having got so far out of the freshman's stage of existenceas to take part in one of the most successful hoaxes in the history ofOxford._III.--Town and Gown_Mr. Verdant Green Mr. Charles Larkyns and a throng of theiracquaintances were sitting in Mr. Bouncer's rooms on the evening ofNovember 5 when a knock at the oak was heard and as Mr. Bouncer roaredout "Come in" the knocker entered. Opening the door and striking intoan attitude he exclaimed in a theatrical tone and manner"Scene Mr. Bouncer's rooms in Brazenface in the centre a table atwhich a party are drinking log-juice and smoking cabbage leaves. Doorleft third entrance. Enter the Putney Pet. Slow music lights halfdown."Even Mr. Verdant Green did not require to be told the profession of thePutney Pet. His thick-set frame his hard-featured battered hang-dogface proclaimed him a prize-fighter."Now for a toast gentlemen" said Mr. Bouncer. "May the Gown give theTown a jolly good hiding"This was received with great applause and the Putney Pet was dressedout in a gown and mortar-board and the whole party then sallied out tobattle. From time immemorial it has been the custom at Oxford for thetown-people and the scholars to engage at least once a year in a wildscrimmage and the pitched battle was now due. No doubt it was not quitefair for the men of Brazenface to bring the Putney Pet up from Londonfor the occasion but for some years Gown had been defeated by Town andthey were resolved to have their revenge.When Mr. Bouncer's party turned the corner of Saint Mary's they foundthat the Town as usual had taken the initiative and in a dense bodyhad swept the High Street and driven all the gownsmen before them. Asmall knot of 'varsity men were manfully struggling against superiornumbers by St. Mary's Hall."Gown to the rescue" shouted Mr. Bouncer as he dashed across thestreet. "Come on Pet Here we are in the thick of it just in the nickof time"Poor Mr. Verdant Green had never learnt to box. He was a lover of peaceand quietness and would have preferred to have watched the battle froma college window but he had been drawn in the fray against his will byMr. Bouncer. He now rushed into the scrimmage with no idea of fightingand a valiant bargee singled him out as an easy prey and aimed a heavyblow at him. Instinctively doubling his fists Mr. Verdant Green foundthat necessity was indeed the mother of invention and with a passingthought of what would be his mother's and his maiden aunt's feelingscould they see him fighting with a common bargeman he managed to guardoff the blow. But he was not so fortunate in the second round for thebargee knocked him down but was happily knocked down in turn by thePutney Pet. The language of this gentle and refined scholar had becomevery peculiar."There's a squelcher for you my kivey" he said to the bargee as hesent him sprawling. Then turning round he asked a townsman "What doyou charge for a pint of Dutch pink" following up the question bystriking him on the nose.Unused to being questioned in this violent way the town party at lastturned and fled and the gownsmen went in search of other foes toconquer. Even Mr. Verdant Green felt desperately courageous when thetown took to their heels and vanished.At Exeter College another town-and-gown fight was raging furiously. The
comment230,town mob had come across the Senior Proctor the Rev. Thomas Tozer andwhile Old Towzer as he was called was trying to assert his proctorialauthority over them they had jeered him and torn his clothes andbespattered him with mud. A small group of gownsmen rushed to hisrescue."Oh this is painful" said the Rev. Thomas Tozer putting thehandkerchief to his bleeding nose. "This is painful This is exceedinglypainful gentlemen"He was at once surrounded by sympathising undergraduates who begged himto allow them to charge the town at once. But the Town far outnumberedthe Gown and in spite of the assistance of the reverend proctor thefight was going against them. The Rev. Thomas Tozer had just beenknocked down for the first time in his life and the cry of "Gown to therescue" fell very pleasantly on his ears. Mr. Verdant Green helped himto rise while the Putney Pet stepped before him and struck out rightand left. Ten minutes of scientific pugilism and the fate of the battlewas decided. The Town fled every way and the Rev. Thomas Tozer was atlast able to look calmly about him. He at once resumed his proctorialduties."Why have you not on your gown sir" he said to the Putney Pet."I ax yer pardon guv'nor" said the Pet deferentially. "I couldn't geton in it nohow. So I pocketed it but some cove has gone and priggedit.""I am unable to comprehend the nature of your language sir" said theRev. Thomas Tozer angrily thinking it was an impudent undergraduate. "Idon't understand you sir but I desire at once to know your name andcollege."Mr. Bouncer however succeeded in explaining matters to the proctorwho then congratulated the Pet on having displayed pugilistic powersworthy of the Xystics of the noblest days of Ancient Rome. Both the Petand the undergraduates wondered what a Xystic was but instead ofinquiring further into the matter they went to the Roebuck whereafter a supper of grilled bones and welsh-rabbits Mr. Verdant Greengave "by particular request" his now celebrated song "The Mar-arbleHalls."The forehead of the singer was decorated with a patch of brown paperfrom which arose a strong smell of vinegar. But he was not ashamed ofit indeed he wore it all the next day and was sorry when he had totake it off--for was it not in a way a badge of courageFrom this time Mr. Verdant Green began to despise mere reading-men whonever went in for sports. He resolved at once to go in for them all. Hetook to rowing and was rescued from a watery grave by Mr. Bouncer.Then defeated but undaunted he took to riding and was thrown off. Butwhat did it matter Before the term ended he grew more accustomed tothe management of Oxford tubs and Oxford hacks.It is true that the unfeeling man who reported the Torpid races for"Bell's Life" had the unkindness to state in cold print "Worcestersucceeded in making the bump at the Cherwell in consequence of No. 3 ofthe Brazenface boat suffering from fatigue." And on the copy of thejournal sent to Mrs. Green of Manor Green her son sadly drew a pencilline under "No. 3" and wrote "This was me." But both Mrs. Green andMiss Virginia Green were more than consoled when their beloved boyreturned home about midsummer with a slip of paper on which was writtenand printedGREEN VERDANT . Coll. AEn.

comment231,                     ROBERTUS JONES.In other words Mr. Verdant Green had got through his Smalls. But sadto say poor Mr. Bouncer had been plucked.Mr. Verdant Green smiled to himself. It was the sheerest bit of goodluck that he had managed to get through. Still he had learned more atOxford than was taught in books--he had learned to be a manly fellow inspite of his gig-lamps.                                   CHARLOTTE BRONTJane Eyre      Charlotte Bront was born at Thornton Yorkshire England on     the 21st of April 1816 of Irish and Cornish stock. By reason     of her father's manner of living she was utterly deprived of     all companions of her own age. She therefore lived in a little     world of her own and by the time she was thirteen years of     age it had become her constant habit and one of her few     pleasures to weave imaginary tales idealising her favorite     historical heroes and setting forth in narrative form her own     thoughts and feelings. Both Charlotte and her sisters Emily     and Anne early found refuge in their habits of composition     and about 1845 made their first literary venture--a small     volume of poems. This was not successful but the authors were     encouraged to make a further trial and each began to prepare     a prose tale. "Jane Eyre" perhaps the most poignant     love-story in the English tongue was published on October 16     1847. Its title ran "Jane Eyre an Autobiography. Edited by     Currer Bell." The romantic story of its acceptance by the     publishers has been told in our condensation of Mrs. Gaskell's     "Life of Charlotte Bront." See LIVES AND LETTERS Vol. IX.     Written secretly under the pressure of incessant domestic     anxiety as if with the very life-blood of its author the     wonderful intensity of the story kindled the imagination of     the reading public in an extraordinary degree and the     popularity at once attained has never flagged. Though the     experiences of Jane Eyre were not except in comparatively     unimportant episodes the experiences of the authoress Jane     Eyre is Charlotte Bront. One of the most striking features of
comment232,     the book--a feature preserved in the following summary--is the     haunting suggestion of sympathy between nature and human     emotion. The publication of "Jane Eyre" removed its authoress     from almost straitened circumstances and a narrow round of     life to material comfort and congenial society. In reality it     endowed at once the most diffident of women with lasting fame.     After a brief period of married life Charlotte Bront died on     March 31 1855._I.--The Master of Thornfield Hall_Thornfield my new home after I left school was I found a fine oldbattlemented hall and Mrs. Fairfax who had answered my advertisementa mild elderly lady related by marriage to Mr. Rochester the owner ofthe estate and the guardian of Adela Varens my little pupil.It was not till three months after my arrival there that my adventuresbegan. One day Mrs. Fairfax proposed to show me over the house much ofwhich was unoccupied. The third storey especially had the aspect of ahome of the past--a shrine of memory. I liked its hush and quaintness."If there were a ghost at Thornfield Hall this would be its haunt" saidMrs. Fairfax as we passed the range of apartments on our way to see theview from the roof.I was pacing through the corridor of the third floor on my return whenthe last sound I expected in so still a region struck my ear--a laughdistinct formal mirthless. At first it was very low but it passed offin a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every lonely chamber."Mrs. Fairfax" I called out "did you hear that laugh Who is it""Some of the servants very likely" she answered "perhaps Grace Poole."The laugh was repeated in a low tone and terminated in an odd murmur."Grace" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.I didn't expect Grace to answer for the laugh was preternatural.Nevertheless the door nearest me opened and a servant came out--a setsquare-made figure with a hard plain face."Too much noise Grace" said Mrs. Fairfax. "Remember directions"Grace curtseyed silently and went in.Not unfrequently after that I heard Grace Poole's laugh and hereccentric murmurs stranger than her laugh.Late one fine calm afternoon in January I volunteered to carry to thepost at Hay two miles distant a letter Mrs. Fairfax had just written.The lane to Hay inclined uphill all the way and having reached themiddle I sat on a stile till the sun went down and on the hill-topabove me stood the rising moon. The village was a mile distant but in
comment233,the absolute hush I could hear plainly its murmurs of life.A rude noise broke on the fine ripplings and whisperings of the eveningcalm a metallic clatter a horse was coming. The windings of the lanehid it as it approached. Then I heard a rush under the hedge and closeby glided a great dog not staying to look up. The horse followed--atall steed and on its back a rider. He passed a sliding sound aclattering tumble and man and horse were down. They had slipped on thesheet of ice which glased the causeway. The dog came bounding backsniffed round the prostrate group and then ran up to me it was all hecould do. I obeyed him and walked down to the traveller strugglinghimself free of his steed. I think he was swearing but am not certain."Can I do anything" I asked."You can stand on one side" he answered as he rose. Whereupon began aheaving stamping process accompanied by a barking and baying and thehorse was re-established and the dog silenced with a "Down Pilot""If you are hurt and want help sir" I remarked "I can fetch someoneeither from Thornfield Hall or from Hay.""Thank you I shall do. I have no broken bones only a sprain." And helimped to the stile.He had a dark face with stern features and a heavy brow. His eyes andgathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted he was past youth but hadnot reached middle age--perhaps he might be thirty-five. I felt no fearof him and but little shyness. His frown and roughness set me at ease.He waved me to go but I said"I cannot think of leaving you in this solitary lane till you are fit tomount your horse.""You ought to be at home yourself" said he. "Where do you come from""From just below.""Do you mean that house with the battlements""Yes sir.""Whose house is it""Mr. Rochester's.""Do you know Mr. Rochester""No I have never seen him.""You are not a servant at the Hall of course. You are--""I am the governess.""Ah the governess" he repeated. "Deuce take me if I had not forgottenExcuse me" he continued "necessity compels me to make you useful."He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder limped to his horse caught thebridle and grimacing grimly sprang into the saddle and with a "Thankyou" bounded away.When I returned from Hay after posting Mrs. Fairfax's letter I went to
comment234,her room. She was not there but sitting upright on the rug was a greatblack-and-white long-haired dog. I went forward and said "Pilot" andthe thing got up came to me sniffed me and wagged his great tail. Irang the bell."What dog is this""He came with master who has just arrived. He has had an accident andhis ankle is sprained."The next day I was summoned to take tea with Mr. Rochester and my pupil.When I entered he was looking at Adela who knelt on the hearth besidePilot."Here is Miss Eyre sir" said Mrs. Fairfax in her quiet way.Mr. Rochester bowed still not taking his eyes from the group of the dogand the child.I sat down disembarrassed. Politeness might have confused me capricelaid me under no obligation.Mrs. Fairfax seemed to think someone should be amiable and she began totalk."Madam I should like some tea" was the sole rejoinder she got."Come to the fire" said the master when the tray was taken away. "Whenyou came on me in Hay lane last night I thought unaccountably of fairytales and had half a mind to demand whether you had bewitched my horse.I am not sure yet. Who are your parents""I have none.""I thought not. And so you were waiting for your people when you sat onthat stile""For whom sir""For the men in green. Did I break through one of your rings that youspread that ice on the causeway"I shook my head."The men in green all forsook England a hundred years ago. I don't thinkeither summer or harvest or winter moon will ever shine on their revelsmore."Mrs. Fairfax dropped her knitting wondering what sort of talk this wasand remarked that Miss Eyre had been a kind and careful teacher."Don't trouble yourself to give her a character" returned Mr.Rochester. "I shall judge for myself. She began by felling my horse.""You said Mr. Rochester was not peculiar Mrs. Fairfax" I remonstratedwhen I rejoined her in her room after putting Adela to bed.After a time my master's manner towards me changed. It became moreuniform. I never seemed in his way. He did not take fits of chillinghauteur. When he met me the encounter seemed welcome he always had aword and sometimes a smile. I felt at times as if he were my relationrather than my master and so happy did I become that the blanks ofexistence were filled up. He had now been resident eight weeks thoughMrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed at the Hall longer than a fortnight._II.--The Mystery of the Third Floor_One night I hardly know whether I had been sleeping or musing Istarted wide awake on hearing a vague murmur peculiar and lugubrious.It ceased but my heart beat anxiously my inward tranquillity wasbroken. The clock far down in the hall struck two. Just then mychamber-door was touched as if fingers swept the panels groping a wayalong the dark gallery outside. I was chilled with fear. Then Iremembered that it might be Pilot and the idea calmed me. But it wasfated I should not sleep that night for at the very keyhole of mychamber as it seemed a demoniac laugh was uttered. My first impulsewas to rise and fasten the bolt my next to cry "Who is there" Erelong steps retreated up the gallery towards the third floor staircaseand then all was still."Was it Grace Poole" thought I. I hurried on my frock and with atrembling hand opened the door. There burning outside left on thematting of the gallery was a candle and the air was filled with smokewhich rushed in a cloud from Mr. Rochester's room. In an instant I waswithin the chamber. Tongues of fire darted round the bed the curtainswere on fire and in the midst lay Mr. Rochester in deep sleep. I shookhim but he seemed stupefied. Then I rushed to his basin and ewer anddeluged the bed with water. He woke with the cry "Is there a floodWhat is it"I briefly related what had transpired. He was now in his dressing-gownand warning me to stay where I was and call no one he added "I mustpay a visit to the third floor." A long time elapsed ere he returned
comment235,pale and gloomy."I have found it all out" said he "it is as I thought. You are notalking fool. Say nothing about it."He held out his hand as we parted. I gave him mine he took it in bothhis own."You have saved my life. I have a pleasure in owing you so immense adebt. I feel your benefits no burden Jane."Strange energy was in his voice.Till morning I was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea. In the morningI heard the servants exclaim how providential that master thought of thewater-jug when he had left the candle alight and passing the room Isaw sewing rings on the new curtains no other than--Grace Poole.Company now came to the hall including the beautiful Miss Ingram whomrumour associated with Mr. Rochester as I heard from Mrs. Fairfax.One day Mr. Rochester had been called away from home and on his returnas I was the first inmate of the house to meet him I remarked "Oh areyou aware Mr. Rochester that a stranger has arrived since you leftthis morning""A stranger no I expected no one did he give his name""His name is Mason sir and he comes from the West Indies."Mr. Rochester was standing near me and as I spoke he gave my wrist aconvulsive grip while a spasm caught his breath and he turned whiterthan ashes."Do you feel ill sir" I inquired."Jane I've got a blow I've got a blow Jane" he staggered.Then he sat down and made me sit beside him."My little friend" said he "I wish I were in a quiet island with onlyyou and trouble and danger and hideous recollections were removed fromme.""Can I help you sir I'd give my life to serve you.""Jane if aid is wanted I'll seek it at your hands.""Thank you sir tell me what to do.""Go back into the room step quietly up to Mason tell him Mr. Rochesterhas come and wishes to see him show him in here and then leave me."At a late hour that night I heard the visitors repair to their chambersand Mr. Rochester saying "This way Mason this is your room."He spoke cheerfully and the gay tones set my heart at ease.Awaking in the dead of night I stretched my hand to draw the curtainfor the moon was full and bright. Good God What a cry The night wasrent in twain by a savage shrilly sound that ran from end to end ofThornfield Hall.The cry died and was not renewed. Indeed whatever being uttered thatfearful shriek could not soon repeat it not the widest-winged condor onthe Andes could twice in succession send out such a yell from thecloud shrouding his eyrie.It came out of the third storey. And overhead--yes in the room justabove my chamber I heard a deadly struggle and a half-smothered voiceshout "Help help"A chamber door opened someone rushed along the gallery. Another stepstamped on the floor above and something fell. Then there was silence.The sleepers were all aroused and gathered in the gallery which but forthe moonlight would have been in complete darkness. The door at the endof the gallery opened and Mr. Rochester advanced with a candle. He hadjust descended from the upper storey."All's right" he cried. "A servant has had a nightmare that is alland has taken a fit with fright. Now I must see you all back to yourrooms." And so by dint of coaxing and commanding he contrived to getthem back to their dormitories.I retreated unnoticed and dressed myself carefully to be ready foremergencies. About an hour passed and then a cautious hand tapped lowat my door."Are you up and dressed""Yes.""Then come out quietly."Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light."Bring a sponge and some volatile salts" said he.I did so and followed him.
comment236,"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood""I think not I have never been tried yet."We entered a room with an inner apartment from whence came a snarlingsnatching sound. Mr. Rochester went forward into this apartment and ashout of laughter greeted his entrance. Grace Poole then was there.When he came out he closed the door behind him."Here Jane" he said.I walked round to the other side of the large bed in the outer room andthere in an easy-chair his head leaned back I recognised the pale andseemingly lifeless face of the stranger Mason. His linen on one sideand one arm was almost soaked in blood.Mr. Rochester took the sponge dipped it in water moistened thecorpse-like face and applied my smelling-bottle to the nostrils.Mr. Mason unclosed his eyes and murmured "Is there immediate danger""Pooh--a mere scratch I'll fetch a surgeon now and you'll be able tobe removed by the morning.""Jane" he continued "you'll sponge the blood when it returns and putyour salts to his nose and you'll not speak to him on any pretext--andRichard it will be at the peril of your life if you speak to her."Two hours later the surgeon came and removed the injured man.In the morning I heard Rochester in the yard saying to some of thevisitors "Mason got the start of you all this morning he was gonebefore sunrise. I rose to see him off."_III.--The Shadowy Walk_A splendid midsummer shone over England. In the sweetest hour of thetwenty-four after the sun had gone down in simple state and dew fellcool on the panting plain I had walked into the orchard to the gianthorse-chestnut near the sunk fence that separates the Hall grounds fromthe lonely fields when there came to me the warning fragrance of Mr.Rochester's cigar. I was about to retreat when he intercepted me andsaid "Turn back Jane on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in thehouse." I did not like to walk alone with my master at this hour in theshadowy orchard but could find no reason for leaving him."Jane" he recommenced as we slowly strayed down in the direction ofthe horse-chestnut "Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer is itnot""Yes sir.""And you must have become in some degree attached to it""I am attached to it indeed.""Pity" he said and paused."Must I move on sir" I asked."I believe you must Jane."This was a blow but I did not let it prostrate me."Then you are going to be married sir""In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom. We have been good friendsJane have we not""Yes sir.""Here is the chestnut-tree come we will sit here in peace to-night."He seated me and himself."Jane do you hear the nightingale singing in the wood Listen"In listening I sobbed convulsively for I could repress what I enduredno longer and when I did speak it was only to express an impetuouswish that I had never been born or never come to Thornfield."Because you are sorry to leave it"
comment237,The vehemence of emotion was claiming mastery and struggling for fullsway--to overcome to live rise and reign at last yes--and to speak."I grieve to leave Thornfield. I love Thornfield because I have livedin it a full and delightful life. I have not been trampled on I havenot been petrified. I have talked face to face with what I delightin--an original a vigorous and expanded mind. I have known you Mr.Rochester. I see the necessity of departure but it is like looking onthe necessity of death.""Where do you see the necessity" he asked suddenly."Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you" I retorted rousedto something like passion. "Do you think because I am poor obscureplain and little I am soulless and heartless You think wrong I haveas much soul as you--and full as much heart I am not talking to you nowthrough the medium of custom conventionalities nor even mortal flesh.It is my spirit that addresses your spirit just as if both had passedthrough the grave and we stood at God's feet equal--as we are""As we are" repeated Mr. Rochester gathering me to his heart andpressing his lips on my lips. "So Jane""Yes so sir" I replied. "I have spoken my mind and can go anywherenow. Let me go""Jane be still don't struggle so like a wild frantic bird rendingits own plumage in its desperation.""I am no bird and no net ensnares me. I am a free human being with anindependent will which I now exert to leave you."Another effort set me at liberty and I stood erect before him."And your will shall decide your destiny" he said. "I offer you myhand my heart and a share in all my possessions."A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel walk and trembled throughthe boughs of the chestnut it wandered away--away to an infinitedistance--it died. The nightingale's song was then the only voice of thehour in listening to it again I wept.Mr. Rochester sat looking at me gently and at last said drawing me tohim again "My bride is here because my equal is here and my likeness.Jane will you marry me Give me my name--Edward. Say 'I will marryyou.'""Are you in earnest Do you love me Do you sincerely wish me to be yourwife""I do. I swear it""Then sir I will marry you.""God pardon me and man meddle not with me. I have her and will holdher"But what had befallen the night And what ailed the chestnut-tree It
comment238,writhed and groaned while the wind roared in the laurel walk."We must go in" said Mr. Rochester "the weather changes."He hurried me up the walk but we were wet before we could pass thethreshold._IV.--The Mystery Explained_There were no groomsmen no bridesmaids no relatives to wait for ormarshal none but Mr. Rochester and I. I wonder what other bridegroomlooked as he did--so bent up to a purpose so resolutely grim. Our placewas taken at the communion rails. All was still two shadows only movedin a remote corner of the church.As the clergyman's lips unclosed to ask "Wilt thou have this woman forthy wedded wife" a distinct and near voice said "The marriage cannotgo on. I declare the existence of an impediment.""What is the nature of the impediment" asked the clergyman."It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage" said thespeaker. "Mr. Rochester has a wife now living."My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibratedto thunder. I looked at Mr. Rochester I made him look at me. His facewas colourless rock his eye both spark and flint he seemed as if hewould defy all things."Mr. Mason have the goodness to step forward" said the stranger."Are you aware sir whether or not this gentleman's wife is stillliving" inquired the clergyman."She is now living at Thornfield Hall" said Mason with white lips. "Isaw her there last April. I am her brother."I saw a grim smile contract Mr. Rochester's lip."Enough" said he. "Wood"--to the clergyman--"close your book JohnGreen"--to the clerk--"leave the church there will be no weddingto-day.""Bigamy is an ugly word" he continued "but I meant to be a bigamist.This girl thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt she was goingto be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded wretch alreadybound to a bad mad and embruted partner. Follow me. I invite you allto visit Grace Poole's patient and my wife"We passed up to the third storey and there in the deep shade of theinner room beyond the room where I had watched over the wounded Masonran backward and forward seemingly on all fours a figure whetherbeast or human one could not at first sight tell. It snatched andgrowled like some wild animal. It was covered with clothing but aquantity of dark grizzled hair wild as a mane hid its head and face."That is my wife" said Mr. Rochester "whom I was cheated into marryingfifteen years ago--a mad woman and a drunkard of a family of idiots andmaniacs for three generations. And this is what I wished tohave"--laying his hand on my shoulder--"this young girl who stands sograve and quiet at the mouth of hell. Jane" he continued in anagonised tone "I never meant to wound you thus."Reader I forgave him at the moment and on the spot. I forgave him allyet not in words not outwardly only at my heart's core.That night I never thought to sleep but a slumber fell on me as soon asI lay down in bed and in my sleep a vision spoke to my spirit"Daughter flee temptation" I rose with the dim dawn. One wordcomprised my intolerable duty--DepartAfter three days wandering and starvation on the north-midland moorsfor hastily and secretly I had travelled by coach as far from Thornfieldas my money would carry me I found a temporary home at the vicarage ofMorton until the clergyman of that moorland parish Mr. St. JohnRivers secured for me--under the assumed name of Jane Elliott--themistresship of the village school.
comment239,At Christmas I left the school. As the spring advanced St. John Riverswho with an icy heroism was possessed by the idea of becoming amissionary urged me strongly to accompany him to India as his wife onthe grounds that I was docile diligent and courageous and would bevery useful. I felt such veneration for him that I was tempted to ceasestruggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulfof his existence and there lose my own._V.--Reunion_The time came when he called on me to decide. I fervently longed to dowhat was right and only that. "Show me the path show me the path" Ientreated of Heaven.My heart beat fast and thick I heard its throb. Suddenly it stood stillto an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through. My senses roseexpectant ear and eye waited while the flesh quivered on my bones. Isaw nothing but I heard a voice somewhere cry "Jane Jane Jane"--nothing more."Oh God What is it" I gasped. I might have said "Where is it" forit did not seem in the room nor in the house nor in the garden norfrom overhead. And it was the voice of a human being--a lovedwell-remembered voice--that of Edward Fairfax Rochester and it spoke inpain and woe wildly eerily urgently."I am coming" I cried. "Wait for me" I ran out into the garden it wasvoid."Down superstition" I commented as that spectre rose up black by theblack yew at the gate.I mounted to my chamber locked myself in fell on my knees and seemedto penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit and my soul rushed out ingratitude at His feet.Then I rose from the thanksgiving took a resolve and lay downunscared enlightened eager but for the daylight.Thirty-six hours later I was crossing the fields to where I could seethe full front of my master's mansion and looking with a timorous joysaw--a blackened ruin.Where meantime was the hapless ownerI returned to the inn where the host himself a respectable middle-agedman brought my breakfast into the parlour. I scarcely knew how to beginmy questions."Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now""No ma'am--oh no No one is living there. It was burnt down aboutharvest time. The fire broke out at dead of night.""Was it known how it originated""They guessed ma'am they guessed. There was a lady--a--a lunatic keptin the house. She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs. Poole anable woman but for one fault--she kept a private bottle of gin by herand the mad lady would take the keys out of her pocket let herself outof her chamber and go roaming about the house doing any wild mischiefthat came into her head. Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire brokeout and he went up to the attics and got the servants out of their
comment240,beds and then went back to get his mad wife out of her cell. And thenthey called out to him that she was on the roof where she was wavingher arms and shouting till they could hear her a mile off. She was a bigwoman and had long black hair and we could see it streaming againstthe flames as she stood. We saw Mr. Rochester approach her and call'Bertha' And then ma'am she yelled and gave a spring and the nextminute lay dead smashed on the pavement.""Were any other lives lost""No. Perhaps it would have been better if there had. Poor Mr. Edward Heis stone-blind."I had dreaded he was mad."As he came down the great staircase it fell and he was taken out ofthe ruins with one eye knocked out and one hand so crushed that thesurgeon had to amputate it directly. The other eye inflamed and he lostthe sight of that also.""Where does he live now""At Ferndean a manor house on a farm he has--quite a desolate spot. OldJohn and his wife are with him he would have none else."To Ferndean I came just ere dusk walking the last mile. As Iapproached the narrow front door of the grange slowly opened and afigure came out into the twilight a man without a hat. He stretchedforth his hand to feel whether it rained. It was my master EdwardFairfax Rochester.He groped his way back to the house and re-entering it closed thedoor. I now drew near and knocked and John's wife opened for me."Mary" I said "how are you"She started as if she had seen a ghost. I calmed her and followed herinto the kitchen where I explained in a few words that I should stayfor the night and that John must fetch my trunk from the turnpikehouse. At this moment the parlour bell rang.Mary proceeded to fill a glass with water and place it on a traytogether with candles."Give the tray to me I will carry it in."The old dog Pilot pricked up his ears as I entered the room then hejumped up with a yelp and bounded towards me almost knocking the trayfrom my hands."What is the matter" inquired Mr. Rochester.He put out his hand with a quick gesture. "Who is this" he demandedimperiously."Will you have a little more water sir I spilt half of what was in theglass" I said."What is it Who speaks""Pilot knows me and John and Mary know I am here" I answered.He groped and arresting his wandering hand I prisoned it in bothmine."Her very fingers Her small slight fingers Is it Jane--Jane Eyre" hecried."My dear master I am Jane Eyre. I have found you out I am come back toyou"                                   Shirley      "Shirley" Charlotte Bront's second novel was published two     years after "Jane Eyre"--on October 26 1849. The writing of     it was a tragedy. When the book was begun her brother     Branwell and her two sisters Emily and Anne Bront were     alive. When it was finished all were dead and Charlotte was     left alone with her aged father. In the character of Shirley     Keeldar the novelist tried to depict her sister Emily as she     would have been had she been placed in health and prosperity.     Nearly all the characters were drawn from life and drawn so     vividly that they were recognised locally. Caroline Helstone     was sketched from Ellen Nussey Charlotte Bront's dearest     friend who furnished later much of the material for the best     biographies of the novelist. "Shirley" fully sustained at the     time of its publication the reputation won through "Jane
comment241,     Eyre" but under the test of time the story--owing no doubt     to the conditions under which it was written--has not taken     rank with that first-fruit of genius "Jane Eyre" or that     consummation of genius "Villette."_I.--In the Dark Days of the War_Released from the business yoke Robert Moore was if not livelyhimself a willing spectator of the liveliness of Caroline Helstone hiscousin a complacent listener to her talk a ready respondent to herquestions. Sometimes he was better than this--almost animated quitegentle and friendly. The drawback was that by the next morning he wasfrozen up again.To-night he stood on the kitchen hearth of Hollow's cottage after hisreturn from Whinbury cloth-market and Caroline who had come over tothe cottage from the vicarage stood beside him. Looking down hisglance rested on an uplifted face flushed smiling happy shaded withsilky curls lit with fine eyes. Moore placed his hand a moment on hisyoung cousin's shoulder stooped and left a kiss on her forehead."Are you certain Robert you are not fretting about your frames andyour business and the war" she asked."Not just now.""Are you positive you don't feel Hollow's cottage too small for you andnarrow and dismal""At this moment no.""Can you affirm that you are not bitter at heart because rich and greatpeople forget you""No more questions. I am not anxious to curry favour with rich and greatpeople. I only want means--a position--a career.""Which your own talent and goodness shall win for you. You were made tobe great you shall be great.""Ah You judge me with your heart you should judge me with your head."It was the dark days of the Napoleonic wars when the cloth of the WestRiding was shut out from the markets of the world and ruin threatenedthe manufacturers while the introduction of machinery so reduced thenumbers of the factory hands that desperation was born of misery andfamine.Robert Moore of Hollow's Mill was one of the most unpopular of themill-owners partly because he haughtily declined to conciliate theworking class and partly because of his foreign demeanour for he wasthe son of a Flemish mother had been educated abroad and had only comehome recently to attempt to retrieve by modern trading methods thefallen fortune of the ancient firm of his Yorkshire forefathers.The last trade outrage of the district had been the destruction onStilbro' Moor of the new machines that were being brought by night tohis mill.Caroline Helstone was eighteen years old drawing near the confines of
comment242,illusive dreams. Elf-land behind her the shores of Reality in front. Toherself she said that night after Robert had walked home with her tothe rectory gate "I love Robert and I feel sure that he loves me. Ihave thought so many a time before to-day I felt it."And Robert leaning later on his own yard gate with the hushed darkmill before him exclaimed "This won't do. There's weakness--there'sdownright ruin in all this."For Caroline Helstone was a fatherless and portionless girl entirelydependent on her uncle the vicar of Briarfield._II.--The Master of Hollows Mill_"Come child put away your books. Lock them up Get your bonnet on Iwant you to make a call with me.""With you uncle"Thus the Rev. Matthewson Helstone the imperious little vicar ofBriarfield to his niece who obeyed his unusual request asked wherethey were going."To Fieldhead" replied the Rev. Matthewson Helstone. "We are going tosee Miss Shirley Keeldar.""Miss Keeldar Is she come to Yorkshire""She is and will reside for a time on her property."The Keeldars were the lords of the manor and their property includedthe mill rented by Mr. Robert Moore.The visitors were received at Fieldhead by a middle-aged nervous Englishlady to whom Caroline at once found it natural to talk with a gentleease until Miss Shirley Keeldar entering the room introduced them toMrs. Pryor who she added "was my governess and is still my friend."Shirley Keeldar was no ugly heiress. She was agreeable to the eyegracefully made and her face pale intelligent and of variedexpression also possessed the charm of grace.The interview had not proceeded far before Shirley hoped they wouldoften have the presence of Miss Helstone at Fieldhead a requestrepeated by Mrs. Pryor."You are distinguished more than you think" said Shirley "for Mrs.Pryor often tantalises me by the extreme caution of her judgments. Ihave entreated her to say what she thinks of my gentleman-tenant Mr.Moore but she evades an answer. What are Mr. Moore's politics""Those of a tradesman" returned the rector "narrow selfish andunpatriotic.""He looks a gentleman and it pleases me to think he is such.""And decidedly he is" joined in Caroline in distinct tones."You are his friend at any rate" said Shirley flashing a searchingglance at the speaker."I am both his friend and relative.""I like that romantic Hollow with all my heart--the old mill and thewhite cottage and the counting-house.""And the trade" inquired the rector."Half my income comes from the works in that Hollow.""Don't enter into partnership that's all.""You've put it into my head" she exclaimed with a joyous laugh. "Itwill never get out thank you."Some days later the new friends were walking together towards therectory when the talk turned on the qualities which prove that a man canbe trusted."Do you know what soothsayers I would consult" asked Caroline."Let me hear.""Neither man nor woman elderly nor young the little Irish beggar thatcomes barefoot to my door the mouse that steals out of the cranny inthe wainscot the bird that in frost and snow pecks at the window fora crumb. I know somebody to whose knee the black cat loves to climbagainst whose shoulder and cheek it loves to purr. The old dog alwayscomes out of his kennel and wags his tail when somebody passes.""Is it Robert""It is Robert.""Handsome fellow" said Shirley with enthusiasm. "He is both gracefuland good.""I was sure that you would see that he was. When I first looked at yourface I knew that you would.""I was well inclined to him before I saw him I liked him when I did seehim I admire him now."When they kissed each other and parted at the rectory gate Shirleysaid
comment243,"Caroline Helstone I have never in my whole life been able to talk to ayoung lady as I have talked to you this morning.""This is the worst passage I have come to yet" said Caroline toherself. "Still I was prepared for it. I gave Robert up to Shirley thefirst day I heard she was come."_III.--Caroline Finds a Mother_The Whitsuntide school treats were being held and it was ShirleyKeeldar who at the head of the tea-table kept a place for RobertMoore and whose temper became clouded when he was late. When he didcome he was hard and preoccupied and presently the two girls noticed hewas shaking hands and renewing a broken friendship with a militantrector in the playing field and that the more vigorous of theirmanufacturing neighbours had gathered in a group to talk."There is some mystery afloat" said Shirley. "Some event is expectedsome preparation to be made and Robert's secrecy vexes me. See theyare all shaking hands with emphasis as if ratifying some league.""We must be on the alert" said Caroline "and perhaps we shall find aclue."Later the rector came to them to mention that he would not sleep athome that night and Shirley had better stay with Caroline--arrangementswhich they could not but connect with a glimpse of martial scarlet theyhad observed on a distant moor earlier in the day and the passage by aquiet route of six cavalry soldiers.So the girls sat up that night and watched until close upon midnightthey heard the tramp of hundreds of marching feet. The mob halted by therectory for a muttered consultation and then moved cautiously alongtowards the Hollow's Mill.In vain did the two watchers try to cross to the mill by fenced fieldsand give the alarm. When they reached a point from which they couldoverlook the mill the attack had already begun and the yard-gates werebeing forced. A volley of stones smashed every window but the millremained mute as a mausoleum."He cannot be alone" whispered Caroline."I would stake all I have that he is as little alone as he is alarmed"responded Shirley.Shots were discharged by the rioters. Had the defenders waited for thissignal It seemed so. The inert mill woke and a volley of musketrypealed sharp through the Hollow. It was difficult in the darkness todistinguish what was going on now. The mill yard was full ofbattle-movement there was struggling rushing trampling and shoutingand then the rioters who had never dreamed of encountering an organiseddefence fell back defeated but leaving the premises a blot ofdesolation on the fresh front of the summer dawn.Caroline Helstone now fell into a state of depression and physicalweakness which she tried in vain to combat."It is scarcely living to measure time as I do at the rectory" sheconfessed one day to Mrs. Pryor who had become her instructress andfriend. "The hours pass and I get over them somehow but I do not liveI endure existence but I barely enjoy it. I want to go away from thisplace and forget it.""You know I am at present residing with Miss Keeldar in the capacity ofcompanion" Mrs. Pryor replied. "Should she marry and that she willmarry ere long many circumstances induce me to conclude I shall ceaseto be necessary to her. I possess a small independency arising partlyfrom my own savings and partly from a legacy. Whenever I leave FieldheadI shall take a house of my own. I have no relations to invite to closeintimacy. To you my dear I need not say I am attached. With you I amhappier than I have been with any living thing. You will come to methen Caroline""Indeed I love you" was the reply "and I should like to live withyou.""All I have I would leave to you.""But my dear madam I have no claim on this generosity--"Mrs. Pryor now displayed such agitation that it was Caroline who had tobecome comforter.The sequel to this scene appeared when Caroline sank into so weak a
comment244,state that constant nursing was needed and Mrs. Pryor establishedherself at the rectory.One day when the watchful nurse could not forbear to weep--her fullheart overflowing--her patient asked"Do you think I shall not get better I do not feel very ill--onlyweak.""But your mind Caroline your mind is crushed your heart is brokenyou have been left so desolate.""I sometimes think if an abundant gush of happiness came on me I couldrevive yet.""You love me Caroline""Inexpressibly. I sometimes feel as if I could almost grow to yourheart.""Then if you love me so it will be neither shock nor pain for you toknow that you are my own child.""Mrs. Pryor That is--that means--you have adopted me""It means that I am your true mother.""But Mrs. James Helstone--but my father's wife whom I do not rememberto have seen she is my mother""She is your mother" Mrs. Pryor assured her. "James Helstone was myhusband.""Is what I hear true Is it no dream My own mother And one I can be sofond of If you are my mother the world is all changed to me."The offspring nestled to the parent who gathered her to her bosomcovered her with noiseless kisses and murmured love over her like acushat fostering its young._IV.--An Old Acquaintance_An uncle of Shirley Keeldar Sympson by name now came with his familyto stay at Feidhead and accompanying them as tutor to a crippled sonHarry was Louis Moore Robert's younger brother."Shirley" said Caroline one day as they sat in the summer-house "youare a singular being. I thought I knew you quite well I begin to findmyself mistaken. Did you know that my cousin Louis was tutor in youruncle's family before the Sympsons came down here""Yes of course I knew it well.""How chanced it that you never mentioned it to me" asked Caroline. "Youknew Mrs. Pryor was my mother and were silent and now here again isanother secret.""I never made it a secret you never asked me who Henry's tutor was orI would have told you.""I am puzzled about more things than one in this matter. You don't likepoor Louis--why Do you wish that Robert's brother were more highlyplaced""Robert's brother indeed" was the exclamation in a tone of scorn andwith a movement of proud impatience Shirley snatched a rose from abranch peeping through the open lattice. "Robert's brother Robert's
comment245,brother is a topic on which you and I shall quarrel if we discuss itoften so drop it henceforth and for ever."She would have understood the meaning of that outburst better if she hadheard a conversation in the schoolroom a few days later between LouisMoore and Shirley."For two years" he was saying "I had once a pupil who grew very dearto me. Henry is dear but she was dearer. Henry never gives me troubleshe--well--she did. She spilled the draught from my cup and havingtaken from me my peace of mind and ease of life she took from meherself quite coolly--just as if when she was gone the world would beall the same to me. At the end of two years it fell out that weencountered again. She received me haughtily but then she wasinconsistent she tantalised as before. When I thought of her only as alofty stranger she would suddenly show me a glimpse of lovingsimplicity warm me with such a beam of reviving sympathy that I couldno more shut my heart to her image than I could close that door againsther presence. Explain why she distressed me so.""She could not bear to be quite outcast" was the docile reply.Caroline would have understood still more could she have read what LouisMoore wrote in his diary that night "What a child she is sometimesWhat an unsophisticated untaught thing I worship her perfections butit is her faults or at least her foibles that bring her near to me. IfI were a king and she were a housemaid my eye would recognise herqualities."Robert Moore had long been absent from Briarfield and no one knew whyhe stayed away. It could not be that he was afraid for he had shown theutmost fearlessness in bringing to justice and transportation the fourringleaders in the attack on the mill. He had now returned and one dayas he rode over Rushedge Moore from Stilbro' market with a bluffneighbour he unbosomed himself of the reason why he had remained thuslong from home."I certainly believed she loved me" he said. "I have seen her eyessparkle when she found me out in a crowd. When my name was uttered shechanged countenance I knew she did. She was cordial to me she took aninterest in me she was anxious about me. I saw power in her I owed hergratitude. She aided me substantially and effectively with a loan offive thousand pounds. Could I believe she loved me With an admirationdedicated entirely to myself I smiled at her being the first to love andto show it. That whip of yours seems to have a good heavy handle. Knock
comment246,me out of the saddle with it if you choose for I never felt as ifnature meant her to be my other and better self. Yet I walked up toFieldhead and in a hard firm fashion offered myself--my fine person--with all my debts of course as a settlement. There was nomisunderstanding her aspect and voice as she indignantly ejaculated'God bless me' Her eyes lightened as she said 'You have pained me youhave outraged me you have deceived me. I did respect I did admire Idid like you and you would immolate me to that mill--your Moloch' Iwas obliged to say 'Forgive me' To which she replied 'I could ifthere was not myself to forgive too but to mislead a sagacious man sofar I must have done wrong.' She added 'I am sorry for what hashappened.' So was I God knows."It was after this talk that Moore was shot down by a concealed assassin._V.--Love Scenes_On the very night that Robert Moore arrived at his cottage in theHollow after being nursed back to life in the house of the neighbourwho was with him when he was shot by a fanatical revolutionist hescribbled a note to ask his cousin Caroline to call as was her wontbefore the days of misunderstanding."Caroline you look as if you had heard good tidings" said Robert."What is the source of the sunshine I perceive about you""For one thing I am happy in mamma. I love her more tenderly every day.And I am glad you are better and that we are friends.""Cary I mean to tell you some day a thing about myself that is not tomy credit. I cannot bear that you should think better of me than Ideserve.""But I believe I know all about it. I inferred something gathered morefrom rumour and made out the rest by instinct.""I wanted to marry Shirley for the sake of her money and she refused mescornfully you needn't prick your fingers with your needle that is theplain truth--and I had not an emotion of tenderness for her.""Then Robert it was very wicked in you to want to marry her.""And very mean my little pastor but Cary I had no love to give--noheart that I could call my own."It is Louis who is once more speaking to Shirley in the schoolroom."For the first time Shirley I stand before you--myself. I fling offthe tutor and introduce you to the man. My pupil.""My master" was the low answer."I have to tell you that for five years you have been growing into yourtutor's heart and that you are rooted there now. I have to declare thatyou have bewitched me in spite of sense and experience and differenceof station and estate and that I love you with all my life andstrength.""Dear Louis be faithful to me never leave me. I don't care for lifeunless I pass it at your side." She looked up with a sweet openearnest countenance. "Teach me and help me to be good. Show me how tosustain my part. Your judgment is well-balanced your heart is kind Iknow you are wise. Be my companion through life my guide where I amignorant my master where I am faulty."The Orders in Council are repealed the blockaded ports are thrown openand the ringers in Briarfield belfry crack a bell that remains dissonantto this day. Caroline Helstone is in the garden listening to this callto be gay when a hand steals quietly round her waist."Caroline" says a manly voice. "I have sought you for an audience. Therepeal of the Orders in Council saves me. Now I shall not turn bankruptnow I shall be no longer poor now I can pay my debts now all the clothI have in my warehouses will be taken off my hands. This day lays my
comment247,fortune on a foundation on which for the first time I can securelybuild.""Your heavy difficulties are lifted""They are lifted I breathe I can act. Now I can take more workmengive better wages be less selfish. Now Caroline I can have a homethat is truly mine and seek a wife. Will Caroline forget all I havemade her suffer forget my poor ambition my sordid schemes Will shelet me prove I can love faithfully Is Caroline mine"His hand was in hers still and a gentle pressure answered him"Caroline is yours.""I love you Robert" she said simply and mutely offered a kiss anoffer of which he took unfair advantage.                                   Villette      Villette is Brussels and the experiences of the heroine     Lucy Snowe in travelling thither and teaching there are based     on the journeys and the life of Charlotte Bront when she was     a teacher in the Pensionnat Hger. The principal characters in     the story have been identified more or less completely with     people whom the writer knew. Paul Emanuel resembles M. Hger     in many ways and Madame Beck is a severe portrait of Madame     Hger. Dr. John Graham Bretton is a reflection of George     Smith Charlotte Bront's friendly publisher and Mrs. Bretton     is Mr. Smith's mother. Lucy Snowe is Jane Eyre otherwise     Charlotte Bront placed amidst different surroundings and     Ginevra Fanshawe was sketched from one of the pupils in     Hger's school. The materials used in "Villette" were taken     in part from an earlier work "The Professor" which suffered     rejection nine times at the hands of publishers. Though there     was similarity of scene and in some degree of subject the     two books are in no way identical. "Villette" was published on     January 24 1853 and achieved an immediate success. It was     felt to have more movement and force than "Shirley" and less     of the crudeness that accompanied the strength of "Jane Eyre."_I.--Little Miss Caprice_My godmother lived in a handsome house in the ancient town of Bretton--the widow of Bretton--and there I Lucy Snowe visited her about twice ayear and liked the visit well for time flowed smoothly for me at herside like the gliding of a full river through a verdant plain.During one of my visits I was told that the little daughter of a distantrelation of my godmother was coming to be my companion and well do Iremember the rainy night when outside the opened door we saw the
comment248,servant Waren with a shawled bundle in his arms and a nurse-girl by hisside."Put me down please" said a small voice. "Take off the shawl give itto Harriet and she can put it away."The child who gave these orders was a tiny neat little figure delicateas wax and like a mere doll though she was six years of age.Mrs. Bretton drew the little stranger to her when they had entered thedrawing-room kissed her and asked "What is my little one's name""Polly papa calls her" was the reply."And will Polly be content to live with me""Not always but till papa comes home." Her eyes filled with tears anddrawing away from Mrs. Bretton she added "I can sit on a stool."Her emotion at finding herself among strangers was however onlyexpressed by the tiniest occasional sniff and presently the managinglittle body remarked"Harriet I must be put to bed. Ask if you sleep with me.""No missy" said the nurse "you are to share this young lady'sroom"--designating me."I wish you ma'am good-night" said the little creature to Mrs.Bretton but she passed me mute."Good-night Polly" I said."No need to say good-night since we sleep in the same chamber" was thereply.Paulina Home's father was obliged to travel to recruit his health andher mother being dead Mrs. Bretton had offered to take temporary chargeof the child.During the two months Paulina stayed with us the one member of thehousehold who reconciled her to absence from her father was John GrahamBretton Mrs. Bretton's only child a handsome whimsical youth ofsixteen. He began by treating her with mock seriousness as a person ofconsideration and before long was more than the Grand Turk in herestimation indeed when a letter came from her father on the Continentasking that his little girl might join him there we wondered how shewould take the news. I found her in the drawing-room engaged with apicture-book."Miss Snowe" said she "this is a wonderful book. It was given me byGraham. It tells of distant countries.""Polly" I interrupted "should you like to travel""Not just yet" was the prudent answer "but perhaps when I am grown awoman I may travel with Graham.""But would you like to travel now if your papa was with you""What is the good of talking in that silly way" said she. "What is papato you I was just beginning to be happy."Then I told her of the letter and the tidings kept her serious thewhole day. When Graham came home in the evening she whispered as sheheard him in the hall "Tell him by-and-by tell him I am going."But Graham who was preoccupied about some school prize had to be toldtwice before the news took proper hold of his attention. "Polly going"he said. "What a pity Dear little Mouse I shall be sorry to lose hershe must come to us again."On going to bed I found the child wide awake and in what she called"dreadful misery""Paulina" I said "you should not grieve that Graham does not care for
comment249,you so much as you care for him. It must be so."Her questioning eyes asked why."Because he is a boy and you are a girl he is sixteen and you are onlysix his nature is strong and gay and yours is otherwise.""But I love him so much. He should love me a little.""He does. He is fond of you you are his favourite.""Am I Graham's favourite""Yes more than any little child I know."The assurance soothed her and she smiled in her anguish. As I warmedthe shivering capricious little creature in my arms I wondered how shewould battle with life and bear its shocks repulses and humiliations._II.--Madame Beck's School_The next eight years of my life brought changes. My own household andthat of the Brettons suffered wreck. My friends went abroad and werelost sight of and I after a period of companionship with a woman offortune found myself at her death with fifteen pounds in my pocketlooking for a new place. Then it was that I saw mentally within reachwhat I had never yet beheld with my bodily eyes--I saw London.When I awoke there next morning my spirit shook its always fetteredwings half loose. I had a feeling as if I were at last about to tastelife. In that morning my soul grew as fast as Jonah's gourd. I wanderedwhither chance might lead in a still ecstasy of freedom and enjoyment.That evening I formed a project of crossing to a continental port andfinding a vessel was about to start I joined her at once in the river.When the packet sailed at sunrise I found the only passenger on boardto whom I cared to speak--and who indeed insisted on speaking tome--was a girl of seventeen on her way to school in the city ofVillette. Miss Ginevra Fanshawe carelessly ran on with a full account ofherself her school at Madame Beck's her poverty at home her educationby her godfather De Bassompirre who lived in France her want ofaccomplishments--except that she could talk play and dance--and theneed for her to marry a rather elderly gentleman with cash.It was this irresponsible talk no doubt that led me in the absence ofany other leading to make Villette my destination. On my arrival therean English gentleman young distinguished and handsome observing myinability to make myself understood at the bureau where the diligencestopped inquired kindly if I had any friends in the city and on myreplying that I had not gave me the address of such an inn as I wantedand personally directed me part of the way. Even then however I failedin the gloom to find the inn and was becoming quite exhausted whenover the door of a house loftier by a storey than those around it Isaw a brass plate with the inscription "Pensionnat de Demoiselles"and beneath the name "Madame Beck." Providence said "Stop here thisis your inn." I rang the door-bell."May I see Madame Beck" I inquired of the servant who opened the door.
comment250,As I spoke in English I was admitted without a moment's hesitation.I sat turning hot and cold in a glittering salon for a quarter of anhour and then a voice said "You ayre Engliss"The question came from a motherly dumpy little woman in a large shawla wrapping gown a clean trim nightcap and shod with the shoes ofsilence.As I told my story through a mistress who had been summoned totranslate the speech of Albion I thought the tale won madame's earthough never a gleam of sympathy crossed her countenance. A man's stepwas heard in the vestibule hastily proceeding to the outer door."Who goes out now" demanded Madame Beck listening to the tread."M. Paul Emanuel" replied the teacher."The very man Call him."He entered a small dark and square man in spectacles."_Mon cousin_" began madame "read that countenance."The little man fixed on me his spectacles a gathering of the browsseeming to say that a veil would be no veil to him."Do you need her services" he asked."I could do with them" said Madame Beck."Engage her." And with a _ban soir_ this sudden arbiter of my destinyvanished.Madame Beck possessed high administrative powers. She ruled a hundredand twenty pupils four teachers eight masters six servants and threechildren and managed the pupils' parents and friends to perfectionwithout apparent effort. "Surveillance" "espionage"--these were thewatchwords of her system. She knew what honesty was and liked it--whenit did not obtrude its clumsy scruples in the way of her will andinterest. Wise firm faithless secret crafty passionless watchfuland inscrutable--withal perfectly decorous--what more could be desiredNot a soul in all Madame Beck's house from the scullion to thedirectress herself but was above being ashamed of a lie they thoughtnothing of it.Here Miss Ginevra Fanshawe was a thriving pupil. She had a considerablerange of acquaintances outside the school for Mrs. Cholmondeley herchaperon a gay fashionable lady took her to evening parties at thehouses of her acquaintances. Soon I discovered by hints that ardentadmiration perhaps genuine love was at the command of this pretty andcharming but by no means refined girl. She called her suitor"Isidore" and bragged about the vehemence of his attachment. I askedher if she loved him in return."He is handsome he loves me to distraction and so I am amused" wasthe reply."But if he loves you and it comes to nothing in the end he will bemiserable.""Of course he will break his heart. I should be disappointed if hedidn't.""Do try to get a clear idea of the state of your own mind" I said "forto me it really seems as chaotic as a rag-bag.""It is something in this fashion. He thinks far more of me than I findit convenient to be while I am more at ease with you you old cross-patch you who know me to be coquettish and ignorant and fickle.""You love M. Isidore far more than you think or will avow.""No. I danced with a young officer the other night whom I love athousand times more than he. Colonel Alfred de Hamal suits me farbetter. _Vive les joies et les plaisirs_"It was as English teacher that I was engaged at Madame Beck's schoolbut the annual fte brought me into prominence in another capacity. Theprogramme included a dramatic performance with pupils and teachers foractors and this was given under the superintendence of M. Paul Emanuel.I was dressed a couple of hours before anyone else and reading in myclassroom the door was flung open and in came M. Paul with a burst ofexecrable jargon "Mees play you must I am planted here.""What can I do for you" I inquired."Play you must. I will not have you shrink or frown or make the prude.Let us thrust to the wall all reluctance."What did the little man mean"Listen" he said. "The case shall be stated and you shall answer me'Yes' or 'No.' Louise Vanderkelkov has fallen ill--at least so herridiculous mother asserts. She is charged with a rle without that rle
comment251,the play stopped. Englishwomen are either the best or the worst of theirsex. I apply to an Englishwoman to save me. What is her answer--'Yes'or 'No'"Seeing in his vexed fiery and searching eye an appeal behind itsmenace my lips dropped the word "Oui."His rigid countenance relaxed with a quiver of content then he went on"Here is the book. Here is your rle. You must withdraw." He conveyed meto the attic locked me in and took away the key.What I felt that successful night and what I did I no more expected tofeel and do than to be lifted in a trance to the seventh heaven. A keenrelish for dramatic expression revealed itself as part of my nature. Butthe strength of longing must be put by and I put it by and fastened itin with the lock of a resolution which neither time nor temptation hassince picked.It was at this school fte that I discovered the identity of MissFanshawe's M. Isidore. She whispered to me after the play "Isidore andAlfred de Hamal are both here" The latter I found was a straight-nosedcorrect-featured little dandy nicely dressed curled booted andgloved and Isidore was the manly English Dr. John who attended thepupils of the school and was none other than the gentleman whosedirections to an hotel I had failed to follow on the night of my arrivalin Villette. And the puppet the manikin--a mere lackey for Dr. Johnhis valet his foot-boy was the favoured admirer of Ginevra Fanshawe_III.--Old Friends are Best_During the long vacation I stayed at the school and in the absence ofcompanionship and the sedative of work suffered such agonisingdepression as led to physical illness until one evening afterwandering aimlessly in the city I fell fainting as I tried to reach theporch of a great church. When I recovered consciousness I found myselfin a room that smiled "Auld lang syne" out of every nook.Where was I The furniture was that with which I had been so intimate inthe drawing-room of my godmother's house at Bretton. Nay there on thelinen of my bed were my godmothers initials "L.L.B." and there was theportrait that used to hang over the mantelpiece in the breakfast-room inthe old house at Bretton. I audibly pronounced the name--"Graham""Graham" echoed a sudden voice at my bedside. "Do you want Graham"She was little changed something sterner something more robust but itwas my godmother Mrs. Bretton."How was I found madam""My son shall tell you by and by" said she. "I am told you are anEnglish teacher in a foreign school here."Before evening I was downstairs and seated in a corner when Grahamarrived home and entered with the question "How is your patientmamma"At Mrs. Bretton's invitation I came forward to speak for myself wherehe stood at the hearth a figure justifying his mother's pride."Much better" I said calmly "much better I thank you Dr. John."For this tall young man this host of mine was Dr. John and I had beenaware of his identity for some time.Ere we had sat ten minutes I caught the eye of Mrs. Bretton fixedsteadily on me and at last she asked "Tell me Graham of whom doesthis young lady remind you.""Dr. John has had so much to do and think of" said I seeing how itmust end "that it never occurred to me as possible that he shouldrecognise Lucy Snowe.""Lucy Snowe I thought so I knew it" cried Mrs. Bretton as shestepped across the hearth and kissed me. And I wondered if Mrs. Brettonknew at whose feet her idolised son had laid his homage._IV.--A Cure for First Love_The Brettons who had regained some of their fortune lived in a chteauoutside Villette a course further warranted by Dr. John's professionalsuccess. In the months that followed I heard much of Ginevra. Hethought her so fair so good so innocent and yet though love isblind I saw sometimes a subtle ray sped sideways from his eye that half
comment252,led me to think his professed persuasion of Miss Fanshawe's navet wasin part assumed.One morning my godmother decreed that we should go with Graham to aconcert that night at which the most advanced pupils of theconservatoire were to perform. There in the suite of the Britishembassy was Ginevra Fanshawe seated by the daughter of an Englishpeer. I noticed that she looked quite steadily at Dr. John and thenraised a glass to examine his mother and a minute or two afterwardslaughingly whispered to her neighbour."Miss Fanshawe is here" I whispered. "Have you noticed her""Oh yes" was the reply "and I happen to know her companion who is aproud girl but not in the least insolent and I doubt whether Ginevrawill have gained ground in her estimation by making a butt of herneighbours.""What neighbours""Myself and my mother. As for me it is very natural but my mother Inever saw her ridiculed before. Through me she could not in ten yearshave done what in a moment she has done through my mother."Never before had I seen so much fire and so little sunshine in Dr.John's blue eyes."My mother shall not be ridiculed with my consent or without my scorn"he added. "Mother" said he to her later "You are better to me than tenwives." And when we were out in the keen night air he said to himself"Thank you Miss Fanshawe. I am glad you laughed at my mother. Thatsneer did me a world of good."_V.--Reunion Completed_One evening in December Dr. Bretton called to take me to the theatre inplace of his mother who had been prevented by an arrival. In the courseof the performance a cry of "Fire" rang out and a panic ensued. Grahamremained quite cool until he saw a young girl struck from herprotector's arms and hurled under the feet of the crowd. Then he rushedforward thrust back the throng with the assistance of the gentleman--apowerful man though grey-haired--and bore the girl into the freshnight I following him closely."She is very light" he said "like a child.""I am not a child I am a person of seventeen" responded his burdendemurely.Her father's carriage drove up and Graham having introduced himself asan English doctor we drove to the hotel where father and daughter werestaying in handsome apartments. The injuries were not dangerous and thefather after earnestly expressing his obligations to Graham asked himto call the next day.When next I visited the Bretton's chteau I found an intruder in the
comment253,room I had occupied during my illness."Miss de Bassompirre I pronounced recognising the rescued lady whosename I had heard on the night of the accident."No" was the reply. "Not Miss de Bassompirre to you." Then as Iseemed at fault she added "You have forgotten then that I have saton your knee been lifted in your arms even shared your pillow. I amPaulina Mary Home de Bassompirre."I often visited Mary de Bassompirre with pleasure. That young lady haddifferent moods for different people. With her father she was even now achild. With me she was serious and womanly. With Mrs. Bretton she wasdocile and reliant. With Graham she was shy--very shy. At moments shetried to be cold and on occasion she endeavoured to shun him. Evenher father noticed this demeanour in her and asked her what her oldfriend had done."Nothing" she replied "but we are grown strange to each other."I became apprised of the return of M. de Bassompirre and Paulina aftera few weeks' absence in Paris by seeing them riding before me in aquiet boulevard with Dr. Bretton. How animated was Graham's face Howtrue yet how retiring the joy it expressed They parted. He passed meat speed hardly feeling the earth he skimmed and seeing nothing oneither hand.It was after this that she made me her confession of love and of fearlest her father should be grieved."I wish papa knew I do wish papa knew" began now to be her anxiousmurmur but it was M. de Bassompirre who first broached the subject ofhis daughter's affections and it was to me that he introduced it. Shecame into the room while we talked and Graham followed."Take her John Bretton" he said "and may God deal with you as youdeal with her"_VI.--A Professor's Love-Story_The pupils from the schools of the city were assembled for the yearlyprize distribution--a ceremony followed by an oration from one of theprofessors. I think I was glad when M. Paul appeared behind the crimsondesk fierce and frank dark and candid testy and fearless for then Iknew that neither formalism nor flattery would be the doom of theaudience.On Monsieur's birthday it was the habit of the scholars to present himwith flowers and I had worked a beaded watch-chain and enclosed it ina sparkling shell-box with his initials graved on the lid. He entered
comment254,that day in a mood that made him as good as a sunbeam and each pupilpresented her bouquet till he was hidden at his desk behind a pile offlowers. I waited. Then he demanded thrice in tragic tones "Is thatall" The effect was ludicrous and the time for my presentation hadpassed. Thereupon he fell with furious abuse upon the English andparticularly English women. But I presented the chain to him later andthat day closed for us both with a wordless content so full was he offriendliness.The professor's care for me took curious forms. He haunted my desk withunseen gift-bringing--the newest books the correction of exercises theconcealment of bonbons of which he was fond.One day he asked me whether if I were his sister I should always becontent to stay with a brother such as he. I said I believed I should.He continued "If I were to go beyond seas for two or three yearsshould you welcome me on my return""Monsieur how could I live in the interval" was my reply.The explanation of that question soon came. He had it seemed to sailto Basseterre in Guadeloupe to attend to a friend's businessinterests. For what I felt there was no help and how could I helpfeelingOf late he had spent hours with me with temper soothed with eyecontent with manner home-like and mild. The mutual understanding wassettling and fixing. And when the time came for him to say good-bye werambled forth into the city. He talked of his voyage. What did I proposeto do in his absence He did not like leaving me at Madame Beck's--Ishould be so desolate.We were now returning from our walk when passing a small but pleasantand neat abode in a clean _faubourg_ he took a key from his pocketopened and entered. "_Voici_" he cried and put a prospectus in myhand. "Externat de demoiselles. Numro 7 Faubourg Clotilde. DirectriceMademoiselle Lucy Snowe.""Now" said he "you shall live here and have a school. You shall employyourself while I am away you shall think of me you shall mind yourhealth and happiness for my sake and when I come back----"I touched his hand with my lips. Royal to me had been its bounty.And now three years are past. M. Emanuel's return is fixed. He is to bewith me ere the mists of November come. My school flourishes my houseis ready.But the skies hang full and dark--a wrack sails from the west. Peacepeace Banshee--"keening" at every window.

Leave sunnyimaginations hope. Let them picture union and a happy life.                                   EMILY BRONTWuthering Heights      "That chainless soul" Emily Jane Bront was born at     Thornton Yorkshire England on August 30 1818 and died at     Haworth on December 19 1848. She will always have a place in     English literature by reason of her one weird powerful
comment255,     strained novel "Wuthering Heights" and a few poems. Emily     Bront like her sister Charlotte was educated at Cowan     School and at Brussels. For a time she became a governess but     it seemed impossible for her to live away from the fascination     of the Yorkshire moors and she went home to keep house at the     Haworth Parsonage while her sisters taught. Two months after     the publication of "Jane Eyre" by Charlotte that is in     December 1847 "Wuthering Heights" by Emily and "Agnes     Grey" by Anne the third sister in this remarkable trio were     issued in one volume. The critics who did not discover these     books were by women suggested persistently that "Wuthering     Heights" must be an immature work by Currer Bell Charlotte.     A year after the publication of her novel Emily died unaware     of her success in achieving a lasting if restricted fame.     She was extraordinarily reserved sensitive and wayward and     lived in an imagined world of her own morbidly influenced no     doubt by the vagaries of her worthless brother Branwell. That     she had true genius allied with fine strength of intellect     and character is the unanimous verdict of competent     criticism while it grieves over unfulfilled possibilities._I.--A Surly Brood_"Mr. Heathcliff"A nod was the answer."Mr. Lockwood your new tenant at Thrushcross Grange sir.""Walk in." But the invitation uttered with closed teeth expressed thesentiment "Go to the deuce" And it was not till my horse's breastfairly pushed the barrier that he put out his hand to unchain it. I feltinterested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myselfas he preceded me up the causeway calling "Joseph take Mr. Lockwood'shorse and bring up some wine."Joseph was an old man very old though hale and sinewy. "The Lord helpus" he soliloquised in an undertone as he relieved me of my horse.Wuthering Heights Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling is a farmhouse on anexposed and stormy edge its name being significant of atmospherictumult. Its owner is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect in dress andmanners a gentleman with erect and handsome figure but morosedemeanour. One step from the outside brought us into the familyliving-room the recesses of which were haunted by a huge liver-colouredbitch pointer with a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs. As thebitch sneaked wolfishly to the back of my legs I attempted to caressher an action that provoked a long guttural growl."You'd better let the dog alone" growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison ashe checked her with a punch of his foot. "She's not accustomed to bespoiled."As Joseph was mumbling indistinctly in the depths of the cellar andgave no sign of ascending his master dived down to him leaving me_vis--vis_ with the ruffianly bitch and half a dozen four-footed fiendsthat suddenly broke into a fury while I parried off the attack with apoker and called aloud for assistance."What the devil is the matter" asked Heathcliff as he returned.
comment256,"What the devil indeed" I muttered. "You might as well leave astranger with a brood of tigers""They won't meddle with persons who touch nothing" he remarked. "Thedogs are right to be vigilant. Take a glass of wine."Before I went home I determined to volunteer another visit to my sulkylandlord though evidently he wished for no repetition of my intrusion.                                   Yesterday I again visited Wuthering Heights my nearest neighbours toThrushcross Grange. On that bleak hill-top the earth was hard with ablack frost and the air made me shiver through every limb. As I knockedfor admittance till my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled vinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn andshouted to me."What are ye for T' maister's down i' t' fowld. There's nobbut t'missis. I'll hae no hend wi't" muttered the head vanishing.Then a young man without coat and shouldering a pitchfork hailed me tofollow him and showed me into the apartment where I had been formerlyreceived with a gruff "Sit down he'll be in soon."In the room sat the "missis" motionless and mute. She was slenderscarcely past girlhood with the most exquisite little face I have everhad the pleasure of beholding and her eyes had they been agreeable inexpression would have been irresistible. But the only sentiment theyevinced hovered between scorn and a kind of desperation. As for theyoung man who had brought me in he slung on his person a shabby jacketand erecting himself before the fire gazed down on me from the cornerof his eyes as if there was some mortal feud unavenged between us. Theentrance of Heathcliff relieved me from an uncomfortable state.I found in the course of the tea which followed that the lady was thewidow of Heathcliff's son and that the rustic youth who sat down to themeal with us was Hareton Earnshaw. Now before passing the threshold Ihad noticed over the principal door among a wilderness of crumblinggriffins and shameless little boys the name "Hareton Earnshaw" and thedate "1500." Evidently the place had a history.The snow had fallen so deeply since I entered the house that returnacross the moor in the dusk was impossible.Spending that night at Wuthering Heights on an old-fashioned couch thatfilled a recess or closet in a disused chamber I found scratched onthe paint many times the names "Catherine Earnshaw" "CatherineHeathcliff" and again "Catherine Linton." There were many books in theroom in a dilapidated state and being unable to sleep I examinedthem. Some of them bore the inscription "Catherine Earnshaw her book"and on the blank leaves and margins scrawled in a childish hand was aregular diary. I read "Hindley is detestable. Heathcliff and I aregoing to rebel.... How little did I dream Hindley would ever make me cry
comment257,so Poor Heathcliff Hindley calls him a vagabond and won't let him sitor eat with us any more."When I slept I was harrowed by nightmare and next morning I gladly leftthe house and piloted by my landlord across the billowy white ocean ofthe moor I reached the Grange benumbed with cold and as feeble as akitten from fatigue.When my housekeeper Mrs. Nelly Dean brought in my supper that night Iasked her why Heathcliff let the Grange and preferred living in aresidence so much inferior."He's rich enough to live in a finer house than this" said Mrs. Dean"but he's very close-handed. Young Mrs. Heathcliff is my late master'sdaughter--Catherine Linton was her maiden name and I nursed her poorthing. Hareton Earnshaw is her cousin and the last of an old family.""The master Heathcliff must have had some ups and downs to make himsuch a churl. Do you know anything of his history""It's a cuckoo's sir. I know all about it except where he was bornand who were his parents and how he got his money. And Hareton Earnshawhas been cast out like an unfledged dunnock."I asked Mrs. Dean to bring her sewing and continue the story. This shedid evidently pleased to find me companionable._II.--The Story Runs Backward_Before I came to live here began Mrs. Dean I was almost always atWuthering Heights because my mother nursed Mr. Hindley Earnshaw thatwas Hareton's father and I used to run errands and play with thechildren. One day old Mr. Earnshaw Hareton's grandfather went toLiverpool and promised Hindley and Cathy his son and daughter tobring each of them a present. He was absent three days and at the endof that time brought home bundled up in his arms under his great-coata dirty ragged black-haired child big enough both to walk and talkbut only able to talk gibberish nobody could understand. He had pickedit up he said starving and homeless in the streets of Liverpool. Mrs.Earnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors but Mr. Earnshaw told herto wash it give it clean things and let it sleep with the children.The children's presents were forgotten. This was how Heathcliff as theycalled him came to Wuthering Heights.Miss Cathy and he soon became very thick but Hindley hated him. He wasa patient sullen child who would stand blows without winking orshedding a tear. From the beginning he bred bad feeling in the house.Old Earnshaw took to him strangely and Hindley regarded him as havingusurped his father's affections. As for Heathcliff he was insensible tokindness. Cathy a wild slip with the bonniest eye the sweetest smileand the lightest foot in the parish was much too fond of Heathcliff.Old Mr. Earnshaw died quietly in his chair by the fireside one October
comment258,evening.Mr. Hindley who had been to college came home to the funeral and setthe neighbours gossiping right and left for he brought a wife with him.What she was and where she was born he never informed us. She evinced adislike to Heathcliff and drove him to the company of the servants butCathy clung to him and the two promised to grow up together as rude assavages. Once Hindley shut them out for the night and they came toThrushcross Grange where the Lintons took Cathy in but would not haveanything to do with Heathcliff the Spanish castaway as they calledhim. She stayed five weeks with the Lintons and became very friendlywith the children Edgar and Isabella and when she came back was adignified little person and quite a beauty.Soon after Hindley's son Hareton was born the mother died and thechild fell wholly into my hands for the father grew desperate in hissorrow and gave himself up to reckless dissipation. His treatment ofHeathcliff now was enough to make a fiend of a saint and daily the ladbecame more savagely sullen. I could not half-tell what an infernalhouse we had till at last nobody decent came near us except that EdgarLinton called to see Cathy who at fifteen was the queen of thecountryside--a haughty and headstrong creature.One day after Edgar Linton had been over from the Grange Cathy cameinto the kitchen to me and said "Nelly will you keep a secret for meTo-day Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him and I've given him ananswer. I accepted him Nelly. Be quick and say whether I was wrong.""First and foremost" I said sententiously "do you love Mr. Edgar""I love the ground under his feet and the air over his head andeverything he touches and every word he says. I love his looks and allhis actions and him entirely and altogether. There now""Then" said I "all seems smooth and easy. Where is the obstacle""Here and here" replied Catherine striking one hand on her foreheadand the other on her breast. "In my soul and in my heart I'm convincedI'm wrong I've no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to bein heaven and if the wicked man in there my brother had not brought
comment259,Heathcliff so low I shouldn't have thought of it. It would degrade me tomarry Heathcliff now so he shall never know how I love him and thatnot because he's handsome Nelly but because he's more myself than Iam. Whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same andLinton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning or frost fromfire. Nelly I dreamed I was in heaven but heaven did not seem to be myhome and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth and theangels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heathon the top of Wuthering Heights where I woke sobbing for joy."Ere this speech was ended Heathcliff who had been lying out of sighton a bench by the kitchen wall stole out. He had heard Catherine say itwould degrade her to marry him and he had heard no further.That night while a storm rattled over the heights in full furyHeathcliff disappeared. Catherine suffered uncontrollable grief andbecame dangerously ill. When she was convalescent she went toThrushcross Grange. But Edgar Linton when he married her three yearssubsequent to his father's death and brought her here to the Grangewas the happiest man alive. I accompanied her leaving little Haretonwho was now nearly five years old and had just begun to learn hisletters.On a mellow evening in September I was coming from the garden with abasket of apples I had been gathering when as I approached the kitchendoor I heard a voice say "Nelly is that you"Something stirred in the porch and moving nearer I saw a tall mandressed in dark clothes with dark hair and face."What" I cried "you come back""Yes Nelly. You needn't be so disturbed. I want one word with yourmistress."I went in and explained to Mr. Edgar and Catherine who was waitingbelow."Oh Edgar darling" she panted flinging her arms round his neck"Heathcliff's come back--he is""Well well" he said "don't strangle me for that. There's no need tobe frantic. Try to be glad without being absurd"When Heathcliff came in she seized his hands and laughed like onebeside herself.It seemed that he was staying at Wuthering Heights invited by Mr.Earnshaw When I heard this I had a presentiment that he had better haveremained away.Later we learned from Joseph that Heathcliff had called on Earnshawwhom he found sitting at cards had joined in the play and seemingplentifully supplied with money had been asked by his ancientpersecutor to come again in the evening. He then offered liberal paymentfor permission to lodge at the Heights which Earnshaw's covetousnessmade him accept.Heathcliff now commenced visiting Thrushcross Grange and graduallyestablished his right to be expected. A new source of trouble sprang upin an unexpected form--Isabella Linton evincing a sudden andirresistible attraction towards Heathcliff. At that time she was a
comment260,charming young lady of eighteen. I tried to persuade her to banish himfrom her thoughts."He's a bird of bad omen miss" I said "and no mate for you. How hashe been living How has he got rich Why is he staying at WutheringHeights in the house of the man whom he abhors They say Mr. Earnshaw isworse and worse since he came. They sit up all night togethercontinually and Hindley has been borrowing money on his land and doesnothing but play and drink.""You are leagued with the rest" she replied "and I'll not listen toyour slanders." The antipathy of Mr. Linton towards Heathcliff reached apoint at last at which he called on his servants one day to turn him outof the Grange whereupon Heathcliff's revenge took the form of anelopement with Linton's sister. Six weeks later I received a letter ofbitter regret from Isabella asking me distractedly whether I thoughther husband was a man or a devil and how I had preserved the commonsympathies of human nature at Wuthering Heights where they hadreturned.On receiving this letter I obtained permission from Mr. Linton to go tothe Heights to see his sister and Heathcliff on meeting me urged meto secure for him an interview with Catherine."Nelly" said he "you know as well as I do that for every thought shespends on Linton she spends a thousand on me. If he loved her with allthe powers of his puny being he couldn't love as much in eighty yearsas I could in a day. And Catherine has a heart as deep as I have. Thesea could be as readily contained in that horse-trough as her wholeaffection be monopolised by him."Well I argued and refused but in the long run he forced me to agreeto put a missive into Mrs. Linton's hand.When he met her I saw that he could hardly bear for downright agonyto look into her face for he was stricken with the conviction that shewas fated to die."Oh Cathy how can I bear it" was the first sentence he uttered."You and Edgar have broken my heart Heathcliff" was her reply. "Youhave killed me and thriven on it I think.""Are you possessed with a devil" he asked "to talk in that manner tome when you are dying You know you lie to say I have killed you andyou know that I could as soon forget my existence as forget you. Is itnot sufficient that while you are at peace I shall be in the tormentsof hell""I shall not be at peace" moaned Catherine."Why did you despise me Why did you betray your own heart You lovedme. What right had you to leave me""Let me alone" sobbed Catherine. "I've done wrong and I'm dying forit Forgive me"That night was born the Catherine you Mr. Lockwood saw at the Heightsand her mother's spirit was at home with God.When in the morning I told Heathcliff who had been watching near allnight he dashed his head against the knotted trunk of the tree by whichhe stood and howled not like a man but like a savage beast as hebesought her ghost to haunt him. "Be with me always--take any form" hecried. "Only do not leave me in this abyss where I cannot find you"Life with Heathcliff becoming impossible to Isabella she left theneighbourhood never to revisit it and lived near London and there herson whom she christened Linton was born a few months after her escape.He was an ailing peevish creature. When Linton was twelve or a littlemore and Catherine thirteen Isabella died and the boy was brought toThrushcross Grange. Hindley Earnshaw drank himself to death about thesame time after mortgaging every yard of his land for cash andHeathcliff was the mortgagee. So Hareton Earnshaw who should have beenthe first gentleman in the neighbourhood was reduced to dependence onhis father's enemy in whose house he lived ignorant that he had beenwronged.
comment261,The motives of Heathcliff now became clear. Under the influence of apassionate but calculating revenge allied with greed he was planningthe destruction of the Earnshaw family and the union of the WutheringHeights and Thrushcross Grange estates. To this end having brought hisweakly son home to the Heights and terrorised him into a pitiableslavery he schemed a marriage between him and young Catherine Lintonwho was induced to accept the arrangement through sympathy with hercousin and the hope of removing him from the paralysing influence ofhis father. The marriage was almost immediately followed by the death ofboth Catherine's father and her boyish husband who it was afterwardsfound had been coaxed or threatened into bequeathing all his propertyto his father. Thus ended Mrs. Dean's story of how the strangelyassorted occupants of Wuthering Heights had come together my landlordHeathcliff the disinherited poor Hareton Earnshaw and CatherineHeathcliff who had been Catherine Linton and the daughter of CatherineEarnshaw. I propose riding over to Wuthering Heights to inform mylandlord that I shall spend the next six months in London and that hemay look out for another tenant for the Grange._III.--The Story Runs Forward_Yesterday was bright calm and frosty and I went to the Heights as Iproposed. My housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her toher young lady and I did not refuse for the worthy woman was notconscious of anything odd in her request. Hareton Earnshaw unchained thegate for me. The fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen but hedoes his best apparently to make the least of his advantages.Catherine who was preparing vegetables for a meal looked more sulkyand less spirited than when I had seen her first."She does not seem so amiable" I thought "as Mrs. Dean would persuademe to believe. She's a beauty it is true but not an angel."I approached her pretending to desire a view of the garden and droppedMrs. Dean's note on her knee unnoticed by Hareton. But she asked aloud"What is that" and chucked it off."A letter from your old acquaintance the housekeeper at the Grange" Ianswered. She would gladly have gathered it up at this information butHareton beat her. He seized and put it in his waistcoat saying Mr.Heathcliff should look at it first but later he pulled out the letter
comment262,and flung it on the floor as ungraciously as he could. Catherine perusedit eagerly and then asked "Does Ellen like you""Yes very well" I replied hesitatingly.Whereupon she became more communicative and told me how dull she wasnow Heathcliff had taken her books away.When Heathcliff came in looking restless and anxious he sent her tothe kitchen to get her dinner with Joseph and with the master of thehouse grim and saturnine and Hareton absolutely dumb I made acheerless meal and bade adieu early.                                   Next September when going north for shooting a sudden impulse seizedme to visit Thrushcross Grange and pass a night under my own roof forthe tenancy had not yet expired. When I reached the Grange before sunsetI found a girl knitting under the porch and an old woman reclining onthe house-steps smoking a meditative pipe."Is Mrs. Dean within" I demanded."Mistress Dean Nay" she answered. "She doesn't bide here shoo's up atth' Heights.""Are you housekeeper then""Eea aw keep th' house" she replied."Well I'm Mr. Lockwood the master. Are there any rooms to lodge me inI wonder I wish to stay all night.""T' maister" she cried in astonishment. "Yah sud ha' sent word. They'snowt norther dry nor mensful abaht t' place"Leaving her scurrying about making preparations I climbed the stonyby-road that branches off to Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling. On reaching it Ihad neither to climb the gate nor to knock--it yielded to my hand. "Thisis an improvement" I thought. I noticed too a fragrance of flowerswafted on the air from among the homely fruit-trees."Con-_trary_" said a voice as sweet as a silver bell "That for thethird time you dunce I'm not going to tell you again.""Contrary then" answered another in deep but softened tones. "And nowkiss me for minding so well."The male speaker was a young man respectably dressed and seated at atable having a book before him. His handsome features glowed withpleasure and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the page to asmall white hand over his shoulder. So not to interrupt HaretonEarnshaw and Catherine Heathcliff I went round to the kitchen where myold friend Nelly Dean sat sewing and singing a song.Mrs. Dean jumped to her feet as she recognised me. "Why bless you Mr.Lockwood" she exclaimed. "Pray step in Have you walked fromGimmerton""No from the Grange" I replied "and while they make me a lodging roomthere I want to finish my business with your master.""What business sir" said Nelly."About the rent" I answered."Oh then it is Catherine you must settle with or rather me as she hasnot learned to arrange her affairs yet."I looked surprised."Ah You have not heard of Heathcliff's death I see" she continued."Heathcliff dead" I exclaimed. "How long ago""Three months since but sit down and I'll tell you all about it.""I was summoned to Wuthering Heights" she said "within a fortnight ofyour leaving us and I went gladly for Catherine's sake. Mr. Heathcliffwho grew more and more disinclined to society almost banished Earnshawfrom his apartment and was tired of seeing Catherine--that was thereason why I was sent for--and the two young people were thrown perforcemuch in each other's company in the house and presently Catherine began
comment263,to make it clear to her obstinate cousin that she wished to be friends.The intimacy ripened rapidly and Mr. Lockwood on their wedding daythere won't be a happier woman in England than myself. Joseph was theonly objector and he appealed to Heathcliff against 'yon flaysomegraceless quean that's witched our lad wi' her bold een and her forradways.' But after a burst of passion at the news Mr. Heathcliff suddenlycalmed down and said to me 'Nelly there is a strange changeapproaching I'm in its shadow.'"Soon after that he took to wandering alone in a state approachingdistraction. He could not rest he could not eat and he would not seethe doctor. One morning as I walked round the house I observed themaster's window swinging open and the rain driving straight in. 'Hecannot be in bed' I thought 'those showers would drench him through.'And so it was for when I entered the chamber his face and throat werewashed with rain the bed-clothes dripped and he was perfectlystill--dead and stark. I called up Joseph. 'Eh what a wicked 'un helooks girning at death' exclaimed the old man and then he fell on hisknees and returned thanks that the ancient Earnshaw stock were restoredto their rights."I shall be glad when they leave the Heights for the Grange" concludedMrs. Dean."They are going to the Grange then""Yes as soon as they are married and that will be on New Year's Day."                                   ROBERT BUCHANANThe Shadow of the Sword      Robert Buchanan poet novelist and playwright was born on     Aug. 18 1841 at Caverswall Staffordshire England the son     of a poor journeyman tailor from Ayrshire in Scotland who     wrote poetry and wandered about the country preaching     socialism of the Owen type afterwards editing a Glasgow     journal. Owing perhaps in part to his very unconventional     training Robert Buchanan entered on life with a strange     freshness of vision. Nothing in ordinary human life seemed     common or mean to him and this sense of wonder combined with     a power of judgment much steadier than his father's made him     a poet of considerable genius. "Undertones" published in     1863 and "Idylls and Legends of Inverburn" which appeared     two years later made him famous. The same qualities which he     displayed in his poetry Buchanan exhibited in his earliest and     best novels. "The Shadow of the Sword" published in 1876 was     originally conceived as a poem and it still remains one of     the best of modern English prose romances. In his latter years     Robert Buchanan tortured by the long and painful illness of     his beautiful and gentle wife wrote a considerable amount of     work with no literary merit but this does not diminish the     value of his best and earliest work which undoubtedly     entitles him to a place of importance in English literature.     He died on June 10 1901._I.--The King of the Conscripts_"Rohan Gwenfern" cried the sergeant in a voice that rang like atrumpet through the length of the town hall.No one answered. The crowd of young Kromlaix men looked at each other inconsternation. Was the handsomest the strongest and the most daringlad in their village a coward It was the dark year of 1813 whenNapoleon was draining France of all its manhood. Even the only sons ofpoor widowed women such as Rohan Gwenfern was were no longer exemptedfrom conscription. Having lost half a million men amid the snows ofRussia Napoleon had called for 200000 more soldiers and the littleBreton fishing village of Kromlaix had to provide twenty-five recruits."Rohan Gwenfern" cried the sergeant again.The mayor rose up behind the ballot-box on the large table about whichthe villagers were gathered and looked around in vain for the splendidfigure of the young fisherman."Where is your nephew" he said to Corporal Derval in an angry voice.Derval one of Napoleon's veterans who had been pensioned after losinghis leg at Austerlitz looked at his pretty niece Marcelle with astrange pallor on his furrowed sunburnt face.
comment264,"Rohan was too ill to come" said Marcelle with a troubled look in hersweet grey eyes. "I will draw in his name.""Very well my pretty lass" said the mayor his grim face softeninginto a smile as he looked at the beautiful girl "you shall draw forhim and bring him luck."Marcelle's hand trembled as she put it into the ballot-box. She let itstay there so long that some of the soldiers began to laugh. But thevillage women gathered in a dense crowd at the back of the hall gazedat her with tears in their eyes. They knew what she was doing. She waspraying that she might draw a lucky number for her lover Rohan.Twenty-five conscripts were wanted and those who drew a paper numberedtwenty-six or upwards were free."Come come my dear" said the mayor stroking his moustache andnodding encouragingly at Marcelle.She slowly drew forth a paper and handed it to her uncle who openedit read it with a stare and uttered his usual expletive. "Soul of acrow" in an awstricken whisper."Read it corporal" said the mayor while Marcelle looked wildly at heruncle."It is incredible" said Corporal Derval handing the paper to thesergeant with the look of amazement still on his face."Rohan Gwenfern--one" shouted the sergeant while Marcelle clung to heruncle and hid her face upon his arm.Rohan Gwenfern who had taken a solemn oath that he would never go forthto slay his fellow-men at the bidding of Napoleon whom he regarded as ahorrible murderous monster found himself when he returned to Kromlaixlate that evening in the sorry position of King of the Conscripts. Hewas a young man who had led a very solitary life but solitude insteadof making him morbid had strengthened his natural feelings of pity andaffection. His immense physical strength had never been exerted for anyevil and even in the roughest wrestling matches he had never foughtbrutally or cruelly.He certainly rejoiced in his splendid powers of body but he had thegentleness of soul of a poetic mind as well as the magnanimity thatoften goes with great strength. There was indeed something lion-likeabout him as he strode up to the door of his cottage with his mane ofyellow hair floating over his broad brows and falling on his shoulders.An eager crowd was waiting for him and when he appeared they allshouted."Here he is at last" cried a voice which he recognised as that ofMikel Grallon. "Three cheers for the King of the Conscripts"Some bag-pipe players struck up a merry tune but Rohan with a wildface and stern eyes pushed his way through the throng into his cottage.On a seat by the fire his mother sat weeping her face covered with herapron round her was a band of sympathising friends. The scene explained
comment265,itself in one flash and Rohan Gwenfern knew his fate. Pale as death herushed across the floor to his mother's side just as a troop of younggirls flocked into the house singing the Marseillaise. At their head wasMarcelle.A hard struggle had gone on in the heart of Rohan's sweetheart. She hadbeen overcome with grief when she drew the fatal number. But her dismayhad quickly turned into an heroic pride at the thought of her loverbecoming a soldier of Napoleon. From her childhood she had learnt fromher uncle to admire and worship the great emperor who had led the armiesof France from victory to victory and she did not think that Rohanwould refuse to follow him. It is true that she had often heard Gwenfernsay that he loathed war but many other men of Kromlaix had said thesame thing and yet when the hour came and they were called to servein the Grand Army they had obeyed."Look Rohan" she cried holding up in her hand a rosette with a longcoloured streamer. "Look I have brought this for you."Each of the conscripts wore a similar badge and old Corporal Derval hadstuck one on his own breast. All the crowd cheered as Marcelle advancedwith bright eyes and flaming cheeks to her sweetheart."Keep back Do not touch me" cried Rohan his face blazing with strangeanger."The boy's mad" exclaimed Corporal Derval in an angry voice."Do you not understand Rohan" exclaimed Marcelle terrified by herlover's look. "As you did not come someone had to draw in your name. Idid so and you are now the King of the Conscripts and this is yourbadge. Let me fasten it upon your breast"In a moment her soft fingers attached the rosette to his jacket. Rohandid not stir his eyes were fixed on the ground but his features workedconvulsively."Forward now all of you to the inn" said Corporal Derval when thecheering was over. "We will drink the health of Number One"As everybody was moving towards the door Rohan started as if from atrance."Stay" he shouted.All stood listening and his widowed mother crept up and clasped hishand."You are all mad" he said in a wild voice "and I seem to be goingmad too. What is this you tell me about a conscription and an emperorI do not understand. I only know you are all mad. Napoleon has no rightto compel me to fight for him and if every Frenchman had my heart hewould not reign another day. I refuse to be led like a sheep to theslaughter. He can kill me if he wills but he cannot force me to kill myfellow-men. You can go if you like and do his bloody work. Had I the
comment266,power I would serve him as I serve this badge of his"Tearing the rosette from his breast he cast it into the flaming fire."Rohan for God's sake be silent" cried Marcelle. "You speak like amadman. It is all my fault. I thought I should bring you good luck bydrawing for you. Won't you forgive me"The young fisherman looked sadly into his sweetheart's face and when hesaw her wet eyes and quivering lips his heart was stirred. He took herhand and kissed it but suddenly an ill-favoured face was thrust forwardbetween the two lovers."Isn't it a pity" sneered Mikel Grallon "to see a pretty girl wastingherself on a coward when----"He did not complete the sentence for Rohan stretched out his hand andsmote him down. Grallon fell like a log.A wild cry arose from all the men the women screamed even Marcelleshrank back and Rohan strode to the door pushing his way out."Hold him Kill him" shouted some."Arrest him" cried Corporal Derval.Rohan hurled his opponents right and left like so many ninepins. Theyfell back and gasped. Then turning his white face for an instant onMarcelle her lover passed unmolested out into the darkness._II.--In the Cathedral of the Sea_Along the wild rugged shore a little way from Kromlaix was an immensecavern of crimson granite hung with gleaming moss and washed by theroaring tides of the sea. Its towering walls had been carved by wind andwater into thousands of beautiful fantastical forms and a dimreligious light fell from above through a long funnel-shaped holerunning from the roof of the cavern to the top of the great cliff.It was here that Rohan Gwenfern hid from the band of soldiers sent inpursuit of him. The air was damp and chill but he breathed it with thecomfort of a hardy animal. He made a bed of dry seaweed on the top ofthe precipice leading to the hole in the cliff where his mother cameand lowered food to him every evening and Jannedik a pet goat thatused to follow him everywhere in the days when he was a free man washis only companion. Strange and solitary was the life he led but heslept as soundly in his bed of seaweed on the wild precipice as he didin his bed at home.But one morning when he awoke a confused murmur broke upon his ear.Peering over the ledge he saw a crowd of soldiers standing on theshingle at the mouth of the cavern."Come down and surrender in the name of the emperor" cried thesergeant."Surrender" shouted all his men. And the vast dim place rang with theechoing sound of their voices."You can have my dead body if you care to come up here for it" criedRohan stepping into the light that fell from the hole in the cliff.The soldiers stared up in astonishment when Rohan appeared on the ledgeof the precipice. He was now a gaunt forlorn hunted man with a fewrags hanging about his body and a great shock of yellow hair tumblingbelow his shoulders. Under the stress of mental suffering his flesh hadwasted from his bones but his eyes flashed with a terrible light."Come down" said the sergeant raising his gun "or I will pick you offyour perch as if you were a crow."Instead of getting behind a rock Rohan stood up with a strange smile onhis face and said "If you want me you must come and fetch me."There was a flash a roar--the sergeant had fired. But when the smokehad cleared away Rohan was still standing on the ledge with the strangesmile on his face. The shot had gone wide."You can smile" said the sergeant angrily "but you cannot escape. If Icannot bring you down I will starve you out. My men are watching foryou above and below. You are surrounded.""And so are you" said Rohan with a laugh pointing to the mouth of thecavern. "Look behind you"The sergeant and his men turned round and gave a cry of dismay. Thetide had turned and the sea was surging fiercely into the mouth of the
comment267,cavern."Give him one volley" shouted the sergeant "and then swim for yourlives."But when the men turned to aim at Rohan he was no longer visible. Theyfired at random at the hole in the cliff and after filling the greatcavern with drifting smoke and echoing thunder they fled for theirlives wading swimming through the high spring tide."At any rate" said the sergeant when they had all got safely back toland "we can stop Mother Gwenfern from bringing the mad rebel any morefood."So a watch was set over the cottage in which Rohan's widowed motherlived and she was always searched whenever she left her house andbands of armed men kept guard night and day by the hole at the top ofthe cliff and by the seaward entrance to the cavern. At the end of twoweeks the sergeant resolved to make another attack. The man he thoughtmust surely have been starved to death as every avenue of aid had longsince been blocked.So one moonlight night at ebb tide the crowd of soldiers crept into thecavern and lashed two long ladders together and began to climb up theprecipice. But a strong arm seized the ladders from above and flungthem back on the granite floor of the cave. Standing like a ghost in thefaint silvery radiance falling through the hole in the cliff Rohanhurled down upon the dark mass of the besieging crowd great fragments ofrock which he had placed ready for use along the ledge on which heslept."Fire Fire" shrieked the sergeant pointing at the white figure ofRohan.But before the command could be obeyed Rohan got under shelter and thebullets rained harmlessly round the spot where he had just stood. Thenunder cover of fire some men advanced and again placed the ladderagainst the precipice. As Rohan crouched down on the ledge he wasstartled by the apparition of a human face. With a cry of rage hesprang to his feet and heedless of the bullets thudding on the rockaround him he slowly and painfully lifted up a terrible graniteboulder poised it for a moment over his head and then hurled it downat the shapes dimly struggling below him. There was a crash a shriek.Under the weight of the boulder the ladders broke and the men upon themfell down amid horrible cries of agony and terror.What happened after this Rohan never knew for overcome by frenzy andfatigue he swooned away. When he opened his eyes he was lying beneaththe hole in the cliff with the moonlight streaming upon his face. Frombelow him came the soft sound of lapping water and looking down hesaw that the tide had entered the cave and forced the besiegers to giveover their attack.Yes the battle was over and he had conquered His position indeed wasimpregnable had he been well supplied with food he could have held itagainst hundreds of men for a long period. But as he laid down on hisbed of seaweed a rough tongue licked his hand. It was his goatJannedik. For the last fortnight Rohan's mother had sent the goat everyday to her son with a basket of food tied round its neck and hidden inthe long hair of its throat. Rohan groped in the darkness for thebasket and Jannedik uttered a low cry of pain rolled over at his feetinto the moonlight revealing a terrible bullet-wound in its side andquivered and died. Some soldier had shot it.As Rohan stared at the dead body of his four-footed friend the strengthof mind which had enabled him to withstand all the power that Napoleonthe conqueror of Europe could bring against him at last went from him.Trembling and shivering he looked around him overcome by utterdesolation and despair. He had held out bravely but he could hold outno longer slowly and laboriously he climbed down the dark face of the
comment268,precipice and reached the narrow strip of shingle below just as themoon got clear from a cloud and lighted up the cavern. Its cold raysfell on the white face of the sergeant who laid half on the shingle andhalf in the water crushed by the great boulder with which Rohan hadbroken down the ladders.Rohan gazed for a moment on the features of the man he had killed andthen with a cry of agony and despair he fell upon his knees."Not on my head O God be the guilt" he prayed. "Not on my head buton his who hunted me down and made me what I am on his whose red swordshadows all the world and drives on millions of innocent men to murdereach other Ah God God God The men that Napoleon has slain Is itnot high time that some man like me sought him out and killed him andbrought peace back once more to this blood-covered earth of ours Yes Iwill do it"Rising wildly to his feet full of the strange strength and the strangepowers of madness Rohan Gwenfern climbed up the precipice to his bed ofseaweed and then took a path that no man had taken and lived--thesheer precipitous path from the roof of the cavern to the top of thecliff._III.--Rohan Meets Napoleon_As the Grand Army swept into Belgium for the last great battle againstthe united powers of England Germany Austria and Russia a strangesavage creature followed it--a gaunt half-naked man with long yellowhair falling almost to his waist and bloodshot eyes with a look ofmadness in them. How he lived it is difficult to tell. He never beggedbut the soldiers threw lumps of bread at him as he prowled round theircamp-fires asking everyone whom he met "Where is the emperor Where isNapoleon Do you think he will come this way"Twice he had been arrested as a spy and hastily condemned to be shot.But each time on hearing his sentence of death he gave so strange alaugh that the officer examined him more closely and then set him freesaying with scornful pity "It is a harmless maniac. Let him go."He always lagged in the rear of the advancing army and as each freshregiment arrived he mingled with the soldiers and asked them in afierce whisper "Is the emperor coming now Isn't he coming"At last one dark rainy evening the wild outcast saw the man for whomhe was seeking. Wrapped in an old grey overcoat and wearing a cockedhat from which the rain dripped heavily Napoleon stood on a hill withhis hands clasped behind his back his head sunk deep between hisshoulders looking towards Ligny. But he was guarded a crowd ofofficers stood close behind him waiting for orders.Suddenly a bareheaded soldier came riding along the road spurring andflogging his horse as if for dear life galloping wildly up the hill hehanded the emperor a dispatch. Napoleon glanced at it and spoke to hisstaff officers. With a wild movement of joy they drew their swords andwaved them in the air shouting "_Vive l'Empereur"_ Napoleon smiled.His star was again in the ascendant The Prussians were retreating fromLigny he had struck the first blow and it was a victoryNear the hill on which he was standing was a deserted farmhouse he gaveorders that it should be prepared for his reception. But as he rodedown the hill at the head of his staff the man who had been watchinghim divined his intention and reached the house before his attendants.
comment269,The soldiers who searched the place before Napoleon entered failed tosee the dark figure crouching up in the corner of a loft among the blackrafters."Leave me" said Napoleon to his men after he had finished the plainmeal of bread and wine set before him.To-morrow he would meet for the first time on the rolling fields ofWaterloo the only captain of a European army whom he had not defeated.He wanted to think his plans of battle over in silence. Some time hepaced up and down the room his chin drooping forward on his breast andhis hands clasped upon his back. Through the wide clear spaces of hismind great armies passed in black procession moving like storm-cloudsover the stricken earth burning cities rose in the distance amid theshrieks of dying men and the thunder of cannon. His plan was at lastmatured. Victory Yes that was certain So his thoughts ran. Anaide-de-camp entered with a dispatch. He tore it open and ran his eyeover it."It is nothing" he said. "Don't disturb me for two hours except on amatter of great importance. I want to sleep."Going up to the old armchair of oak that was set before the fire hefell on his knees and covered his eyes and prayed."What" said the man who was watching him up in the rafters. "Does Caindare to pray Surely God will not answer his prayers He is praying thathe may wipe the English to-morrow from the face of the earth and againcement his throne with blood and forge his sceptre of fire"That no doubt was what Napoleon prayed for. Yet when he rose up hisface was wonderfully changed and softened by the religious light whichhad shone on it for a few moments. Then throwing himself into thearmchair he closed his eyes. And as the fire burnt low Rohan Gwenfernsilently descended from the loft and something gleamed in his hand. Hecrept up to the sleeping emperor and stared at his face reading itline by line. Napoleon moved uneasily in his sleep and murmured tohimself and his hand opened and shut.As Rohan raised his knife to strike home to the heart of the tyrant hesaw the hand--white and small like a woman's or a child's. Again helooked at the face. Ah there was no imperial grandeur here Only afeeble sallow tired and sickly creature whom a strong man couldcrush down with one blow of his fist. Rohan grew weak as he looked andthe long knife almost fell from his clutch."I must kill him--I must kill him" he kept saying to himself. "His onelife against the peace and happiness of earth--the life of a Cain If heawakens war will awaken and fire famine and slaughter Kill himRohan kill him"Perhaps if Napoleon had not prayed before he slept his enemy would havecarried out his purpose. But he had prayed his face had becomebeautiful for a moment and he fell asleep as fearlessly as a child. NoRohan Gwenfern was not made of the stuff of which savage assassins areformed though there was madness in his brain there was still love inhis heart. He could not kill even Cain when God had sanctified themurderer with sleep. God had made Napoleon and God had sent him bloodyas he was he too was God's child.Opening the great casement window of the room in the farmhouse Gwenferngazed for a moment with wild eyes and quivering lips on the pale wornface of the great conqueror and then leaped out into the darkness. WhenNapoleon awoke a long knife was lying at his feet but he heeded it
comment270,not and little dreamt that a few minutes ago it had been pointed at hisheart.Ah Rohan Gwenfern had done well to leave the mighty emperor in thehands of God and go back a wild tattered mad beggar to hissweetheart Marcelle in the little Breton village of Kromlaix. For asNapoleon came out of the farmhouse and looked at the dawning sky thererose up clouding the lurid star of his destiny the blood-red shadow--WATERLOO                                   JOHN BUNYANThe Holy War      John Bunyan was born at Elstow near Bedford England in     1628. After receiving a scanty education at the village     school he worked hard at the forge with his father. In his     sixteenth year he lost his mother and soon after he joined     the army then engaged in the Civil War but his military     experience lasted only a few months. Returning to Elstow he     again worked at the forge and married. After various     alternating religious experiences in 1655 he became a member     of the Baptist congregation at Bedford of which he was ere     long chosen pastor. His success was extraordinary but after     five years his ministry was prohibited and he was     incarcerated in Bedford Gaol his imprisonment lasting for     twelve years. There he wrote his immortal "Pilgrim's     Progress." Released under the Act of Indulgence he resumed     his ministry and ultimately his pastoral charge in Bedford.     He took fever when on a visit to London and died on August     31 1688. The "Holy War" is considered by critics even     superior to the "Pilgrim" inasmuch as it betrays a finer     literary workmanship. It was written in 1682 after     molestation of Bunyan as a preacher had ceased and when he     was known widely as the author of the first part of the     "Pilgrim's Progress" the second part of which was published     two years later. Macaulay held that if there had been no     "Pilgrim's Progress" "Holy War" would have been the first of     religious allegories. No doubt its popularity has been due in     some degree to its kinship to that work but the vigour of its     style overcomes the minute elaboration of an almost impossible     theme and the book lives alike as literature and theology     by its own vitality. An elaborate analysis of it may be found     in Froude's volume on Bunyan. He said of it "'The Holy War'     would have entitled Bunyan to a place among the masters of     English Literature."_I.--The Founding of Mansoul_In the gallant country of Universe there is a fair and delicate town acorporation called Mansoul a town for its building so curious for its
comment271,situation so commodious for its privileges so advantageous that thereis not its equal under the whole heaven.As to the situation of the town it lieth between two worlds and thefirst founder and builder of it was one Shaddai who built it for hisown delight. And as he made it goodly to behold so also mighty to havedominion over all the country round about.There was reared up in the midst of this town a most famous and statelyplace--for strength it may be called a castle for pleasantness aparadise. This place King Shaddai intended for himself alone and notanother with him and of it he made a garrison but committed thekeeping of it only to the men of the town.This famous town of Mansoul had five gates--Eargate Eyegate MouthgateNosegate and Feelgate. It had always a sufficiency of provisions withinits walls and it had the best most wholesome and excellent law thatwas then extant in the world. There was not a rogue rascal ortraitorous person within its walls they were all true men and fastjoined together._II.--The Plot and Capture_Well upon a time there was one Diabolus a mighty giant made anassault upon the famous town of Mansoul to take it and make it his ownhabitation. This Diabolus was first one of the servants of King Shaddaiby whom he was raised to a most high and mighty place. But he seeinghimself thus exalted to greatness and honour and raging in his mind forhigher state and degree what doth he but begin to think with himselfhow he might set up as lord over all and have the sole power underShaddai--but that the king had reserved for his son. Wherefore Diabolusfirst consults with himself what had best to be done and then breakshis mind to some others of his companions to which they also agreed. Sothey came to the issue that they should make an attempt upon the king'sson to destroy him that the inheritance might be theirs.Now the king and his son being all and always eye could not butdiscern all passages in his dominions wherefore what does he but takesthem in the very nick and the first trip that they made towards theirdesign convicts them of the treason horrid rebellion and conspiracythat they had devised and casts them altogether out of all place oftrust benefit honours and preferment and this done he banishes themthe court turns them down into horrid pits never more to expect theleast favour at his hands.Banished from his court you may be sure they would now add to theirformer pride malice and rage against Shaddai. Wherefore roving andranging in much fury from place to place if perhaps they might findsomething that was the king's they happened into this spacious countryof Universe and steered their course to Mansoul. So when they found theplace they shouted horribly on it for joy saying "Now have we foundthe prize and how to be revenged on King Shaddai" So they sat down andcalled a council of war.Now with Diabolus was among others the fierce Alecto and Apollyonand the mighty giant Beelzebub and Lucifer and Legion. And Legion itwas whose advice was taken that they should assault the town in allpretended fairness covering their intentions with lies flatteries anddelusive words feigning things that will never be and promising thatto them which they shall never find. It was designed also that by astratagem they should destroy one Mr. Resistance otherwise calledCaptain Resistance--a man that the giant Diabolus and his band more
comment272,feared than they feared the whole town of Mansoul besides. And theyappointed one Tisiphone to do it.Thus having ended the council of war they rose up and marched towardsMansoul but all in a manner invisible save only Diabolus whoapproached the town in the shape and body of a dragon. So they drew upand sat down before Eargate and laid their ambuscade for Mr. Resistancewithin a bow shot of the town. Then Diabolus being come to the gatesounded his trumpet for audience at which the chiefs of the town suchas my lord Innocent my lord Will-be-will Mr. Recorder and CaptainResistance came down to the wall to see who was there and what was thematter.Diabolus then began his oration."Gentlemen of the famous town of Mansoul I have somewhat of concern toimpart unto you. And first I will assure you it is not my own but youradvantage that I seek. I am come to show you how you may obtain ampledeliverance from a bondage that unawares to yourselves you arecaptivated and enslaved under."At this the town of Mansoul began to prick up its ears."And what is it pray What is it" thought they.Then Diabolus spoke on."Touching your king I know he is great and potent but his laws areunreasonable intricate and intolerable. There is a great differenceand disproportion betwixt the life and an apple yet one must go for theother by the law of your Shaddai. Why should you be holden in ignoranceand blindness O ye inhabitants of Mansoul ye are not a free peopleAnd is it not grievous to think on that the very thing you areforbidden to do might you but do it would yield you both wisdom andhonour"And just now while Diabolus was speaking these words to MansoulTisiphone shot at Captain Resistance where he stood on the gate andmortally wounded him in the head so that he to the amazement of thetownsmen fell down quite dead over the wall. Now when CaptainResistance was dead--and he was the only man of war in the town--poorMansoul was left wholly naked of courage. Then stood forth Mr.Ill-pause that Diabolus brought with him as his orator and persuadedthe townsfolk to take of the tree which King Shaddai had forbidden andwhen they saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasantto the eye and a tree to be desired to make one wise they took and dideat. Now even while this Ill-pause was making his speech my lordInnocent--whether by a shot from the camp of the giant or from somequalm that suddenly took him or whether by the stinking breath of thattreacherous villain old Ill-pause for so I am most apt to think--sunkdown in the place where he stood still nor could he be brought to lifeagain.Now these brave men being dead what do the rest of the townsfolk butfall down and yield obedience to Diabolus and having eaten of theforbidden fruit they become drunk therewith and so opened both Eargateand Eyegate and let in Diabolus and all his band quite forgettingtheir good Shaddai and his law.Diabolus now bethinks himself of remodelling the town for his greatersecurity setting up one and putting down another at pleasure. Whereforehe put out of power and place my lord mayor whose name was my lord
comment273,Understanding and Mr. Recorder whose name was Mr. Conscience. But mylord Will-be-will a man of great strength resolution and courageresolved to bear office under Diabolus who perceiving the willingnessof my lord to serve him forthwith made him captain of the castlegovernor of the walls and keeper of the gates of Mansoul. He also hadMr. Mind for his clerk.When the giant had thus engarrisoned himself in the town of Mansoul hebetakes himself to defacing. Now there was in the market-place andalso in the gates of the castle an image of the blessed King Shaddai.This he commanded to be defaced and it was basely done by the hand ofMr. No-truth. Moreover Diabolus made havoc of the remains of the lawsand statutes of Shaddai and set up his own vain edicts such as gaveliberty to the lusts of the flesh the lusts of the eyes and the prideof life._III.--The Re-Taking of Mansoul_Now as you may well think long before this time word was carried tothe good King Shaddai that Mansoul was lost and it would have amazedone to have seen what sorrow and compunction of spirit there was amongall sorts at the king's court to think that the place was taken. But theking and his son foresaw all this before yea had sufficiently providedfor the relief of Mansoul though they told not everybody thereof.Wherefore after consultation the son of Shaddai--a sweet and comelyperson and one that always had great affection for those that were inaffliction--having striven hard with his father promised that he wouldbe his servant to recover Mansoul. The purport of this agreement wasthat at a certain time prefixed by both the king's son should take ajourney into the country of Universe and there in a way of justice andequity make amends for the follies of Mansoul and lay the foundationof her perfect deliverance.Now King Shaddai thought good at the first not to send his army by thehand and conduct of brave Emmanuel his son but under the hand of someof his servants to see first by them the temper of Mansoul and whetherthey would be won to the obedience of their king. So they came up toMansoul under the conduct of four stout generals each man being captainof ten thousand men and having his standard-bearer.Having travelled for many days at the king's cost not hurting orabusing any they came within sight of Mansoul the which when theysaw the captains could for their hearts do no less than bewail thecondition of the town for they quickly perceived it was prostrate tothe will of Diabolus.Well before the king's forces had set before Mansoul three daysCaptain Boanerges commanded his trumpeter to go down to Eargate tosummon Mansoul to give audience to the message he was commanded todeliver but there was none that appeared to give answer or regard.Again and again was the summons sounded till at last the townsmen cameup--having first made Eargate as sure as they could. So my lordIncredulity came up and showed himself over the wall. But when thecaptain had set eyes on him he cried out aloud "This is not he whereis my lord Understanding the ancient mayor of the town of Mansoul"Then stood forth the four captains and taking no notice of the giantDiabolus each addressed himself to the town of Mansoul but their brave
comment274,speeches the town refused to hear yet the sound thereof beat againstEargate though the force thereof could not break it open.Then Diabolus commanded the lord mayor Incredulity to give answer andhis oration was seconded by desperate Will-be-will while the recorderwhose name was Forget-good followed with threats. Then did the town ofMansoul shout for joy as if by Diabolus and his crew some greatadvantage had been obtained over the captains. They also rang the bellsand sang and made merry and danced for joy upon the walls. Now whenthe captains heard the answer of the great ones and they could not geta hearing from the old natives of the town they resolved to try it outby the power of the arm so with their slings they battered the housesand with rams they sought to break Eargate open but Mansoul stood itout so lustily that after several skirmishes and brisk encounters theymade a fair retreat and entrenched themselves in their winter quarters.But now could not Mansoul sleep securely as before nor could they go totheir debaucheries with quietness as in times past for they had fromthe camp of Shaddai such frequent warm alarms yea alarms upon alarmsfirst at one gate and then at another and again at all the gates atonce that they were broken as to former peace yea so distressed werethey that I daresay Diabolus their king had in these days his restmuch broken. And by degrees new thoughts possessed the minds of the menof the town. Some would say "There is no living thus." Others wouldthen reply "This will be over shortly." Then a third would answer "Letus turn to King Shaddai and so put an end to all these troubles." Theold gentlemen too Mr. Conscience the recorder that was so beforeDiabolus took Mansoul began to talk aloud and his words were now likegreat claps of thunder. Yea so far as I could gather the town had beensurrendered before now had it not been for the opposition of oldIncredulity and the fickleness of my lord Will-be-will.They of the king's army this winter sent three times to Mansoul tosubmit herself and these summonses especially the two last sodistressed the town that presently they called a consultation for aparley and offered to come to an agreement on certain terms but theywere such that the captains jointly and with the highest disdainrejected and returned to their trenches.The captains then gathered themselves together for a conference and
comment275,agreed that a petition should forthwith be drawn up and forwarded by afit man to Shaddai with speed that more forces be sent to Mansoul.Now the king at sight of the petition was glad but how much morethink you when it was seconded by his son. Wherefore the king calledto him Emmanuel his son and said "Come now therefore my son andprepare thyself for war for thou shalt go to my camp at Mansoul thoushalt also there prosper and prevail."The time for the setting forth being expired the king's son addresseshimself for the march and taketh with him five noble captains and theirforces. So they sat down before the town not now against the gatesonly but environed it round on every side. But first for two daystogether they hung out the white flag to give the townsfolk time toconsider but they as if they were unconcerned made no reply to thisfavourable signal so they then set the red flag upon the mount calledMount Justice.When Emmanuel had put all things in readiness to bid Diabolus battle hesent again to know of the town of Mansoul if in peaceable manner theywould yield themselves. They then together with Diabolus their kingcalled a council of war and resolved on certain propositions thatshould be offered to Emmanuel.Now there was in the town of Mansoul an old man a Diabolonian and hisname was Mr. Loath-to-Stoop a stiff man in his way and a great doerfor Diabolus him therefore they sent and put into his mouth what heshould say. But none of his proposals would Emmanuel grant--all hisensnaring propositions were rejected and Mr. Loath-to-Stoop departed.Then was an alarm sounded and the battering-rams were played and theslings whirled stones into the town amain and thus the battle began.And the word was at that time "Emmanuel." First Captain Boanerges madethree assaults most fierce one after another upon Eargate to theshaking of the posts thereof. Captain Conviction also made up fast withBoanerges and both discovering that the gate began to yield theycommanded that the rams should still be played against it. But CaptainConviction going up very near to the gate was with great force drivenback and received three wounds in the mouth. Nor did Captain Good-hopenor Captain Charity come behind in this most desperate fight for theytoo so behaved at Eyegate that they had almost broken it quite open. Andthis took away the hearts of many of the Diabolonians. As for Will-be-will I never saw him so daunted in my life and some say he got a woundin the leg.When the battle was over Diabolus again attempted to make terms byproposing a surrender on the condition that he should remain in the townas Emmanuel's deputy and press upon the people a reformation accordingto law but Emmanuel replied that nothing would be regarded that hecould propose for he had neither conscience to God nor love to the townof Mansoul. Diabolus therefore withdrew himself from the walls to thefort in the heart of the town and filled with despair of retaining thetown in his hands resolved to do it what mischief he could for saidhe "Better demolish the place and leave it a heap of ruins than that itshould be a habitation for Emmanuel."Knowing the next battle would issue in his being master of the placeEmmanuel gave out a royal commandment to all his men of war to showthemselves men of war against Diabolus and all Diabolonians but
comment276,favourable and meek to the old inhabitants of Mansoul. Then after threeor four notable charges Eargate was burst open and the bolts and barsbroken into a thousand pieces. Then did the prince's trumpets sound thecaptains shout the town shake and Diabolus retreat to his hold. Andthere was a great slaughter till the Diabolonians lay dead in everycorner--though too many were yet alive in Mansoul. Now the old recorderand my lord Understanding with some others of the chief of the towncame together and jointly agreed to draw up a petition and send it toEmmanuel while he sat in the gate of Mansoul. The contents of thepetition were these "That they--the old inhabitants of the deplorabletown of Mansoul--confessed their sin and were sorry that they hadoffended his princely majesty and prayed that he would spare theirlives." Unto this petition he gave no answer. After some time andtravail the gate of the castle was beaten open and so a way was made togo into the hold where Diabolus had hid himself.Now when he was come to the castle gates he commanded Diabolus tosurrender himself into his hands. But oh how loath was the beast toappear How he stuck at it How he shrunk How he cringed Then Emmanuelcommanded and they took Diabolus and bound him first in chains andled him to the market-place and stripped him of his armour. Thus havingmade Diabolus naked in the eyes of Mansoul the prince commands that heshall be bound with chains to his chariot-wheels and he rode in triumphover him quite through the town. And having finished this part of histriumph over Diabolus he turned him up in the midst of his contempt andshame. Then went he from Emmanuel and out of his camp to inheritparched places in a salt land seeking rest but finding none.Now the prince having by special orders put my lord Understanding Mr.Conscience and my lord Will-be-will in ward they again drew up apetition and sent it to Emmanuel by the hand of Mr. Would-Live and thisbeing unanswered they used as their messenger Mr. Desires-Awake andwith him went Mr. Wet-Eyes a near neighbour. Then the prisoners wereordered to go down to the camp and appear before the prince. This theydid with drooping spirits and ropes round their necks. But the princegave them their pardon embraced them took away their ropes and putchains of gold round their necks. He also sent by the recorder a pardonfor all the people of Mansoul.Then the prince commanded that the image of Diabolus should be takendown from the place where it was set up and that they should utterlydestroy it without the town wall and that the image of Shaddai hisfather should be set up again with his own. Moreover he renewed thecharter of the city and brought forth out of his treasury whiteglittering robes and granted to the people that they should put them onso that they were put into fine linen white and clean. Then said theprince unto them "This O Mansoul is my livery and the badge by whichmine are known from the servants of others. Wear them if you would beknown by the world to be mine."_IV.--The Downfall_But there was a man in the town named Mr. Carnal-Security and hebrought this corporation into great grievous bondage. When Emmanuelperceived that through the policy of Mr. Carnal-Security the hearts of
comment277,men were chilled and abated in their practical love for him he inprivate manner withdrew himself first from his palace then to the gateof the town and so away from Mansoul till they should more earnestlyseek his face.Then the Diabolonians who yet dwelt in Mansoul sent letters to Diaboluswho promised to come to their assistance for the ruin of the town withtwenty thousand Doubters. Diabolus suddenly making an assault onFeelgate the gate was forced and the prince's men were compelled tobetake themselves to the castle as the stronghold of the town leavingthe townsmen open to the ravages of the Doubters. Still the castle heldout and more urgent petitions to Emmanuel carried by Captain Credencebrought at last the assurance that he would come presently to the reliefof the town.Indeed before that time Diabolus had thought it wise to withdraw hismen from the town to the plain but here the Doubters being caughtbetween the defenders of the city and the rescuing army of Emmanuelwere slain to the last man and buried in the plains.Even yet Diabolus was not satisfied with his defeat but determined on alast attempt upon the town his army being made up of ten thousandDoubters and fifteen thousand Blood-men all rugged villains. But Mr.Prywell discovered their coming and they were put to route by theprince's captains the Blood-men being surrounded and captured.And so Mansoul arrived at some degree of peace and quiet and her princealso abode within her borders. Then the prince appointed a day when heshould meet the whole of the townsmen in the market-place and theybeing come together he said "Now my Mansoul I have returned to theein peace and thy transgressions against me are as if they had not been.Nor shall it be with thee as in former days but I will do better forthee than at the beginning."Yet a little while and I will take down this famous town of Mansoulstreet and stone to the ground and will set it up in such strength andglory in mine own country as it never did see in the kingdom where nowit is placed. There O my Mansoul thou shalt be afraid of murderers nomore of Diabolonians no more. There shall be no more plots nor
comment278,contrivances nor designs against thee. But first I charge thee thatthou dost hereafter keep more white and clean the liveries which I gavethee. When thy garments are white the world will count thee mine. Andnow that thou mayest keep them white I have provided for thee an openfountain to wash thy garments in. I have oft-times delivered thee andfor all this I ask thee nothing but that thou bear in mind my love.Nothing can hurt thee but sin nothing can grieve me but sin nothingmake thee pause before thy foes but sin. Watch Behold I lay none otherburden upon thee--hold fast till I come"                                   The Pilgrim's Progress      The "Pilgrim's Progress" was begun during Bunyan's second and     briefer term of imprisonment in Bedford gaol. As originally     conceived the work was something entirely different from the     masterpiece that was finally produced. Engaged upon a     religious treatise Bunyan had occasion to compare Christian     progress to a pilgrimage--a simile by no means uncommon even     in those days. Soon he discovered a number of points which had     escaped his predecessors and countless images began to crowd     quickly upon his imaginative brain. Released at last from     gaol he still continued his work acquainting no one with his     labours and receiving the help of none. The "Pilgrim" on its     appearance in 1678 was but a moderate success but it was not     long before its charm made itself felt and John Bunyan     counted his readers by the thousand in Scotland in the     Colonies in Holland and among the Huguenots of France.     Within ten years 100000 copies were sold. With the exception     of the Bible it is perhaps the most widely-read book in the     English language and has been translated into seventy foreign     tongues._I.--The Battle with Apollyon_As I walked through the wilderness of this world I lighted on a certainplace where there was a den and laid me down in that place to sleepand as I slept I dreamed a dream. I dreamed I saw a man clothed withrags standing with his face from his own house a book in his hand anda great burden upon his back.
comment279,"O my dear wife and children" he said "I am informed that our citywill be burnt with fire from heaven. We shall all come to ruin unless wecan find a way of escape"His relations and friends thought that some distemper had got into hishead but he kept crying in spite of all that they said to quieten him"What shall I do to be saved" He looked this way and that way butcould not tell which road to take. And a man named Evangelist came tohim and he said to Evangelist "Whither must I fly""Do you see yonder wicket gate" said Evangelist pointing with hisfinger over a very wide field. "Go there and knock and you will betold what to do."I saw in my dream that the man began to run and his wife and childrencried after him to return but the man ran on crying "Life lifeeternal life"Two of his neighbours pursued him and overtook him. Their names wereObstinate and Pliable."Come come friend Christian" said Obstinate. "Why are you hurryingaway in this manner from the City of Destruction in which you wereborn""Because I have read in my book" replied Christian "that it will beconsumed with fire from heaven. I pray you good neighbours come withme and seek for some way of escape."After listening to all that Christian said Pliable resolved to go withhim but Obstinate returned to the City of Destruction in scorn."What Leave my friends and comforts for such a brain-sick fellow asyou No I will go back to my own home."Christian and Pliable walked on together without looking whither theywere going and in the midst of the plain they fell into a very miryslough which was called the Slough of Despond. Here they wallowed for atime and Christian because of the burden that was on his back beganto sink in the mire."Is this the happiness you told me of" said Pliable. "If I get outagain with my life you shall make your journey alone."With a desperate effort he got out of the mire and went back leavingChristian alone in the Slough of Despond. As Christian struggled underhis burden towards the wicket gate I saw in my dream that a man came tohim whose name was Help and drew him out and set him upon soundground. But before Christian could get to the wicket gate Mr. WorldlyWiseman came and spoke to him."How now good fellow" said Mr. Worldly Wiseman. "Where are you goingwith that heavy burden on your back""To yonder wicket gate" said Christian. "For there Evangelist told meI shall be put into a way to be rid of my heavy burden.""Evangelist is a dangerous and troublesome fellow" said Mr. WorldlyWiseman. "Do not follow his counsel. Hear me I am older than you. I cantell you an easy way to get rid of your burden. You see the village onyonder high hill""Yes" said Christian. "I remember the village is called Morality.""It is" said Mr. Worldly Wiseman. "There you will find a very judiciousgentleman whose name is Mr. Legality. If he is not in inquire for hisson Mr. Civility. Both of them have great skill in helping men to getburdens off their shoulders."Christian resolved to follow Mr. Worldly Wiseman's advice. But as hewas painfully climbing up the high hill Evangelist came up to him andsaid "Are you not the man that I found crying in the City ofDestruction and directed to the little wicket gate How is it that youhave gone so far out of the way"Christian blushed for shame and said that he had been led astray by Mr.Worldly Wiseman."Mr. Worldly Wiseman" said Evangelist "is a wicked man. Mr. Legalityis a cheat and his son Mr. Civility is a hypocrite. If you listen tothem they will beguile you of your salvation and turn you from theright way."Evangelist then set Christian in the true path which led to the wicketgate over which was written "Knock and it shall be opened unto you."And Christian knocked and a grave person named Goodwill opened thegate and let him in. I saw in my dream that Christian asked him to help
comment280,him off with the burden that was upon his back and Goodwill pointed toa narrow way running from the wicket gate and said "Do you see thatnarrow way That is the way you must go. Keep to it and do not turndown any of the wide and crooked roads and you will soon come to theplace of deliverance where your burden will fall from your back ofitself."Christian then took his leave of Goodwill and climbed up the narrow waytill he came to a place upon which stood a cross. And I saw in my dreamthat as Christian came to the cross his burden fell from off his backand he became glad and lightsome. He gave three leaps for joy and wenton his way singing and at nightfall he came to a very stately palacethe name of which was Beautiful. Four grave and lovely damsels namedCharity Discretion Prudence and Piety met him at the thresholdsaying "Come in thou blessed of the Lord This palace was built onpurpose to entertain such pilgrims as thou."Christian sat talking with the lovely damsels until supper was readyand then they led him to a table that was furnished with fat things andexcellently fine wines. And after Christian had refreshed himself thedamsels showed him into a large chamber whose window opened towards thesun-rising. The name of the chamber was Peace and there Christian slepttill break of day. Then he awoke singing for joy and the damsels tookhim into the armoury and dressed him for battle. They harnessed him inarmour of proof and gave him a stout shield and a good sword for theysaid he would have to fight many a battle before he got to theCelestial City.And I saw in my dream that Christian went down the hill on which theHouse Beautiful stood and came to a valley that was called the Valleyof Humiliation where he was met by a foul fiend Apollyon."Prepare to die" said Apollyon straddling over the whole breadth ofthe narrow way. "I swear by my infernal den that thou shalt go nofurther. Here will I spill thy soul."With that he threw a flaming dart at his breast but Christian caughtit on his shield. Then Apollyon rushed upon him throwing darts as thickas hail and notwithstanding all that Christian could do Apollyonwounded him and made him draw back. The sore combat lasted for half aday and though Christian resisted as manfully as he could he grewweaker and weaker by reason of his wounds. At last Apollyon espyinghis opportunity closed in on Christian and wrestling with him gavehim a dreadful fall and Christian's sword flew out of his hand."Ah" cried Apollyon "I am sure of thee now"He pressed him almost to death and Christian began to despair of life.But as God would have it while Apollyon was fetching his last blow tomake an end of this good man Christian nimbly reached out his hand forhis sword and caught it and gave him a deadly thrust. With thatApollyon spread forth his wings and sped him away and Christian sawhim no more.Then with some leaves from the tree of life Christian healed hiswounds and with his sword drawn in his hand he marched through theValley of Humiliation without meeting any more enemies.But at the end of the valley was another called the Valley of theShadow of Death. On the right hand of this valley was a very deep ditchit was the ditch into which the blind have led the blind in all agesand have there miserably perished. And on the left hand was a dangerousquagmire into which if even a good man falls he finds no bottom forhis foot to stand on. The pathway here was exceeding narrow and verydark and Christian was hard put to it to get through safely. And rightby the wayside in the midst of the valley was the mouth of hell andout of it came flame and smoke in great abundance with sparks andhideous noises. But when the hosts of hell came at him as he travelledon through the smoke and flame and dreadful noise he cried out "I willwalk in the strength of the Lord God"Thereupon the fiends gave over and came no further and suddenly theday broke and Christian turned and saw all the hobgoblins satyrs anddragons of the pit far behind him and though he was now got into themost dangerous part of the Valley of the Shadow of Death he was no
comment281,longer afraid. The place was so set here with snares traps gins andnets and there with pits and holes and shelvings that had it beendark he would surely have perished. But it was now clear day and bywalking warily Christian got safely to the end of the valley. And at theend of the valley he saw another pilgrim marching on at some distancebefore him."Ho ho" shouted Christian. "Stay and I will be your companion.""No I cannot stay" said the other pilgrim whose name was Faithful. "Iam upon my life and the avenger of blood is behind me."Putting out all his strength Christian quickly got up with Faithful.Then I saw in my dream they went very lovingly on together and hadsweet discourse of all things that had happened to them in theirpilgrimage for they had been neighbours in the City of Destruction andboth of them were bound for the Delectable Mountains and the CelestialCity beyond. They were now in a great wilderness and they walked ontogether till they came to the town of Vanity at which a fair is keptall the year long called Vanity Fair._II.--Vanity Fair_I saw in my dream that Christian and Faithful tried to avoid seeingVanity Fair but this they could not do because the way to theCelestial City lies through the town where this lusty fair is kept.About 5000 years ago Beelzebub Apollyon and the rest of the fiendssaw by the path which the pilgrims made that their way lay through thetown of Vanity. So they set up a fair there in which all sorts ofvanity should be sold every day in the year. Among the merchandise soldat this fair are lands honours titles lusts pleasures andpreferments delights of all kinds as servants gold silver andprecious stones murders and thefts blood and bodies yea and livesand souls. Moreover at this fair there are at all times to be seenjugglings cheats games plays fools apes knaves and rogues andthat of every sort.When Christian and Faithful came through Vanity Fair everybody began tostare and mock at them for they were clothed in a raiment differentfrom the raiment of the multitude that traded in the fair and theirspeech also was different and few could understand what they said. Butwhat amused the townspeople most of all was that the pilgrims set lightby all their wares."What will ye buy What will ye buy" said one merchant to themmockingly."We buy the truth" said Christian and Faithful looking gravely uponhim.At this some men began to taunt the pilgrims and some tried to strikethem and things at last came to a hubbub and great stir and all thefair was thrown into disorder. Thereupon Christian and Faithful werearrested as disturbers of the peace. After being beaten and rolled inthe dirt they were put into a cage and made a spectacle to all the menof the fair. The next day they were again beaten and led up and downthe fair in heavy chains for an example and terror to others.But some of the better sort were moved to take their part and this soangered the chief men in the town that they resolved to put the pilgrimsto death. They were therefore indicted before the Lord Chief JusticeHategood with having disturbed the trade of Vanity Fair and won a party
comment282,over to their own pernicious way of thinking in contempt of the law ofPrince Beelzebub. Mr. Envy Mr. Superstition and Mr. Pickthank borewitness against them and the jurymen on hearing Faithful affirm thatthe customs of their town of Vanity were opposed to the spirit ofChristianity brought him in guilty of high treason to Beelzebub. Nodoubt they would have condemned Christian also but by the mercy ofGod he escaped from prison being assisted by one of the men of thetown named Hopeful who had come over to his way of thinking.Faithful was tied to a stake and scourged and stoned and burnt todeath. But I saw in my dream that the Shining Ones came with a chariotand horses and made their way through the multitude to the flames inwhich Faithful was burning and put him in the chariot and with thesound of trumpets carried him up through the clouds and on to the gateof the Celestial City.So Christian was left alone to continue his journey but I saw in mydream that as he was going out of the town of Vanity Hopeful came upto him and said that he would be his companion. And thus it ever is.Whenever a man dies to bear testimony to the truth another rises out ofhis ashes to carry on his work.Christian was in no wise cast down by the death of Faithful but went onhis way singing    Hail Faithful hail Thy goodly works survive    And though they killed thee thou art still alive.And he was especially comforted by Hopeful telling him that there were agreat many men of the better sort in Vanity Fair who were now resolvedto undertake the pilgrimage to the Celestial City. Some way beyondVanity Fair was a delicate plain called Ease where Christian andHopeful went with much content. But at the farther side of that plainwas a little hill which was named Lucre. In this hill was a silver-minewhich was very dangerous to enter for many men who had gone to digsilver there had been smothered in the bottom by damps and noisome airs.Four men from Vanity Fair--Mr. Money-love Mr. Hold-the-World Mr.By-Ends and Mr. Save-All--were going into the silver-mine as Christianand Hopeful passed by."Tarry for us" said Mr. Money-love "and when we have got a littleriches to take us on our journey we will come with you."Hopeful was willing to wait for his fellow-townsmen but Christian toldhim that having entered the mine they would never come out andbesides that treasure is a snare to them that seek it for it hindereththeir pilgrimage. And he spoke truly for I saw in my dream that somewere killed by falling into the mine as they gazed from the brink andthe rest who went down to dig were poisoned by the vapours in the pit.In the meantime Christian and Hopeful came to the river of life andwalked along the bank with great delight. They drank of the water of theriver which was pleasant and enlivening to their weary spirits and
comment283,they ate of the fruit of the green trees that grew by the river side.Then finding a fair meadow covered with lilies they laid down andslept and in the morning they rose up wondrously refreshed andcontinued their journey along the bank of the river. But the way soongrew rough and stony and seeing on their left hand a stile across themeadow called By-Path Meadow Christian leaped over it and said toHopeful "Come good Hopeful let us go this way. It is much easier.""I am afraid" said Hopeful "that it will take us out of the rightroad."But Christian persuaded him to jump over the stile and there they gotinto a path which was very easy for their feet. But they had not gonevery far when it began to rain and thunder and lighten in a mostdreadful manner and night came on apace and stumbling along in thedarkness they reached Doubting Castle and the lord thereof GiantDespair took them and threw them into a dark and dismal dungeon. Herethey lay for three days without one bit of bread or drop of drink. Onthe third day Giant Despair came and flogged them with a great crabtreecudgel and so disabled them that they were not even able to rise upfrom the mire of their dungeon floor. And indeed they could scarcelykeep their heads above the mud in which they lay.Now Giant Despair had a wife and her name was Diffidence and when shefound that in spite of their flogging Christian and Hopeful were stillalive she advised her husband to kill them outright. It happenedhowever to be sunshiny weather and sunshiny weather always made GiantDespair fall into a helpless fit in which he lost for the time the useof his hands. So all he could do was to try and persuade his prisonersto kill themselves with knife or halter."Why" said he to Christian and Hopeful "should you choose to live Youknow you can never get out of Doubting Castle. What Will you slowlystarve to death like rats in a hole instead of putting a sudden end toyour misery like men. I tell you again you will never get out."But when he was gone Christian and Hopeful went down on their knees intheir dungeon and prayed long and earnestly. Then Christian suddenlybethought himself and after fumbling in his bosom he drew out a keysaying "What a fool am I to lie in a dismal dungeon when I can walk atliberty Here is the key that I have been carrying in my bosom calledPromise that will open every lock in Doubting Castle."He at once tried it at the dungeon door and turned the bolt with ease.He then led Hopeful to the iron gate of the castle and though the lockwent desperately hard yet the key opened it. But as the gate moved itmade such a creaking that Giant Despair was aroused.Hastily rising up the giant set out to pursue the prisoners but seeingthat all the land was now flooded with sunshine he fell into one of hishelpless fits and could not even get as far as the castle gate._III.--The Celestial City_Having thus got safely out of Doubting Castle Christian and Hopeful
comment284,made their way back to the banks of the river of life and followingthe rough and stony way they came at last to the Delectable Mountains.And going up the mountains they beheld the gardens and orchards thevineyards the fountains of water and here they drank and washedthemselves and freely ate of the pleasant grapes of the vineyards. Nowon top of the mountains there were four shepherds feeding their flocksand the pilgrims went to them and leaning upon their staffs theyasked them the way to the Celestial City. And the shepherds took them bythe hand and led them to the top of Clear the highest of all theDelectable Mountains and the pilgrims looked and saw faintly and veryfar off the gate and the glory of the Celestial City.And I saw in my dream that the two pilgrims went down the DelectableMountains along the narrow way and after walking some distance theycame to a place where the path branched. Here they stood still for awhile considering which way to take for both ways seemed right. And asthey were considering behold a man black of flesh and covered with awhite robe came up to them and offered to lead them down the true way.But when they had followed him for some time they found that he had ledthem into a crooked road and there they were entangled in a net.Here they lay bewailing themselves and at last they espied a ShiningOne coming toward them with a whip in his hand."We are poor pilgrims going to the Celestial City" said Christian andHopeful. "A black man clothed in white offered to lead us there butentangled us instead in this net.""It was Flatterer that did this" said the Shining One. "He is a falseapostle that hath transformed himself into an angel."I saw in my dream that he then rent the net and let the pilgrims out.Then he commanded them to lie down and when they did so he chastisedthem with his whip of cords to teach them to walk in the good way andrefrain from following the advice of evil flatterers. And they thankedhim for his kindness and went softly along the right path singing forvery joy and after passing through the Enchanted Land which was fullof vapours that made them dull and sleepy they came to the sweet andpleasant country of Beulah. In this country the sun shone night and dayand the air was so bright and clear that they could see the CelestialCity to which they were going. Yea they met there some of theinhabitants for the Shining Ones often walked in the Land of Beulahbecause it was on the borders of Heaven.As Christian and Hopeful drew near to the city their strength began tofail. It was builded of pearls and precious stones and the streets were
comment285,paved with gold and what with the natural glory of the city and thedazzling radiance of the sunbeams that fell upon it Christian grew sickwith desire as he beheld it and Hopeful too was stricken with thesame malady. And walking on very slowly full of the pain of longingthey came at last to the gate of the city. But between them and the gatethere was a river and the river was very deep and no bridge went overit. And when Christian asked the Shining Ones how he could get to thegate of the city they said to him "You must go through the river oryou cannot come to the gate.""Is the river very deep" said Christian."You will find it deeper or shallower" said the Shining Ones"according to the depth or shallowness of your belief in the King of ourcity."The two pilgrims then entered the river. Christian at once began tosink and crying out to his good friend Hopeful he said "I sink indeep waters The billows go over my head All the waves go over me.""Be of good cheer my brother" said Hopeful "I feel the bottom and itis good"With that a great darkness and horror fell upon Christian he could nolonger see before him and he was in much fear that he would perish inthe river and never enter in at the gate. When he recovered he foundhe had got to the other side and Hopeful was already there waiting forhim.And I saw in my dream that the city stood upon a mighty hill but thepilgrims went up with ease because they had left their mortal garmentsbehind them in the river.While they were thus drawing to the gate behold a company of theheavenly host came out to meet them. With them were several of theKing's trumpeters clothed in white and shining raiment who made eventhe heavens to echo with their shouting and the sound of their trumpets.Then all the bells in the city began to ring welcome and the gate wasopened wide and the two pilgrims entered. And lo as they entered theywere transfigured and they had raiment put on that shone like gold. AndShining Ones gave them harps to praise their King with and crowns intoken of honour.And as the gates were opened I looked in and behold the streets werepaved with gold and in them walked many men with crowns on theirheads palms in their hands and golden harps to sing praises withal.There were also of them that had wings and they answered one anothersaying "Holy holy holy is the Lord" And after that they shut up thegates which when I had seen I wished myself among them. Then I awokeand behold it was a dream.                                   FANNY BURNEYEvelina      "Evelina" was the first tale written by a woman and     purporting to be a picture of life and manners that lived or     deserved to live. It took away reproach from the novel. The     opinion is Macaulay's. In many respects the publication of     "Evelina" resembled that of "Jane Eyre" by Charlotte Bront     a century later. It was issued anonymously by a firm that did
comment286,     not know the name of the writer. Only the children of the     household from which the book came knew its origin. It     attained an immediate and immense success which gave the     author a shrinking and modest little body a foremost place     in the literary world of her day. Fanny Burney the second     daughter of Dr. Burney was born in 1752 and published     "Evelina or a Young Lady's Entrance into the World" in 1778.     She had picked up an education at home without any tuition     whatever but had the advantage of browsing in her father's     large miscellaneous library and observing his brilliant     circle of friends. She knew something of the Johnson set     before she wrote "Evelina" and became the doctor's pet.     Later Fanny Burney wrote "Cecilia" for which she received     two thousand guineas and "Camilla" for which she received     three thousand guineas._I.--Deserted_LADY HOWARD TO THE REV. MR. VILLARSCan anything be more painful to the friendly mind than a necessity ofcommunicating disagreeable intelligence I have just had a letter fromMadame Duval who has lately used her utmost endeavours to obtain afaithful account of whatever related to her ill-advised daughter andhaving some reason to apprehend that upon her death-bed her daughterbequeathed an infant orphan to the world she says that if you withwhom she understands the child is placed will procure authentic proofsof its relationship to her you may send it to Paris where she willproperly provide for it.Her letter has excited in my daughter Mrs. Mirvan a strong desire tobe informed of the motives which induced Madame Duval to abandon theunfortunate Lady Belmont at a time when a mother's protection waspeculiarly necessary for her peace and reputation and I cannot satisfyMrs. Mirvan otherwise than by applying to you.MR. VILLARS TO LADY HOWARDYour ladyship did but too well foresee the perplexity and uneasiness ofwhich Madame Duval's letter has been productive. In regard to my answerI most humbly request your ladyship to write to this effect "That Iwould not upon any account intentionally offend Madame Duval but that Ihave unanswerable reasons for detaining her granddaughter at present inEngland."Complying with the request of Mrs. Mirvan I would say that I had thehonour to accompany Mr. Evelyn the grandfather of my young charge whenupon his travels in the capacity of a tutor. His unhappy marriageimmediately upon his return to England with Madame Duval then awaiting-girl at a tavern contrary to the entreaties of his friendsinduced him to fix his abode in France. He survived the ill-judgedmarriage but two years.Mr. Evelyn left me the sole guardianship of his daughter's person tillher eighteenth year but in regard to fortune he left her whollydependent on her mother. Miss Evelyn was brought up under my care andexcept when at school under my roof. In her eighteenth year hermother then married to Monsieur Duval sent for her to Paris and atthe instigation of her husband tyrannically endeavoured to effect aunion between Miss Evelyn and one of his nephews. Miss Evelyn soon grewweary of such usage and rashly and without a witness consented to aprivate marriage with Sir John Belmont a very profligate young man whohad but too successfully found means to insinuate himself into herfavour. He promised to conduct her to England--he did. O madam you knowthe rest Disappointed of the fortune he expected by the inexcusablerancour of the Duvals he infamously burnt the certificate of theirmarriage and denied that they had ever been unitedShe flew to my protection and the moment that gave birth to her infantput an end at once to the sorrows and the life of its mother. Thatchild madam shall never know the loss she has sustained. Not only my
comment287,affection but my humanity recoils at the barbarous idea of desertingthe sacred trust reposed in me._II.--A Visit to Town_LADY HOWARD TO MR. VILLARSYour last letter gave me infinite pleasure. Do you think you could bearto part with your young companion for two or three months Mrs. Mirvanproposes to spend the ensuing spring in London whither for the firsttime my grandchild will accompany her and it is their earnest wish thatyour amiable ward may share equally with her own daughter the care andattention of Mrs. Mirvan. What do you say to our schemeMR. VILLARS TO LADY HOWARDI am grieved madam to appear obstinate and I blush to incur theimputation of selfishness. My young ward is of an age that happiness iseager to attend--let her then enjoy it I commit her to the protectionof your ladyship. Restore her but to me all innocence as you receiveher and the fondest hope of my heart will be amply gratified.EVELINA ANVILLE TO MR. VILLARSWe are to go on Monday to a private ball given by Mrs. Stanley a veryfashionable lady of Mrs. Mirvan's acquaintance. I am afraid of thisball for as you know I have never danced but at school. However MissMirvan says there is nothing in it. Yet I wish it was over.                                   We passed a most extraordinary evening. A _private_ ball this wascalled but my dear sir I believe I saw half the worldThe gentlemen as they passed and repassed looked as if they thought wewere quite at their disposal and only waited for the honour of theircommands and they sauntered about in an indolent manner as if with aview to keep us in suspense.Presently a gentleman who seemed about six-and-twenty years old gailybut not foppishly dressed and indeed extremely handsome with an air ofmixed politeness and gallantry desired to know if I would honour himwith my hand. Well I bowed and I am sure I coloured for indeed I wasfrightened at the thought of dancing before so many strangers _with_ astranger. And so he led me to join in the dance.He seemed desirous of entering into conversation with me but I wasseized with such panic that I could hardly speak a word. He appearedsurprised at my terror and I fear thought it very strange.His own conversation was sensible and spirited his air and address openand noble his manners gentle attentive and infinitely engaging hisperson is all elegance and his countenance the most animated andexpressive I have ever seen. The rank of Lord Orville was his leastrecommendation. When he discovered I was totally ignorant of publicplaces and public performers he ingeniously turned the discourse to theamusements and occupations of the country but I was unable to gofurther than a monosyllable in reply and not even so far as that when Icould possibly avoid it.Tired ashamed and mortified I begged at last to sit down till wereturned home. Lord Orville did me the honour to hand me to the coach
comment288,talking all the way of the honour I had done _him_ Oh thesefashionable people                                   There is no end to the troubles of last night. I have gathered fromMaria Mirvan the most curious dialogue that ever I heard. Maria wastaking some refreshment and saw Lord Orville advancing for the samepurpose himself when a gay-looking man Sir Clement Willoughby I amtold stepped up and cried "Why my lord what have you done with yourlovely partner""Nothing" answered Lord Orville with a smile and a shrug."By Jove" said the man "she is the most beautiful creature I ever sawin my life"Lord Orville laughed but answered "Yes a pretty modest-lookinggirl""Oh my lord" cried the other "she is an angel""A silent one" returned he."Why my lord she looks all intelligence and expression""A poor weak girl" answered Lord Orville shaking his head. "Whetherignorant or mischievous I will not pretend to determine but sheattended to all I said to her with the most immovable gravity."Here Maria was called to dance and so heard no more.Now tell me sir did you ever know anything more provoking "A poorweak girl Ignorant and mischievous" What mortifying words I would notlive here for the world. I care not how soon I leave._III.--An Unlucky Meeting_EVELINA TO MR. VILLARSHow much will you be surprised my dearest sir at receiving so soonanother letter from London in your Evelina's writing. An accidentequally unexpected and disagreeable has postponed our journey to LadyHoward at Howard Grove.We went last night to see the "Fantocini" a little comedy in French andItalian by puppets and when it was over and we waited for our coacha tall elderly foreign-looking woman brushed quickly past us callingout "My God What shall I do I have lost my company and in this placeI don't know anybody.""We shall but follow the golden rule" said Mrs. Mirvan "if we carryher to her lodgings."We therefore admitted her to her coach to carry her to Oxford Road. Letme draw a veil over a scene too cruel for a heart so compassionate asyours and suffice it to know that in the course of our ride thisforeigner proved to be Madame Duval--the grandmother of your Evelina
comment289,When we stopped at her lodgings she desired me to accompany her into thehouse and said she could easily procure a room for me to sleep in.I promised to wait upon her at what time she pleased the next day.What an unfortunate adventure I could not close my eyes the wholenight.Mrs. Mirvan was so kind as to accompany me to Madame Duval's house thismorning. She frowned most terribly on Mrs. Mirvan but received me withas much tenderness as I believe she was capable of feeling. She avowedthat her intention in visiting England was to make me return with her toFrance. As it would have been indecent for me to have quitted town thevery instant I discovered that Madame Duval was in it we havedetermined to remain in London for some days. But I my dear and mosthonoured sir shall have no happiness till I am again with you.MR. VILLARS TO EVELINASecure of my protection let no apprehensions of Madame Duval disturbyour peace. Conduct yourself towards her with all respect and deferencedue to so near a relation remembering always that the failure of dutyon her part can by no means justify any neglect on yours. Make known toher the independence I assure you of and when she fixes the time forher leaving England trust to me the task of refusing your attendingher.EVELINA TO MR. VILLARSI have spent the day in a manner the most uncomfortable imaginable.Madame Duval on my visiting her insisted upon my staying with her allday as she intended to introduce me to some of my own relations. Theseconsisted of a Mr. Brangton who is her nephew and three of hischildren--a son and two daughters--and I am not ambitious of being knownto more of my relations if they have any resemblance to those whoseacquaintance I have already made.I had finished my letter to you when a violent rapping at the door mademe run downstairs and who should I see in the drawing-room but LordOrvilleHe inquired of our health with a degree of concern that rather surprisedme and when I told him our time for London is almost expired he asked"And does Miss Anville feel no concern at the idea of the many mournersher absence will occasion""Oh my lord I'm sure you don't think"--I stopped there for I hardlyknew what I was going to say. My foolish embarrassment I suppose wasthe cause of what followed for he came and took my hand saying "I dothink that whoever has once seen Miss Anville must receive an impressionnever to be forgotten."This compliment--from Lord Orville--so surprised me that I could notspeak but stood silent and looking down till recollecting my situationI withdrew my hand and told him I would see if Mrs. Mirvan was in.I have since been extremely angry with myself for neglecting soexcellent an opportunity of apologising for my behaviour at the ball.Was it not very odd that he should make me such a compliment                                   Mrs. Mirvan secured places last night for the play at Drury Lane Theatre
comment290,in the front row of a side box. Sir Clement Willoughby whoseconversation with Lord Orville respecting me on the night of the ballMiss Mirvan overheard was at the door of the theatre and handed usfrom the carriage. We had not been seated five minutes before LordOrville whom we saw in the stage-box came to us and he honoured uswith his company all the evening. To-night we go to the opera where Iexpect very great pleasure. We shall have the same party as at the playfor Lord Orville said he should be there and would look for us._IV.--A Compromising Situation_EVELINA TO MR. VILLARSI could write a volume of the adventures of yesterday.While Miss Mirvan and I were dressing for the opera what was oursurprise to see our chamber-door flung open and the two Miss Brangtonsenter the room They advanced to me with great familiarity saying "Howdo you do cousin So we've caught you at the glass Well we'redetermined to tell our brother of that" Miss Mirvan who had neverbefore seen them could not at first imagine who they were till theelder said "We've come to take you to the opera miss. Papa and mybrother are below and we are to call for your grandmother as we goalong."I told them I was pre-engaged and endeavoured to apologise. But theyhastened away saying "Well her grandmamma will be in a fine passionthat's one good thing"And indeed shortly afterwards Madame Duval arrived her face thecolour of scarlet and her eyes sparkling with fury and behaved soviolently that to appease her I consented by Mrs. Mirvan's advice togo with madame's party.At the opera I was able from the upper gallery to distinguish thehappy party I had left with Lord Orville seated next to Mrs. Mirvan.During the last scene I perceived standing near the gallery door SirClement Willoughby. I was extremely vexed and would have given theworld to have avoided being seen by him in company with a family so lowbred and vulgar.As soon as he was within two seats of us he spoke to me. "I am veryhappy Miss Anville to have found you for the ladies below have each ahumble attendant and therefore I am come to offer my services here.""Why then" cried I "I will join them." So I turned to Madame Duvaland said "As our party is so large madame if you give me leave I willgo down to Mrs. Mirvan that I may not crowd you in the coach."And then without waiting for an answer I suffered Sir Clement to handme out of the gallery.We could not however find Mrs. Mirvan in the confusion and SirClement said "You can have no objection to permitting me to see yousafe home"While he was speaking I saw Lord Orville who advanced instantlytowards me and with an air and voice of surprise said "Do I see MissAnville"I was inexpressibly distressed to suffer Lord Orville to think mesatisfied with the single protection of Sir Clement Willoughby andcould not help exclaiming "Good heaven what can I do""Why my dear madam" cried Sir Clement "should you be thus uneasy Youwill reach Queen Ann Street almost as soon as Mrs. Mirvan and I am sureyou cannot doubt being as safe."Just then the servant came and told him the carriage was ready and hehanded me into it while Lord Orville with a bow and a half-smilewished me good-night.When I reached home Miss Mirvan ran out to meet me and who should I seebehind her but--Lord Orville who with great politeness congratulatedme that the troubles of the evening had so happily ended and said hehad found it impossible to return home before he inquired after my
comment291,safety.I am under cruel apprehensions lest Lord Orville should suppose my beingon the stairs with Sir Clement was a concerted scheme._V.--A Growing Acquaintance_EVELINA TO MISS MIRVANBerry Hill Dorset.--When we arrived here how did my heart throb withjoy And when through the window I beheld the dearest the mostvenerable of men with uplifted hands returning as I doubt not thanksfor my safe arrival I thought it would have burst my bosom When I flewinto the parlour he could scarce articulate the blessings with which hiskind and benevolent heart overflowed.Everybody I see takes notice of my looking pale and ill and all my goodfriends tease me about my gravity and indeed dejection. Mrs. Selwyna lady of large fortune who lives near is going in a short time toBristol and has proposed to take me with her for the recovery of myhealth.EVELINA TO MR. VILLARSBristol Hotwells.--Lord Orville is coming to Bristol with his sisterLady Louisa Larpent. They are to be at the Honourable Mrs. Beaumont'sand it will be impossible to avoid seeing him as Mrs. Selwyn is verywell acquainted with Mrs. Beaumont.This morning I accompanied Mrs. Selwyn to Clifton Hill wherebeautifully situated is the house of Mrs. Beaumont. As we entered thehouse I summoned all my resolution to my aid determined rather to diethan to give Lord Orville reason to attribute my weakness to a wrongcause. On his seeing me he suddenly exclaimed "Miss Anville" and thenhe advanced and made his compliments to me with a countenance openmanly and charming a smile that indicated pleasure and eyes thatsparkled with delight. The very tone of his voice seemed flattering ashe congratulated himself upon his good fortune in meeting with me.During our ride home Mrs. Selwyn asked me if my health would now permitme to give up my morning walks to the pump-room for the purpose ofspending a week at Clifton and as my health is now very wellestablished to-morrow my dear sir we are to be actually the guests ofMrs. Beaumont. I am not much delighted at this scheme for greatly as Iam flattered by the attention of Lord Orville I cannot expect him tosupport it as long as a week.                                   We were received by Mrs. Beaumont with great civility and by LordOrville with something more.The attention with which he honours me seems to result from abenevolence of heart that proves him as much a stranger to caprice as topride. I am now not merely easy but even gay in his presence such is
comment292,the effect of true politeness that it banishes all restraint andembarrassment._VI.--A Happy Ending_EVELINA TO MR. VILLARSAnd now my dearest sir if the perturbation of my spirits will allowme I will finish my last letter from Clifton Hill.This morning when I went downstairs Lord Orville was the only personin the parlour. I felt no small confusion at seeing him alone afterhaving recently avoided him.As soon as the usual compliments were over I would have left the roombut he stopped me."I have for some time past most ardently desired an opportunity ofspeaking to you."I said nothing so he went on."I have been so unfortunate as to forfeit your friendship your eyeshuns mine and you sedulously avoid my conversation."I was extremely disconcerted at this grave but too just accusation butI made no answer."Tell me I beseech you what I have done and how to deserve yourpardon.""Oh my lord" I cried "I have never dreamt of offence if there is anypardon to be asked it is rather for me than for you to ask it.""You are all sweetness and condescension" cried he "but will youpardon a question essentially important to me Had or had not SirClement Willoughby any share in causing your inquietude""No my lord" answered I with firmness "none in the world. He is thelast man who would have any influence over my conduct."Just then Mrs. Beaumont opened the door and in a few minutes we went into breakfast. When she spoke of my journey a cloud overspread thecountenance of Lord Orville and on Mrs. Selwyn asking me to seek somebooks for her in the parlour I was followed by Lord Orville. He shutthe door and approached me with a look of great anxiety."You are going then" he cried taking my hand "and you give me notthe smallest hope of your return""Oh my lord" I said "surely your lordship is not so cruel as to mockme""Mock you" repeated he earnestly. "No I revere you You are dearer tome than language has the power of telling"I cannot write the scene that followed though every word is engraved onmy heart but his protestations his expressions were too flatteringfor repetition nor would he suffer me to escape until he had drawn fromme the most sacred secret of my heartTo be loved by Lord Orville to be the honoured choice of his nobleheart--my happiness seems too infinite to be borne.                                   I could not write yesterday so violent was the agitation of my mindbut I will not now lose a moment till I have hastened to my best friendan account of the transactions of the day.Mrs. Selwyn and I went early in Mrs. Beaumont's chariot to see myfather Sir John Belmont What a moment for your Evelina when taking myhand she led me forward into his presence. An involuntary screamescaped me covering my face with my hands I sank on the floor.He had however seen me first for in a voice scarce articulate heexclaimed "My God does Caroline Evelyn still live Lift up thy headif my sight has not blasted thee thou image of my long-lost Caroline"Affected beyond measure I half arose and embraced his knees."Yes yes" cried he looking earnestly in my face "I see thou art herchild She lives she is present to my view""Yes sir" cried I "it is your child if you will own her"
comment293,He knelt by my side and folded me in his arms. "Own thee" he repeated"yes my poor girl and heaven knows with what bitter contrition"                                   All is over my dearest sir and the fate of your Evelina is decidedThis morning with tearful joy and trembling gratitude she unitedherself for ever with the object of her dearest eternal affection.I have time for no more the chaise now waits which is to conduct me todear Berry Hill and the arms of the best of men.                                   WILLIAM CARLETONThe Black Prophet      William Carleton the Irish novelist was born in Co. Tyrone     on February 20 1794. His father was a small farmer the     father of fourteen children of whom William was the youngest.     After getting some education first from a hedge schoolmaster     and then from Dr. Keenan of Glasslough Carleton set out for     Dublin and obtained a tutorship. In 1830 he collected a number     of sketches and these were published under the title of     "Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry" and at once     enjoyed considerable popularity. In 1834 came "Tales of     Ireland" and from that time forward till his death Carleton     produced with great industry numerous short stories and     novels though none of his work after 1848 is worthy of his     reputation. "The Black Prophet" was published in 1847 and     Carleton believed rightly that it was his best work. It was     written in a season of unparalleled scarcity and destitution     and the pictures and scenes represented were those which he     himself witnessed in 1817 and 1822. Many of Carleton's novels     have been translated into French German and Italian and     they will always stand for faithful and powerful pictures of     Irish life and character. Carleton died in Dublin on January     30 1869._I.--The Murders in the Glen_The cabin of Donnel M'Gowan the Black Prophet stood at the foot of ahill near the mouth of a gloomy and desolate glen.In this glen not far from the cabin two murders had been committedtwenty years before. The one was that of a carman and the other a mannamed Sullivan and it was supposed they had been robbed. Neither of thebodies had ever been found. Sullivan's hat and part of his coat had beenfound on the following day in a field near the cabin and there was apool of blood where his foot-marks were deeply imprinted. A man namedDalton had been taken up under circumstances of great suspicion for thislatter murder for Dalton was the last person seen in Sullivan'scompany and both men had been drinking together in the market. Aquarrel had ensued blows had been exchanged and Dalton had threatenedhim in very strong language.No conviction was possible because of the disappearance of the body butDalton had remained under suspicion and the glen with its dark andgloomy aspect was said to be haunted by Sullivan's spirit and to beaccursed as the scene of crime and supernatural appearances.Within M'Gowan's cabin which bore every mark of poverty anddestitution a young girl about twenty-one of tall and slender figurewith hair black as the raven's wing and eyes dark and brilliantwrangled fiercely with an older woman her stepmother. From words theypassed to a fearful struggle of murderous passion.Presently Sarah the younger of the two started to her feet and fledout of the house to wash her hands and face at the river that flowedpast. Then she returned and spoke with frankness and good nature."I'm sorry for what I did. Forgive me mother You know I'm a hastydivil--for a divil's limb I am no doubt of it. Forgive me I say Donow here I'll get something to stop the blood"
comment294,She sprang at the moment with the agility of a wild cat upon an oldchest that stood in the corner of the hut. By stretching herself up toher full length she succeeded in pulling down several old cobwebs thathad been undisturbed for years and while doing so knocked down somemetallic substance which fell on the floor."Murdher alive mother" she exclaimed. "What is this Hallo atobaccy-box An' what's this on it Let me see. Two letters--a 'P' andan 'M.' 'P.M.'--arrah what can that be for Well divil may care. Letit lie on the shelf there. Here now none of your cross looks. I sayput these cobwebs to your face and they'll stop the bleedin'. And nowgood-night to you an' let that be a warnin' to you not to raise yourhand to me again."The girl went off to spend the night at a dance and a wake and thestepmother having dressed her wound as well as she could sat down bythe fire and began to ruminate.Presently she took up the tobacco-box and looking at it carefullyclasped her hands."It's the same" she exclaimed. "Oh merciful God it's thrue--it'sthrue I know it by the broken hinge an' the two letters Saviour oflife how will this end and what will I do But anyway I must hidethis and put it out of his reach."She accordingly went out and thrust the box up under the thatch of theroof so that it was impossible to suspect that the roof had beendisturbed._II.--The Prophet Schemes_That same evening Donnel was overtaken on the road from Ballynafail themarket-town by Jerry Sullivan a struggling farmer and they proceededtogether to the latter's house."This woful saison along wid the low prices and the high rents houldsout a black and terrible look for the counthry God help us" saidSullivan."Ay" returned the Black Prophet "if you only knew it. Isn't theAlmighty in His wrath this moment proclaimin' it through the heavensand the airth Look about you and say what is it you see that doesn'tforetell famine. Doesn't the dark wet day an' the rain rain rainforetell it Doesn't the rottin' crops the unhealthy air an' the greendamp foretell it Doesn't the sky without a sun the heavy clouds an'the angry fire of the west foretell it Isn't the airth a page ofprophecy an' the sky a page of prophecy where every man may read offamine pestilence an' death""The time was" said Sullivan "an' it's not long since when I couldgive you a comfortable welcome as well as a willin' one but now 'tisbut poor and humble tratement I can give you. But if it was betther youshould just be as welcome to it an' what more can you say""Well" replied the other "what more can you say indeed I'm thankfulto you Jerry an' I'll accept your kind offer."The night had set in when they reached the house where the traces ofpoverty were as visible upon the inmates as upon the furniture.Sullivan was strangely excited--he had discovered a stolen interviewoutside between his eldest daughter and young Condy Dalton.Mave Sullivan--a young creature of nineteen of rare natural beauty andangelic purity--turned deadly pale when her father spoke."Bridget" Sullivan said turning to his wife "I tell you that I came
comment295,upon that undutiful daughter of ours coortin' wid the son of the manthat murdhered her uncle my only brother--coortin' wid a fellow thatDan M'Gowan here knows will be hanged yet for he's jist afther tellin'him so.""You're ravin' Jerry" exclaimed his wife. "You don't mean to tell methat she'd spake to or make any freedoms whatsomever wid young CondyDalton Hut no Jerry don't say that at all events"But Sullivan's indignation passed quickly to alarm and distress for hisdaughter tottered and would have fallen to the ground if Donnel had notcaught her."Save me from that man" she shrieked at Donnel clinging to her mother."Don't let him near me I can't tell why but I am deadly afraid ofhim"Her parents already sorry for their harsh words tried their utmost toconsole her."Don't be alarmed my purty creature" said the Black Prophet softly. "Isee a great good fortune before you. I see a grand and handsome husbandand a fine house to live in. Grandeur and wealth is before her for herbeauty an' her goodness will bring it all about."When the family after the father had offered up a few simple prayersretired to rest Sullivan took down his brother's old great coat andplaced it over M'Gowan who was already in bed. But the latterimmediately sat up and implored him to take it away.Next morning before departing Donnel repeated to Mave Sullivan hisprophecy of the happy and prosperous marriage.But Mave who knew where her affection rested found no comfort in thesepredictions for the Daltons were pressed as hard by poverty as theirneighbours.As for Donnel M'Gowan cunning and unscrupulous his plan was to secureMave for young Dick o' the Grange a small landowner and a profligate.To do this he relied on the help of his daughter Sarah and wasdisappointed. For Sarah was to find Mave Sullivan her friend and sherenounced her father's scheme so that no harm happened to the girl._III.--The Shadow of Crime_With famine came typhus fever and the state of the country wasfrightful beyond belief. Thousands were reduced to mendicancy numbersperished on the very highways and the road was literally black withfunerals. Temporary sheds were erected near the roadsides containingfever-stricken patients who had no other home.Under the ravening madness of famine legal restraints and moralprinciples were forgotten and famine riots broke out. For studded overthe country were a number of farmers with bursting granaries who couldafford to keep their provisions in large quantities until a year ofscarcity and high prices arrived and the people exasperated beyondendurance saw long lines of provision carts on their way to theneighbouring harbours for exportation.Such was the extraordinary factDay after day vessels laden with Irish provisions drawn from apopulation perishing with actual hunger and with pestilence which itoccasioned were passing out of our ports whilst other vessels came infreighted with our provisions sent back through the charity of Englandto our relief.Goaded by suffering hordes of people turned out to intercept meal-cartsand provision vehicles and carts and cars were stopped on the highwaysand the food which they carried openly taken away.Sarah M'Gowan herself went to the Daltons where typhus and starvationwere doing their worst to render what service she could and MaveSullivan would have done the same but for the entreaties of her parentswho feared the terrible fever.
comment296,The Black Prophet alone went on his way unmoved scheming to accomplishhis vile ends. It was not enough for him that Mave was to be abductedhe had also planned a robbery for the same night and was furtherresolved to procure the conviction of old Condy Dalton for the almostforgotten murder of Sullivan in the glen.M'Gowan was driven to this last step by his own disturbed mind. Thedisappearance of the tobacco-box troubled him for on seeking it underthe thatch it was no longer there and the discovery by his wife of askeleton buried near their cabin caused him still greater uneasiness.Then Sarah had followed him one night when he was walking in his sleepto the secret grave of the murdered man and though the Prophet did notsay anything on that occasion to incriminate himself he was vexed bythe occurrence.So on the information of Donnel M'Gowan and a man called Roddy Duncanwho was deep in the Prophet's subtle villainies the skeleton was dugup and old Condy Dalton arrested."It's the will of God" replied the old man when the police-officersentered his unhappy dwelling and charged him with the murder ofBartholomew Sullivan. "It's God's will an' I won't consale it anylonger. Take me away. I'm guilty--I'm guilty"Sarah was ministering to the Daltons at the very time when her fatherwas informing against old Condy and was present when the police tookhim away in custody. Shortly afterwards when she had left the houseshe was struck down by typhus.In a shed that simply consisted of a few sticks laid up against the sideof a ditch with the remnant of some loose straw for bedding MaveSullivan found the suffering girl with no other pillow than a sod ofearth."Father of mercy" thought Mave "how will she live--how can she livehere An' is she to die in this miserable way in a Christian land"Sarah lay groaning with pain and then raving in delirium."I won't break my promise father but I'll break my heart an' I can'teven give her warning. Ah but it's treachery an' I hate that. No noI'll have no hand in it--manage it your own way""Dear Sarah don't you know me" said Mave tenderly. "Look at me--I amMave Sullivan your friend that loves you.""Who is that" Sarah asked starting a little. "I never had anyone totake care o' me--nor a mother many a time--often--often--the wholeworld--some one to love me. Oh a dhrink Is there no one to give me adhrink I'm burning I'm burning Mave Sullivan have pity on me--Iheard some one name her--I'll die without you give me a dhrink"Mave hastily fetched some water and in the course of two or three daysSarah's situation thanks to the attention of Mave and her neighbourswas changed for the better and she was conveyed home to the Prophet'scabin on a litter--only to die in a few days.It was the knowledge of what she owed Mave that forced Sarah tofrustrate her father's plot for Mave's ruin.The robbery was no more successful than the abduction for Roddy Duncanwithdrew from it and Donnel M'Gowan learnt that the house to beplundered was well guarded._IV.--An Amazing Witness_The court was crowded when Cornelius Dalton was put to the bar chargedwith the wilful murder of Bartholomew Sullivan by striking him on thehead with a walking stick and when the old man stood up all eyes wereturned on him. It was clear that there was an admission of guilt in hisface for instead of appearing erect and independent he looked aroundwith an expression of remorse and sorrow and it was with difficultythat he was prevailed upon to plead "not guilty."The first witness called was Jeremiah Sullivan who deposed that at oneof the Christmas markets in 1798 he was present when an altercation tookplace between his late brother Bartle and the prisoner. They were bothdrinking and their friends separated them. He never saw his brotheralive afterwards. He then deposed to the finding of his brother's coat
comment297,and hat crushed and torn.The next witness was Roddy Duncan who deposed that on the night inquestion he was passing on a car and saw a man drag something heavylike a sack. He then called out was that Condy Dalton And the replywas "It is unfortunately" upon which he wished him good-night.Next came the Prophet. He said he was on his way through Glendhu whenhe came to a lonely spot where he found the body of BartholomewSullivan and beside it a grave dug two feet deep. He then caught aglimpse of the prisoner Condy Dalton among the bushes with a spade inhis hand. He shouted out and getting no answer was glad to get offsafe.On the cross-examination he said "the reason why he let the matter restuntil now was that he did not wish to be the means of bringin' afellow-creature to an untimely death. His conscience however alwayskept him uneasy and many a time of late the murdhered man appeared tohim and threatened him for not disclosing what he knew.""You say the murdered man appeared to you. Which of them""Peter Magennis--what am I sayin' I mean Bartle Sullivan."The counsel for the defence requested the judge and jury to make a noteof Peter Magennis and then asked the Prophet what kind of a man BartleSullivan was."He was a very remarkable man in appearance stout with a long faceand a scar on his chin.""And you saw that man murdered""I seen him dead after havin' been murdhered.""Do you think now if he were to rise again from the grave that youwould know him"Then the counsel turned round spoke to some person behind and astranger advanced and mounted a table confronting the Black Prophet."Whether you seen me dead or buried is best known to yourself" said thestranger. "All I can say is that here I am Bartle Sullivan alive an'well."Hearing the name crowds pressed forward recognising Bartle Sullivanand testifying their recognition by a general cheer.There were two persons present however Condy Dalton and the Propheton whom Sullivan's appearance produced very opposite effects.Old Dalton at first imagined himself in a dream and it was only whenSullivan promising to explain all came over and shook hands with himand asked his pardon that the old man understood he was innocent.The Prophet looked with mortification rather than wonder at Sullivanthen a shadow settled on his countenance and he muttered to himself "Iam doomed Something drove me to this."The trial was quickly ended. Sullivan's brother and several jurorsestablished his identity and Condy Dalton was discharged.
comment298,The judge then ordered the Prophet and Roddy Duncan to be taken intocustody and an indictment of perjury to be prepared at once. The gravercharge of murder was however brought against M'Gowan the murder of acarman named Peter Magennis and the following day he found himself inthe very dock where Dalton had stood._V.--Fate the Discoverer_The trial of Donnel M'Gowan brought several strange things to light. Itwas proved that the Prophet's real name was McIvor that he had a wifeliving and that this wife was a sister to the murdered carman PeterMagennis. After the murder McIvor fled to America with his daughterand his wife lost sight of him. She had only returned to these partsrecently and she identified the skeleton of her brother because of acertain malformation of the foot.Then a pedlar known in the neighbourhood as Toddy Mack deposed that hehad given Magennis a steel tobacco-box with the letters "P. M." punchedon it.It was Roddy Duncan who had seen this tobacco-box put under the thatchand he knowing nothing of its history had given it to Sarah M'Gowanwho equally ignorant had given it to a young man who called himselfHanlon but was in fact the son of Magennis.On the night of the murder the unhappy woman whom Sarah calledstepmother and who lived with the Black Prophet saw the tobacco-box inM'Gowan's hands and it contained a roll of bank-notes. When she askedhow he came by it he gave her a note and said "There's all theexplanation you can want."The chain of circumstantial evidence was sufficient to establish theProphet's guilt and the judge passed the capital sentence.The Prophet heard his doom without flinching and only turned to thegaoler to say "Now that everything is over the sooner I get to my cellthe betther. I have despised the world too long to care a single cursewhat it says or thinks about me."Sarah who heard of her father's fate while she lay dying tended byMave Sullivan and her newly-discovered mother sent the condemned man alast message. "Say that his daughter if she was able would be with himthrough shame an' disgrace an' death that she'd scorn the world forhim an' that because he said once in his life that he loved her she'dforgive him all a thousand times an' would lay down her life for him."The acquittal of old Condy Dalton who for years had tortured himselfwith remorse believing he had killed Sullivan and never understandingthe disappearance of the body and the resurrection of honest BartleSullivan filled all the countryside with delight.Thanks to the money of his friend Toddy Mack Dalton was once morere-established in a farm that he had been compelled to relinquish andwhen sickness and the severity of winter passed away Mave and youngCondy Dalton were happily married.Roddy Duncan was transported for perjury. Bartle Sullivan on the first
comment299,social evening that the two families the Sullivans and the Daltonsspent together after the trial cleared up the mystery of hisdisappearance."I remimber fightin'" he said "wid Condy on that night and thedevil's own battle it was. We went into a corner of the field near theGrey Stone to decide it. All at wanst I forgot what happened till Ifound myself lyin' upon a car wid the McMahons that lived ten or twelvemiles beyond the mountains. Well I felt disgraced at bein' beaten byCon Dalton and as I was fond of McMahon's sister what 'ud you have usbut off we went together to America for you see she promised to marryme if I'd go. Well she an' I married when we got to Boston and Toddyhere who took to the life of a pedlar came back with a good purse andlived wid us. At last I began to long for home and so we all cametogether. An' thank God we were all in time to clear the innocent andpunish the guilty ay an' reward the good too eh Toddy"                                   LEWIS CARROLLAlice's Adventures in Wonderland      The proper name of Lewis Carroll was Charles Lutwidge     Dodgson and he was born at Daresbury England on January 27     1832. Educated at Rugby and at Christchurch Oxford he     specialised in mathematical subjects. Elected a student of his     college he became a mathematical lecturer in 1855 continuing     in that occupation until 1881. His fame rests on the     children's classic "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" issued     in 1865 which has been translated into many languages. No     modern fairy-tale has approached it in popularity. The charms     of the book are its unstrained humour and its childlike fancy     held in check by the discretion of a particularly clear and     analytical mind. Though it seems strange that an authority on     Euclid and logic should have been the inventor of so diverting     and irresponsible a tale if we examine his story critically     we shall see that only a logical mind could have derived so     much genuine humour from a deliberate attack on reason in     which a considerable element of fun arises from efforts to     reconcile the irreconcilable. The book has probably been read     as much by grown-ups as by young people and no work of humour     is more heartily to be commended as a banisher of care. The     original illustrations by Sir John Tenniel are almost as     famous as the book itself._I.--What Happened Down the Rabbit-Hole_Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on thebank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into thebook her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations init "and what is the use of a book" thought Alice "without pictures orconversations"So she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for thehot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure ofmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up andpicking the daisies when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ranclose by her.There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that nor did Alice think itso very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to himself "Ohdear Oh dear I shall be too late" But when the Rabbit actually _tooka watch out of his waistcoat pocket_ and looked at it and then hurriedon Alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that shehad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watchto take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the fieldafter him and was just in time to see him pop down a large rabbit-holeunder the hedge.In another moment down went Alice after him never once considering howin the world she was to get out again.The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and thendipped suddenly down so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to thinkabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemedto be a very deep well.Either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she hadplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
comment300,was going to happen next."Well" thought Alice to herself "after such a fall as this I shallthink nothing of tumbling downstairs."Down down down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end "I wonder if Ishall fall right _through_ the earth How funny it'll seem to come outamong the people that walk with their heads downwards The AntipathiesI think" she was rather glad there was no one listening this time asit didn't sound at all the right word.Down down down. Then suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heapof sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over.Alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment.She looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another longpassage and the White Rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it.There was not a moment to be lost. Away went Alice like the wind andwas just in time to hear him say as he turned a corner "Oh my earsand whiskers how late it is getting" She was close behind him when sheturned the corner but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen. She foundherself in a long narrow hall which was lit up by lamps hanging fromthe roof.In the hall she came upon a little three-legged table all made of solidglass. There was nothing on it but a tiny golden key and Alice's firstidea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall butalas either the locks were too large or the key was too small for atany rate it would not open any of them. However on the second timeround she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before andbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. She tried thelittle golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted.Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage notmuch larger than a rat-hole. She knelt down and looked along the passageinto the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out ofthat dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers andthose cool fountains but she could not even get her head through thedoorway.There seemed to be no use in waiting near the little door so she wentback to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or atany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes. Thistime she found a little bottle on it "which certainly was not herebefore" said Alice and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paperlabel with the words DRINK ME beautifully printed on it in largeletters. Alice tasted it and very soon finished it off."What a curious feeling" said Alice. "I must be shutting up like atelescope."And so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her facebrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for goingthrough the little door into that lovely garden.... But alas for poorAlice when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the littlegolden key and when she went back to the table for it she found shecould not possibly reach it.Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table.She opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words EATME were beautifully marked in currants.She very soon finished off the cake."Curiouser and curiouser" cried Alice she was so much surprised thatfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English. "Now I'mopening out like the largest telescope that ever was. Good-by feet"
comment301,for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out ofsight they were getting so far off. "Oh my poor little feet I wonderwho will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears"Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall infact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up thelittle golden key and hurried off to the garden door.Poor Alice It was as much as she could do lying down on one side tolook through into the garden with one eye but to get through was morehopeless than ever. She sat down and began to cry again sheddinggallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about fourinches deep and reaching half down the hall.After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance andshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the WhiteRabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves inone hand and a large fan in the other. He came trotting along in a greathurry muttering to himself as he came "Oh the Duchess the DuchessOr won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting"Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of anyone sowhen the Rabbit came near her she began in a timid voice "If youplease sir----"The Rabbit started violently dropped the gloves and the fan andscurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.Alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot shekept fanning herself all the time she went on talking."Dear dear How queer everything is to-day How puzzling it all isI'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see four timesfive is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times sevenis--oh dear I shall never get to twenty at that rate" But presentlyon looking down at her hands she was surprised to see that she had puton one of the rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking."How _can_ I have done that" she thought. "I must be growing smallagain."She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and foundthat as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high andwas going on shrinking rapidly. She soon found out that the cause ofthis was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just intime to save herself from shrinking away altogether. Now she hastened tothe little door but alas it was shut again. "I declare it's too bad
comment302,that it is" she said aloud and just as she spoke her foot slipped andin another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water. It wasthe pool of tears she had wept when she was nine feet high_II.--The Pool of Tears and the Animals' Party_Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little wayoff and she swam nearer to make out what it was. At first she thoughtit must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how smallshe was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that hadslipped in like herself."Would it be of any use now" thought Alice "to speak to this mouseEverything is so out-of-the-way down here that I should think verylikely it can talk at any rate there's no harm in trying." So shebegan "O Mouse do you know the way out of this pool I am very tiredof swimming about here. O Mouse." The Mouse looked at her ratherinquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyesbut it said nothing."Perhaps it doesn't understand English" thought Alice "I daresay it'sa French mouse come over with William the Conqueror." So she beganagain "_ou est ma chatte_" which was the first sentence in her Frenchlesson book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemedto quiver all over with fright. "Oh I beg your pardon" cried Alicehastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feeling. "I quiteforgot you don't like cats.""Not like cats" cried the Mouse in a shrill passionate voice. "Would_you_ like cats if you were me" The Mouse was swimming away from her ashard as it could go. So she called softly after it."Mouse dear Do come back again and we won't talk about cats or dogseither if you don't like them" When the Mouse heard this it turnedround and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale withpassion Alice thought and it said in a low trembling voice "Let usget to the shore and I'll tell you my history and you'll understandwhy it is I hate cats and dogs."It was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with thebirds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodoa lory and an eaglet and other curious creatures. Alice led the wayand the whole party swam to the shore.A very queer-looking party of dripping birds and animals now gathered onthe bank of the Pool of Tears but they were not so queer as their talk.First the Mouse who was quite a person of authority among them triedto dry them by telling them frightfully dry stories from history. ButAlice confessed she was as wet as ever after she had listened to the
comment303,bits of English history so the Dodo proposed a Caucus race. They allstarted off when they liked and stopped when they liked. The Dodo saideverybody had won and Alice had to give the prizes. Luckily she hadsome sweets which were not wet and there was just one for each ofthem but none for herself. The party were anxious she too should havea prize and as she happened to have a thimble the Dodo commanded herto hand it to him and then with great ceremony the Dodo presented itto her saying "We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble" andthey all cheered.Of course Alice thought this all very absurd but they were dry nowand began eating their sweets. Then the Mouse began to tell Alice itshistory and to explain why it hated C and D--for it was afraid to saycats and dogs. But she soon offended the Mouse first by mistaking its"long and sad tale" for a "long tail" and next by thinking it meant"knot" when it said "not" so that it went off in a huff. Then when shementioned Dinah to the others and told them that was the name of hercat the birds got uneasy and one by one the whole party gradually wentoff and left her all alone. Just when she was beginning to cry sheheard a pattering of little feet and half thought it might be the Mousecoming back to finish its story.It was the White Rabbit trotting slowly back again and lookinganxiously about as he went as if he had lost something and she heardhim muttering to himself "The Duchess The Duchess Oh my dear pawsOh my fur and whiskers She'll get me executed as sure as ferrets areferrets Where _can_ I have dropped them I wonder"Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice and called out to her in an angrytone "Why Mary Ann what _are_ you doing out here Run home thismoment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan. Quick now""He took me for his housemaid" she said to herself as she ran. "Howsurprised he'll be when he finds out who I am But I'd better take himhis fan and gloves--that is if I can find them." As she said this shecame upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brassplate with the name W. RABBIT engraved upon it. Inside the house she hada strange adventure for she tried what the result of drinking from abottle she found in the room would be and grew so large that the housecould hardly hold her. The White Rabbit and some of his friendsincluding Bill the Lizard threw a lot of little pebbles through thewindow and these turned into tiny cakes. So Alice ate some and wasdelighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she wassmall enough to get through the door she ran out of the house andfound quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. Thepoor Lizard Bill was in the middle being held up by two guinea-pigswho were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush atAlice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could andsoon found herself safe in a thick wood._III.--The Adventures in the Wood_Once in the wood she was anxious to get back to her right size againand then to get into that lovely garden. But how Peeping over amushroom she beheld a large blue caterpillar sitting on the top withits arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not thesmallest notice of her or of anything else. At length in a sleepy sortof way it began talking to her and she told it what she wanted somuch--to grow to her right size again."I should like to be a _little_ longer" she said. "Three inches is sucha wretched height to be.""It is a very good height indeed" said the Caterpillar angrily rearingitself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high."But I'm not used to it" pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And shethought to herself "I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easilyoffended.""You'll get used to it in time" said the Caterpillar and it put thehookah into its mouth and began smoking again.This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In aminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and
comment304,yawned once or twice and shook itself. Then it got down off themushroom and crawled away into the grass merely remarking as it went"One side will make you grow taller and the other side will make yougrow shorter.""One side of _what_ The other side of what" thought Alice to herself."Of the mushroom" said the Caterpillar just as if she had asked italoud and in another moment it was out of sight.Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute tryingto make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectlyround she found this a very difficult question. However at last shestretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bitof the edge with each hand."And now which is which" she said to herself and nibbled a little ofthe right-hand bit to try the effect. The next moment she felt a violentblow underneath her chin it had struck her footShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she feltthat there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so sheset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressedso closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open hermouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of theleft-hand bit.The next minute she had grown so tall that her neck rose like a stalkout of a sea of green leaves and these green leaves were the trees ofthe wood. But by nibbling bits of mushroom she at last succeeded inbringing herself down to her usual height. But oh dear in order to getinto the first house she saw she had to eat some more of the mushroomfrom her right hand and bring herself down to nine inches. Outside thehouse she saw the Fish-footmen and the Frog-footmen with invitationsfrom the Queen to the Duchess asking her to play croquet. The Duchesslived in the house and a terrible noise was going on inside and whenthe door was opened a plate came crashing out. But Alice got in at lastand found a strange state of things. The Duchess and her cook werequarrelling because there was too much pepper in the soup. The cookthrew everything she could lay hands on at the Duchess and nearlyknocked the baby's nose off with a saucepan.The Duchess had the baby in her lap and tossed it about ridiculouslyfinally throwing it in the most heartless way to Alice. She took it outof doors and behold it turned into a little pig jumped out of herarms and ran away into the wood."If it had grown up" she said "it would have made a dreadfully uglychild but it makes rather a handsome pig I think."She was a little startled now by seeing the Cheshire Cat--which she hadfirst seen in the house of the Duchess--sitting on a bough of a tree.The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured she
comment305,thought still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth so shefelt that it ought to be treated with respect."Cheshire Puss" she said "what sort of people live about here""In _that_ direction" the Cat said waving its right paw round "livesa Hatter and in _that_ direction"--waving the other paw--"lives a MarchHare. Visit either you like they're both mad."She had not gone very far before she came in sight of the house of theMarch Hare. She thought it must be the right house because the chimneyswere shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was solarge a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbledsome more of the left-hand bit of mushroom and raised herself to abouttwo feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly sayingto herself "Suppose it should be raving mad after all. I almost wishI'd gone to see the Hatter instead."_IV.--Alice at the Mad Tea Party_There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and theMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it a Dormouse was sittingbetween them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushionresting their elbows on it and talking over its head.The table was a large one but the three were all crowded together atone corner."No room No room" they cried out when they saw Alice coming."There's _plenty_ of room" said Alice indignantly. And she sat down ina large armchair at one end of the table."What day of the month is it" asked the Hatter turning to Alice.He had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasilyshaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear.Alice considered a little and said "The fourth.""Two days wrong" sighed the Hatter. "I told you butter wouldn't suitthe works" he added looking angrily at the March Hare."It was the _best_ butter" the March Hare meekly replied."But some crumbs must have got in as well" the Hatter grumbled. "Youshouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife."The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dippedit into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think ofnothing better to say than "It was the _best_ butter you know.""It's always tea-time with us here" explained the Hatter "and we've notime to wash the things between whiles.""Then you keep moving round I suppose" said Alice."Exactly so" said the Hatter "as the things get used up.""But when you come to the beginning again" Alice ventured to ask."Suppose we change the subject" the March Hare interrupted yawning. "Ivote the young lady tells us a story.""I'm afraid I don't know one" said Alice rather alarmed at theproposal."Then the Dormouse shall" they both cried. "Wake up the Dormouse" Andthey pinched it on both sides at once.The Dormouse slowly opened its eyes. "I wasn't asleep" it said in ahoarse feeble voice. "I heard every word you fellows were saying.""Tell us a story" said the March Hare."Yes please do" pleaded Alice."And be quick about it" added the Hatter "or you'll be asleep againbefore it's done."
comment306,"Once upon a time there were three little sisters" the Dormouse beganin a great hurry "and their names were Elsie Lacie and Tillie andthey lived at the bottom of a well----""What did they live on" said Alice who always took a great interest inquestions of eating and drinking."They lived on treacle" said the Dormouse after thinking a minute ortwo."They couldn't have done that you know" Alice gently remarked "they'dhave been ill.""So they were _very_ ill."Alice helped herself to some tea and bread and butter and then turnedto the Dormouse and repeated her question "Why did they live at thebottom of the well"The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and thensaid "It was a treacle-well.""There's no such thing" Alice was beginning very angrily but theHatter and the March Hare went "Sh sh""I want a clean cup" interrupted the Hatter. "Let's all move one placeon." He moved on as he spoke and the Dormouse followed him the MarchHare moved into the Dormouse's place and Alice rather unwillingly tookthe place of the March Hare."They were learning to draw" the Dormouse went on yawning and rubbingits eyes for it was getting very sleepy "and they drew all manner ofthings--everything that begins with an M----""Why with an M" said Alice."Why not" said the March Hare.The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into adoze but on being pinched by the Hatter it woke up again with alittle shriek and went on "----that begins with an M such asmouse-traps and the moon and memory and muchness--you know you saythings are 'much of a muchness'--did you ever see such a thing as adrawing of a muchness""Really now you ask me" said Alice confused "I don't think----""Then you shouldn't talk" said the Hatter.This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear she got up indisgust and walked off. The Dormouse fell asleep instantly and neitherof the others took the least notice of her going though she looked backonce or twice half hoping that they would call after her.The last time she saw them they were trying to put the Dormouse intothe teapot._V.--The Mock Turtle's Story and the Lobster Quadrille_Alice got into the beautiful garden at last but she had to nibble a bit
comment307,of the mushroom again to bring herself down to twelve inches after shehad got the golden key so as to get through the little door. It was alovely garden and in it was the Queen's croquet-ground. The Queen ofHearts was very fond of ordering heads to be cut off. "Off with hishead" was her favourite phrase whenever anybody displeased her. Sheasked Alice to play croquet with her but they had no rules they hadlive flamingoes for mallets and the soldiers had to stand on theirhands and feet to form the hoops. It was extremely awkward especiallyas the balls were hedgehogs who sometimes rolled away without beinghit. The Queen had a great quarrel with the Duchess and wanted to haveher head off.Alice found the state of affairs in the lovely garden not at all sobeautiful as she had expected. But after the game of croquet the Queensaid to Alice "Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet""No" said Alice. "I don't even know what a mock turtle is.""It's the thing mock turtle soup is made from" said the Queen."I never saw one or heard of one.""Come on then" said the Queen "and he shall tell you his history."They very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun."Up lazy thing" said the Queen "and take this young lady to see theMock Turtle and to hear his history. I must go back and see after someexecutions I have ordered." And she walked off leaving Alice alone withthe Gryphon.Alice and the Gryphon had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtlein the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock andas they came nearer Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart wouldbreak.So they went up to the Mock Turtle who looked at them with large eyesfull of tears."This here young lady" said the Gryphon "she wants for to know yourhistory.""Once" said the Mock Turtle at last with a deep sigh "I was a realturtle. When we were little we went to school in the sea. The masterwas an old turtle. We had the best of educations. Reeling and Writhingof course to begin with and then the different branches ofArithmetic--Ambition Distraction Uglification and Derision.""I never heard of 'Uglification'" Alice ventured to say. "What is it"The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise."Never heard of uglifying" it exclaimed. "You know what to beautify isI suppose""Yes" said Alice doubtfully "it means to--make--anything--prettier.""Well then" the Gryphon went on "if you don't know what to uglify isyou _are_ a simpleton."Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so sheturned to the Mock Turtle and said "What else had you to learn"
comment308,"Well there was Mystery" the Mock Turtle replied counting out thesubjects on his flappers--"Mystery ancient and modern with Seaographythen Drawling--the Drawing-master was an old conger-eel that used tocome once a week _he_ taught us Drawling Stretching and Fainting inCoils. The Classical master taught Laughing and Grief they used tosay.""And how many hours a day did you do lessons" said Alice in a hurry tochange the subject."Ten hours the first day" said the Mock Turtle "nine the next and soon.""What a curious plan" exclaimed Alice."That's the reason they're called lessons" the Gryphon remarked"because they lessen from day to day."This was quite a new idea to Alice and she thought it over a littlebefore she made her next remark. "Then the eleventh day must have been aholiday""Of course it was" said the Mock Turtle."And how did you manage on the twelfth" Alice went on eagerly."That's enough about lessons" the Gryphon interrupted in a verydecided tone. "Tell her something about the games."The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper acrosshis eyes."Would you like to see a little of a Lobster Quadrille" said he toAlice."Very much indeed" said Alice."Let's try the first figure" said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. "Wecan do without lobsters you know. Which shall sing""Oh _you_ sing" said the Gryphon. "I've forgotten the words."So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice every now and thentreading on her toes when they passed too close and waving theirfore-paws to mark the time while the Mock Turtle sang this very slowlyand sadly.    "Will you walk a little faster" said a whiting to a snail    "There's a porpoise close behind us and he's treading on my tail.    See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance    They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance    Will you won't you will you won't you will you join the dance    Will you won't you will you won't you won't you join the dance""Now come let's hear some of _your_ adventures" said the Gryphon toAlice after the dance."I could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning" saidAlice a little timidly "but it's no use going back to yesterdaybecause I was a different person then.""Explain all that" said the Mock Turtle."No no the adventure first" said the Gryphon impatiently."Explanations take such a dreadful time."So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she firstsaw the White Rabbit. After a while a cry of "The Trial's beginning"was heard in the distance."Come on" cried the Gryphon. And taking Alice by the hand it hurriedoff."What trial is it" Alice panted as she ran but the Gryphon onlyanswered "Come on" and ran the faster._VI.--The Trial of the Knave of Hearts_The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when theyarrived with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of littlebirds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards. The Knave wasstanding before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guardhim and near the King was the White Rabbit with a trumpet in one handand a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the courtwas a table with a large dish of tarts upon it. They looked so goodthat it made Alice quite hungry to look at them. "I wish they'd get thetrial done" she thought "and hand round the refreshments." But thereseemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything abouther to pass away the time."Silence in the court" cried the Rabbit."Herald read the accusation" said the King.On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and thenunrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows.    The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts      All on a summer's day    The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts      And took them quite away."Consider your verdict" the King said to the jury."Not yet not yet" the Rabbit hastily interrupted. "There's a greatdeal to come before that""Call the first witness" said the King and the White Rabbit blew three
comment309,blasts on the trumpet and called out "First witness"The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one handand a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. "I beg pardon yourMajesty" he began "for bringing these in but I hadn't quite finishedmy tea when I was sent for.""Take off your hat" the King said to the Hatter."It isn't mine" said the Hatter."_Stolen_" the King exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly madea memorandum of the fact."I keep them to sell" the Hatter added as an explanation "I've none ofmy own. I'm a hatter."Here the Queen put on her spectacles and began staring hard at theHatter who turned pale and fidgeted."Give your evidence" said the King "and don't be nervous or I'll haveyou executed on the spot."This did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting fromone foot to the other looking uneasily at the Queen and in hisconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of thebread-and-butter.Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzledher a good deal until she made out what it was. She was beginning togrow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leavethe court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was aslong as there was room for her."I'm a poor man your Majesty" the Hatter began in a trembling voice"and I hadn't but just begun my tea--not above a week or so--and whatwith the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of thetea----""The twinkling of _what_" said the King."It _began_ with the tea" said the Hatter."Of course twinkling begins with a T" said the King sharply. "Do youtake me for a dunce Go on""I'm a poor man" the Hatter went on "and most things twinkled afterthat--only the March Hare said----""I didn't" the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry."You did" said the Hatter."I deny it" said the March Hare."He denies it" said the King "leave out that part. And if that's allyou know about it you may go" said the King and the Hatter hurriedlyleft the court without even waiting to put on his shoes. "--and justtake his head off outside" the Queen added to one of the officers butthe Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door."Call the next witness" said the King.Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling verycurious to see what the next witness would be like "for they haven'tgot much evidence _yet_" she said to herself. Imagine her surprise whenthe White Rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice thename "Alice""Here" cried Alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment howlarge she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such ahurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirtupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and therethey lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe ofgold-fish she had accidentally upset the week before."Oh I _beg_ your pardon" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay andbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could.As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of beingupset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back tothem they set to work very diligently to write out a history of theaccident all except the Lizard who seemed too much overcome to doanything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof."What do you know about this business" the King said to Alice."Nothing" said Alice."Nothing _whatever_" persisted the King."Nothing whatever" said Alice."That's very important" the King said turning to the jury. They werejust beginning to write this down on their slates when the White Rabbitinterrupted."_Un_important your Majesty means of course" he said in a very
comment310,respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him."_Un_nimportant of course I meant" the King hastily said and went onto himself in an undertone "important--unimportant--unimportant--important----" as if he were trying which word sounded best.Presently the King who had been for some time busily writing in hisnotebook called out "Silence" and he read out from his book "RuleForty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_."Everybody looked at Alice."_I'm_ not a mile high" said Alice."You are" said the King."Nearly two miles high" added the Queen."Well I shan't go at any rate" said Alice. "Besides that's not aregular rule you invented it just now.""It's the oldest rule in the book" said the King."Then it ought to be Number One" said Alice.The King turned pale and shut his notebook hastily. "Consider yourverdict" he said to the jury in a low trembling voice."No no" said the Queen. "Sentence first--verdict afterwards.""Stuff and nonsense" said Alice loudly. "The idea of having thesentence first""Hold your tongue" said the Queen."I won't" said Alice."Off with her head" the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobodymoved."Who cares for you" said Alice she had grown to her full size by thistime. "You're nothing but a pack of cards"At this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down uponher she gave a little scream and tried to beat them off and foundherself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister whowas gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down fromthe trees on her face."Wake up Alice dear" said her sister. "Why what a long sleep you'vehad""Oh I've had such a curious dream" said Alice and she told hersister as well as she could remember them all her strange adventuresand when she had finished her sister kissed her and said "It _was_ acurious dream dear certainly. But now run in to your tea it's gettinglate."So Alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she mightwhat a wonderful dream it had been.                                   MIGUEL CERVANTESLife and Adventures of Don Quixote      Miguel Cervantes the son of poor but gentle parents was     born nobody quite knows where in Spain in the year 1547. His     favourite amusement when a boy was the performance of     strolling players. He learned grammar and the humanities under     Lopez de Hoyos at Madrid but did not it seems proceed to     the university. He was an early writer of sonnets and tried     his hand on a pastoral poem before he had grown moustaches.     His first acquaintance with the world was acting as     chamberlain in the house of a cardinal but this life he     presently abandoned for the more stirring career of a soldier.     After incredible sufferings and adventures the poor private     soldier returned wounded to his family and began his career as     author. He soon established a reputation and was able to     marry a quite adorable good lady with dowry sufficient for his     needs. However it was not until late in life that he wrote     his immortal work "Don Quixote" which saw the light in 1604     or 1605. During the remainder of his life he was bitterly     assailed by the envious and malignant was seldom out of     monetary difficulties and very often in great pain from the     disease which finally ended his career at Madrid on April 23     1616--the same day which saw the close of Shakespeare's._I.--The Knight-Errant of La Mancha_In a certain village of La Mancha there lived one of thoseold-fashioned gentlemen who keep a lance in the rack an ancient targeta lean horse and a greyhound for coursing. His family consisted of ahousekeeper turned forty a niece not twenty and a man who could saddlea horse handle the pruning-hook and also serve in the house. Themaster himself was nigh fifty years of age lean-bodied and thin-facedan early riser and a great lover of hunting. His surname was Quixadaor Quesada.You must know now that when our gentleman had nothing to do--which was
comment311,almost all the year round--he read books on knight-errantry and withsuch delight that he almost left off his sports and even sold acres ofland to buy these books. He would dispute with the curate of the parishand with the barber as to the best knight in the world. At nights heread these romances until it was day a-day he would read until it wasnight. Thus by reading much and sleeping little he lost the use of hisreason. His brain was full of nothing but enchantments quarrelsbattles challenges wounds amorous plaints torments and abundance ofimpossible follies.Having lost his wits he stumbled on the oddest fancy that ever enteredmadman's brain--to turn knight-errant mount his steed and armed_cap--pie_ ride through the world redressing all manner ofgrievances and exposing himself to every danger that he might purchaseeverlasting honour and renown.The first thing he did was to secure a suit of armour that had belongedto his great-grandfather. Then he made himself a helmet which his sworddemolished at the first stroke. After repairing this mischief he wentto visit his horse whose bones stuck out but who appeared to hismaster a finer beast than Alexander's Bucephalus. After four days ofthought he decided to call his horse Rozinante and when the title wasdecided upon he spent eight days more before he arrived at Don Quixoteas a name for himself.And now he perceived that nothing was wanting save only a lady on whomhe might bestow the empire of his heart. There lived close at hand ahard-working country lass Aldonza Lorenzo on whom sometimes he hadcast an eye but who was quite unmindful of the gentleman. Her heselected for his peerless lady and dubbed her with the sweet-soundingname of Dulcinea del Toboso._II.--An Adventure in a Courtyard_One morning in the hottest part of July with great secrecy he armedhimself mounted Rozinante and rode out of his backyard into the openfields. He was disturbed to think that the honour of knighthood had notyet been conferred upon him but determined to rectify this matter at anearly opportunity and rode on soliloquising after the manner ofknight-errants as happy as a man might be.Towards evening he arrived at a common inn before whose door sat twowenches the companions of some carriers bound for Seville. Don Quixoteinstantly imagined the inn to be a castle and the wenches to be fairladies taking the air and as a swine-herd getting his hogs together ina stubble-field near at hand chanced at that moment to wind his hornour gentleman imagined that this was a signal of his approach and rodeforward in the highest spirits.The extravagant language in which he addressed them astonished thewenches as much as his amazing appearance and they first would have runfrom him but finally stayed to laugh. Don Quixote rebuked them whereatthey laughed the more and only the innkeeper's appearance prevented theknight's indignation from carrying him to extremities. This man was forpeace and welcomed the strange apparition to his inn with all civilitymarvelling much to find himself addressed as Sir Castellan. So theknight sat down to supper with strange company and discoursed ofchivalry to the bewilderment of all present treating the inn as acastle the host as a noble gentleman and the wenches as great ladies.He presently sought the innkeeper alone in the stable and kneelingrequested to be dubbed a knight vowing that he would not move from thatplace till 'twas done. The host guessed the distraction of his visitorand complied counselling Don Quixote--who had never read of such things
comment312,in books of chivalry--to provide himself henceforth with money and cleanshirts and no longer to ride penniless. That night Don Quixote watchedhis arms by moonlight laying them upon the horse-trough in the yard ofthe inn while from a distance the innkeeper and his guests watched thegaunt man now leaning on his lance and now walking to and fro withhis target on his arm.It chanced that a carrier came to water his mules and was about toremove the armour when Don Quixote in a loud voice called him todesist. The man took no notice and Don Quixote calling upon hisDulcinea to assist him lifted his lance and brought it down on thecarrier's pate laying him flat. A second carrier came and was treatedin like manner but now all the company of them came and with showersof stones made a terrible assault upon the knight. It was only theinterference of the innkeeper that put an end to this battle and bycareful words he was able to appease Don Quixote's wrath and get him outof the inn.On his way the now happy knight found a farmer beating a boy andbidding him desist inquired the reason of this chastisement. The manafraid of the strange armoured figure told how this boy did his workbadly in the field and deserved his flogging but the boy declared thatthe farmer owed him wages and that whenever he asked for them hismaster flogged him. Sternly did the Don command the man to pay the lad'swages and when the fellow promised to do so directly he got home andthe boy protested that he would surely never keep that promise DonQuixote threatened the farmer saying "I am the valorous Don Quixote ofLa Mancha righter of wrongs revenger and redresser of grievancesremember what you have promised and sworn as you will answer thecontrary at your peril." Convinced that the man dare not disobey herode forward and the farmer very soon continued his flogging of theboy.A company of merchants approaching caused Don Quixote to halt in themiddle of the road calling upon them to stand until they acknowledgedDulcinea del Toboso to be the peerless beauty of the world. Thischallenge was met with prevarication which enraged Don Quixote andclapping spurs to Rozinante he bore down upon the company with his lancecouched.A stumble of the horse threw him and as he lay on the ground unable tomove one of the servants of the company came up and broke the lanceacross Don Quixote's ribs. It was not until a countryman came by thatthe Don was extricated and then he had to ride back to his own villageon the ass of the poor labourer being so stiff and sore as quiteincapable to mount Rozinante.The curate and the barber seeing now what havoc romances of chivalrywere making in the wits of this good gentleman ran through his librarywhile he lay wounded in bed burned all his noxious works and securelylocking the door prepared the tale that enchantment had carried awaythe books and the very chamber itself.None of the entreaties of his niece nor the remonstrances of hishousekeeper could stay Don Quixote at home and he soon prepared for asecond sally. He persuaded a good honest country labourer Sancho Panzaby name to enter his service as squire promising him for reward thefirst island or empire which his lance should happen to conquer. Thusdid things happen in books of chivalry and he did not doubt that thusit would happen with him._III.--The Immortal Partnership_So it came to pass that one night Don Quixote stole away from his home
comment313,and Sancho Panza from his wife and children and with the master onRozinante the servant on his ass Dapple hastened away under cover ofdarkness in search of adventures. As they travelled "I beseech yourworship" quoth Sancho "be sure you forget not your promise of theisland for I dare swear I shall make shift to govern it let it benever so big." The knight in a rhapsody foreshadowed the day whenSancho might be made even a king for in romances of chivalry there isno limit to the gifts made by valorous knights to their faithfulsquires. But Sancho shook his head. "Though it rain kingdoms on the faceof the earth not one of them would fit well upon the head of my wifefor I must needs tell you she is not worth two brass-jacks to make aqueen of."As they were thus discoursing they espied some thirty windmills in theplain which Don Quixote instantly took for giants. Nothing that Sanchosaid could dissuade him and he must needs clap spurs to his horse andride a-tilt at these great windmills recommending himself to his ladyDulcinea. As he ran his lance into the sail of the first mill the windwhirled about with such swiftness that the motion broke the lance intoshivers and hurled away both knight and horse along with it. WhenSancho came upon his master the Don explained that some cursednecromancer had converted those giants into windmills to deprive him ofthe honour of victory.When the knight was recovered they continued their way and their nextadventure was to meet two monks on mules riding before a coach withfour or five men on horseback wherein sat a lady going to Seville tomeet her husband. Don Quixote rode forward addressed the monks as"cursed implements of hell" and bade them instantly release the lovelyprincess in the coach. The monks flew for their lives as Don Quixotecharged down upon them but Sancho was thrown down by the servants whotore his beard trampled his stomach beat and mauled him in every partof his body and then left him sprawling without breath or motion.As for Don Quixote he came off victor in this conflict and onlydesisted from slaying his assailant on the plea of the lady in thecoach and on her promise that the conquered man should present himselfbefore the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso. The recovered Sancho wassurprised to find that his master had no island to bestow upon him afterthis incredible victory wherein he himself had suffered sodisastrously.In a fierce encounter with some Yanguesian carriers Don Quixote waswounded almost to death and he explained to Sancho that his defeat heowed to fighting with common people bidding Sancho in future to fighthimself against such common fellows."Sir" said Sancho "I am a peaceful man a quiet fellow do you see Ican make shift to forgive injuries as well as any man as having a wifeto maintain and children to bring up. I freely forgive all mankindhigh and low lords and beggars whatsoever wrongs they ever did or maydo me without the least exception."At the next inn they came upon Don Quixote who was lying prone onSancho's ass groaning in pain vowed that here was a worthy castle.
comment314,Sancho swore 'twas an inn. Their dispute lasted till they reached thedoor where Sancho marched straight in without troubling himself anyfurther in the matter. It was here that surprising adventures tookplace. The knight Sancho and a carrier were obliged to share onechamber. The maid of the inn entering this apartment was mistaken byDon Quixote for the princess of the castle and taking her in his armshe poured out a rhapsody to the virtues of Dulcinea del Toboso. Thecarrier resented this and in a moment the place was in an uproar. Sucha fight never took place before and when it was over both the knightand the squire were as near dead as men can be. To right himself DonQuixote concocted a balsam of which he had read and drinking it offpresently was so grievously ill that he was like to cast up his heart andliver.Being got to bed again he felt sure that he was now invulnerable andhe woke early next day eager to sally forth. When the host asked forhis reckoning "How Is this an inn" quoth the Don. "Yes and one ofthe best on the road." "How strangely have I been mistaken then Upon myhonour I took it for a castle and a considerable one too." Sayingwhich he added that knights never yet paid for the honour theyconferred in lying at any man's house and so rode away. But poor SanchoPanza did not get off scot free for they tossed him in a blanket in thebackyard where the Don could see the torture over the wall but couldby no means get to the rescue of his squire.When they were together again the gallant Don comforted poor SanchoPanza with hopes of an island and explained away all their sufferingson the grounds of necromancy. All that had gone awry with them was thework of some cursed enchanters.Their next adventure was begun by a cloud of dust on the horizon whichinstantly made Don Quixote exclaim that a great battle was in progress.A nearer view revealed that the dust rose from a huge flock of sheepbut the knight's blood was up and he rode forward as fast as poorRozinante could carry him and did frightful slaughter among the sheeptill the stones of the shepherd brought him to the earth. "Lord saveus" cried Sancho as he assisted the Don to his feet. "Your worship hasleft on his lower side only two grinders and on the upper not one."Later they came upon a company of priests with lighted taperscarrying a corpse through the night. Don Quixote charged them broughtone of the company to the ground and scattered the rest. Sancho Panzawhose stomach cried cupboard filled his wallet with the rich provisionsof the priests boasting to the wounded man that his master was theredoubtable Don Quixote of La Mancha otherwise called the Knight of theRueful Countenance. When the adventure was over Don Quixote questionedhis squire on this name and Sancho replied "I have been staring uponyou this pretty while by the light of that unlucky priest's torch andmay I never stir if ever I set eyes on a more dismal countenance in myborn days."The next enterprise was with a barber who carried his new brass basinon his head so that it suggested to Don Quixote the famous helmet ofMambrino. Accordingly he bore down upon the barber put him to flightand possessed himself of the basin which he wore as a helmet. Moreserious was the following adventure when Don Quixote released from the
comment315,king's officers a gang of galley slaves because they assured him thatthey travelled chained much against their will. So gallantly did theknight behave that he conquered the officers and left them all butdead. Nevertheless coming to an argument with the released convictswhom he would have sent to his lady Dulcinea he himself and Sanchotoo were as mauled by the convicts as even those self-same officers.It now came to Don Quixote that he must perform a penance in themountains and sending Sancho with a letter to Dulcinea he divestedhimself of much of his armour and underwear and performed the maddestgambols and self-tortures ever witnessed under a blue sky.However it chanced that Sancho Panza soon fell in with the curate andthe barber of Don Quixote's village and these good friends by acunning subterfuge in which a beautiful young lady played a part gotDon Quixote safely home and into his own bed. The lady affecting greatdistress made Don Quixote vow to enter upon no adventure until he hadrighted a wrong done against herself and one night as they journeyedon this mission a great cage was made and placed over Don Quixote as heslept and thus persuaded that necromancy was at work against him thevaliant knight was borne back a prisoner to his home._IV.--Sancho Governs His Island_Nothing short of a prison cell could keep Don Quixote from his salliesand soon he was on the road again accompanied by his faithful squire.To Sancho who believed his master mad and whose chief aim in life wasfilling his own stomach these adventures of the Don had but one endthe governorship of the promised island. While he thought the knightmad he believed in him and while he was selfish he loved his masteras the tale tells.It chanced that one day they came upon a frolicsome duke and duchess whohad heard of their adventures and who instantly set themselves to enjoyso rare a sport as that offered by the entertainment of the knight andhis squire. The Don was invited to the duke's castle as a mighty heroand there treated with all possible honour but some tricks were playedupon him which were certainly unworthy of the duke's courtesy.Nevertheless this visit had the happiest culmination since it was fromthe hands of the duke that Sancho at last received his governorship.Making pretence that a certain town on his estate named Barataria wasan island the duke dispatched Sancho to govern it and after anaffecting farewell with his master who gave him the wisest possibleadvice on the subject of statecraft Sancho set out in a glitteringcavalcade to take up his governorship with his beloved Dapple ledbehind.After a magnificent entry into the city Sancho Panza was called upon togive judgment in certain teasing disputes and this he did with such witand such wholesome commonsense that he delighted all who heard him.
comment316,Well-pleased with himself he sat down in a grand hall to a solitarybanquet with a physician standing by his side. No sooner had Sanchotasted a dish than the physician touched it with a wand and a page boreit swiftly away. At first Sancho was confounded by this interferencewith his appetite but presently he grew bold and expostulatedwhereupon the physician said that his mission was to overlook thegovernor's health and to see that he ate nothing which was prejudicialto his physical well-being since the happiness of the state dependedupon the health of its governor. Sancho bore it for some time but atlength starting up he bade the physician avaunt saying "By the sun'slight I'll get me a good cudgel and beginning with your carcase willso belabour all the physic-mongers in the island that I will not leaveone of the tribe. Let me eat or let them take their government againfor an office that will not afford a man his victuals is not worth twohorse beans."At that moment there came a messenger from the duke sweating and withconcern in his looks who pulled a packet from his bosom and presentedit to the governor. This message from the duke was to warn Sancho that afurious enemy intended to attack his island and that he must be on hisguard. "I have also the intelligence" wrote the duke "from faithfulspies that there are four men got into the town in disguise to murderyou your abilities being regarded as a great obstacle to the enemy'sdesign. Take heed how you admit strangers to speak with you and eatnothing that is laid before you."Sancho set out to inspect his defences but with every step he took hewas confronted by some problem of government on which he was called uponto adjudicate. Harassed by these appeals and half famished ourgovernor began to think that governorship was the sorriest trade onearth and before a week was over he addressed to Don Quixote a letterconcluding "Heaven preserve you from ill-minded enchanters and send mesafe and sound out of this government." One night he was awakened by theclanging of a great bell and in came servants crying in affright thatthe enemy was approaching. Sancho rose and was adjured by his subjectsto lead them forth against their terrible foes. He asked for food anddeclared that he knew nothing of arms. They rebuked him and bringinghim shields and a lance proceeded to tie him up so tightly with shieldsbehind and shields before that he could scarcely move. Then they badehim march and lead on the army. "March" quoth he. "These bonds stickso plaguey close that I cannot so much as bend my knees" "For shame"they answered. "It is fear and not armour that stiffens your legs." Thusrebuked Sancho endeavoured to move but fell flat on the earth like agreat tortoise while in the darkness the others made a clash with theirswords and shields and trampled upon the prone governor who quite gavehimself up for dead. But at break of day they raised a cry of "Victory"and lifting Sancho up told him that their enemies were driven off.To this he said nothing save to ask for his old clothes. And when he wasdressed he went down to Dapple's stall and embraced his faithful asswith tears in his eyes. "Come hither my friend and true companion"quoth he "happy were my days my months and years when with thee Ijourneyed and all my concern was to mend thy harness and find food forthy little stomach But now that I have climbed to the towers of
comment317,ambition a thousand woes a thousand torments and four thousandtribulations have haunted my soul" While he spoke he fitted on thepack-saddle mounted his ass bade farewell to the people and departedin peace and great humility._V.--The Death of Don Quixote_Meanwhile Don Quixote had been fooled to the top of his bent in theduke's castle and had endured tribulations from maids and mensufficient to deject the finest fortitude. He was now in the mood toforsake that great castle and to embrace once more the life of the openroad and so with Sancho Panza he started out to take up the threads ofhis old life. After adventures so miraculous as to seem incredible DonQuixote was laid low in an encounter with a friend of his disguised as aknight and by this defeat was so broken and humiliated that he thoughtto turn shepherd and to spend the remainder of his days in a pastorallife. Sancho cheered him and kept his heart as high as it would reachin his misery and together they turned their faces towards homeleaving the future to the disposition of Providence.As they entered the village two boys fighting in a field attracted theknight's attention and he heard one of them cry "Never fret yourselfyou shall never see her while you have breath in your body" The knightimmediately applied these words to himself and Dulcinea and nothingthat Sancho could say had power to cheer his spirits. Moreover the boysof the village having seen them raised a shout and came laughingabout them saying "Oh law here is Gaffer Sancho Panza's donkey asfine as a lady and Don Quixote's beast thinner than ever" The barberand the curate then came upon the scene and saw their old friend andwent with him to his house.Here Don Quixote faithfully described his discomfiture in the encounterwith another knight and declared his intention honourably to observethe conditions laid upon him of being confined to his village for ayear.Melancholy increased with the poor knight and he was seized with aviolent fever. The physician and his friends conjectured that hissickness arose from regret for his defeat and disappointment ofDulcinea's disenchantment they did all they could do to divert him butin vain. One day he desired them to leave him and for six hours heslept so profoundly that his niece thought he was dead. At the end ofthis time he wakened and cried with a loud voice "Blessed be AlmightyGod for this great benefit He has vouchsafed to me His mercies areinfinite greater are they than the sins of men."These rational words surprised his niece and she asked what he meant bythem. He answered that by God's mercy his judgment had returned freeand clear. "The cloud of ignorance" said he "is now removed whichcontinuous reading of those noxious books of knight-errantry had laidupon me." He said that his great grief now was the lateness with whichenlightenment had come leaving him so little time to prepare his soulfor death.The others coming in Don Quixote made his confession and one went tofetch Sancho Panza. With tears in his eyes the squire sought his poormaster's side and when in the first clause of his will Don Quixote made
comment318,mention of Sancho saying afterwards "Pardon me my friend that Ibrought upon you the shame of my madness" Sancho cried out "Woe's meyour worship do not die this bout take my counsel and live many agood year. For it is the maddest trick a man can play in his whole lifeto go out like the snuff of a candle and die merely of the mulligrubs"The others admonished him in like spirit but Don Quixote answered andsaid "Gently sirs do not look in last year's nests for the birds ofthis year. I was mad but now I have my reason. I was Don Quixote of LaMancha but to-day I am Alonso Quixano the Good. I hope that myrepentance and my sincerity will restore me to the esteem that once youhad for me. And now let Master Notary proceed." So he finished writinghis will and then fell into a swooning fit and lay full length in hisbed. But he lingered some days and when he did give up the ghost or tospeak more plainly when he died it was amidst the tears andlamentations of his family and after he had received the lastsacrament and had expressed in pathetic way his horror at the booksof chivalry.                                   ADALBERT VON CHAMISSOPeter Schlemihl the Shadowless Man      Adalbert von Chamisso a German lyric poet and scientist was     born on January 30 1781 at the Castle of Boncourt in the     Champagne district of France. His parents emigrated in 1790     and in 1796 he became page to the Queen of Prussia. Two years     afterwards he entered the army which he left in 1806 to go to     France returning to Berlin in the following year. In 1810 he     proceeded to France once more and thence to Geneva where he     began his study of natural history. In 1815 he went with Otto     von Kotzehue on a tour round the world and on his return he     settled in Berlin having obtained a post in the Botanical     Gardens. He wrote several important books on botany     topography and ethnology but became even more famous through     his poems ballads and romances. "Peter Schlemihl" which was     written in 1813 was published in the following year by     Chamisso's friend Fouqu and achieved so great a success that     it was translated into most languages. Chamisso died in Berlin     on August 21 1838._I.--The Grey Man_Having safely landed after a fatiguing journey I took my modestbelongings to the nearest cheap inn engaged a garret room washed puton my newly-turned black coat and proceeded to find Mr. Thomas John'smansion. After a severe cross-examination on the part of thehall-porter I had the honour of being shown into the park where Mr.John was entertaining a party. He graciously took my letter ofintroduction continuing the while to talk to his guests. Then he brokethe seal still joining in the conversation which turned upon wealth."Anyone" he remarked "who has not at least a million is pardon theword a rogue." "How true" I exclaimed which pleased him for he askedme to stay. Then offering his arm to a fair lady he led the party tothe rose-clad hill. Everybody was very jolly and I followed behind soas not to make myself a nuisance.The beautiful Fanny who seemed to be the queen of the day in trying topick a rose had scratched her finger which caused much commotion. Sheasked for some plaster and a quiet lean tall elderly man dressed ingrey who walked by my side put his hand in his coat pocket pulled outa pocket-book and with a deep bow handed the lady what she wanted.She took it without thanks and we all continued to ascend the hill.Arrived at the top Mr. John espying a light spot on the horizoncalled for a telescope. Before the servants had time to move the greyman bowing modestly had put his hand in his pocket and pulled out abeautiful telescope which passed from hand to hand without beingreturned to its owner. Nobody seemed surprised at the huge instrument
comment319,issuing from a tiny pocket and nobody took any more notice of the greyman than of myself.The ground was damp and somebody suggested how fine it would be tospread some Turkey carpets. Scarcely had the wish been expressed whenthe grey man again put his hand into his pocket and with a modesthumble gesture pulled out a rich Turkey carpet some twenty yards byten which was spread out by the servants without anybody appearing tobe surprised. I asked a young gentleman who the obliging man might be.He did not know.The sun began to get troublesome and Fanny casually asked the grey manif he might happen to have a tent by him. He bowed deeply and began topull out of his pocket canvas and bars and ropes and everythingneeded for the tent which was promptly put up. Again nobody seemedsurprised. I felt uncanny especially when at the next expresseddesire I saw him pull out of his pocket three fine large horses withsaddles and trappings You would not believe it if I did not tell youthat I saw it with my own eyes.It was gruesome. I sneaked away and had already reached the foot of thehill when to my horror I noticed the grey man approaching. He tookoff his hat bowed humbly and addressed me."Forgive my impertinence sir but during the short time I have had thehappiness to be near you I have been able to look with indescribableadmiration upon that beautiful shadow of yours which you throw from youcontemptuously as it were. Pardon me but would you feel inclined tosell it"I thought he was mad. "Is your own shadow not enough for you What astrange bargain""No price is too high for this invaluable shadow. I have many a preciousthing in my pocket which you may choose--a mandrake the dish-cloth ofRoland's page Fortunati's purse----""What Fortunati's purse""Will you condescend to try it" he said handing me a money-bag ofmoderate size from which I drew ten gold pieces and another ten andyet another ten.I extended my hand and exclaimed "A bargain For this purse you canhave my shadow." He seized my hand knelt down cleverly detached myshadow from the lawn rolled it up folded it and put it in his pocket.Then he bowed and retired behind the rose-hedge chuckling gently.I hurried back to my inn after having tied the bag around my neckunder my waistcoat. As I went along the sunny street I heard an oldwoman's voice "Heigh young man you have lost your shadow""Thank you" I said threw her a gold piece and sought the shade of thetrees. But I had to cross a broad street again just as a group of boyswere leaving school. They shouted at me jeered and threw mud at me. Tokeep them away I threw a handful of gold among them and jumped into acarriage. Now I began to feel what I had sacrificed. What was to becomeof meAt the inn I sent for my things and then made the driver take me to thebest hotel where I engaged the state rooms and locked myself up. Andwhat my dear Chamisso do you think I did then I pulled masses of goldout of the bag covered the floor of the room with ducats threw myself
comment320,upon them made them tinkle rolled over them buried my hands in themuntil I was exhausted and fell to sleep. Next morning I had to cart allthese coins into a cupboard leaving only just a few handfuls. Thenwith the help of the host I engaged some servants a certain Bendel agood faithful soul being specially recommended to me as a valet. Ispent the whole day with tailors bootmakers jewellers merchants andbought a heap of precious things just to get rid of the heaps of gold.I never ventured out in daytime and even at night when I happened tostep out into the moonlight I had to suffer untold anguish from thecontemptuous sneers of men the deep pity of women the shuddering fearof fair maidens. Then I sent Bendel to search for the grey man givinghim every possible indication. He came back late and told me that noneof Mr. John's servants or guests remembered the stranger and that hecould find no trace of him. "By the way" he concluded "a gentlemanwhom I met just as I went out bid me tell you that he was on the pointof leaving the country and that in a year and a day he would call onyou to propose new business. He said you would know who he was.""How did he look" Bendel described the man in the grey coat He was indespair when I told him that this was the very person I wanted. But itwas too late he had gone without leaving a trace.A famous artist for whom I sent to ask him whether he could paint me ashadow told me that he might but I should be bound to lose it again atthe slightest movement."How did you manage to lose yours" he asked. I had to lie. "When I wastravelling in Russia it froze so firmly to the ground that I could notget it off again.""The best thing you can do is not to walk in the sun" the artistretorted with a piercing look and walked out.I confessed my misfortune to Bendel and the sympathetic lad after aterrible struggle with his conscience decided to remain in my service.From that day he was always with me ever trying to throw his broadshadow over me to conceal my affliction from the world. Neverthelessthe fair Fanny whom I often met in the hours of dusk and evening andwho had begun to show me marked favour discovered my terrible secretone night as the moon suddenly rose from behind a cloud and faintedwith terror.There was nothing left for me but to leave the town. I sent for horsestook only Bendel and another servant a rogue named Gauner with me andcovered thirty miles during the night. Then we continued our journeyacross the mountains to a little-frequented watering-place where I wasanxious to seek rest from my troubles._II.--A Soul for a Shadow_Bendel preceded me to prepare a house for my reception and spent moneyso lavishly that the rumour spread the King of Prussia was comingincognito. A grand reception was prepared by the townsfolk with musicand flowers and a chorus of maidens in white led by a girl of wonderfulbeauty. And all this in broad sunlight I did not move in my carriageand Bendel tried to explain that there must be a mistake which made thegood folk believe that I wanted to remain incognito. Bendel handed adiamond tiara to the beautiful maiden and we drove on amid cheering andfiring of guns.I became known as Count Peter and when it was found out that the Kingof Prussia was elsewhere they all thought I must be some other king. Igave a grand fete Bendel taking good care to have such lavishilluminations all round that no one should notice the absence of my
comment321,shadow. I had masses of gold coins thrown among the people in thestreet and gave Mina the beautiful girl who headed the chorus at myarrival all the jewels I had brought with me for distribution amongher friends. She was the daughter of the verdurer and I lost no time inmaking friends with her parents and succeeded in gaining Mina'saffection.Continuing to spend money with regal lavishness I myself led a simpleand retired life never leaving my rooms in daylight. Bendel warned meof Gauner's extensive thefts but I did not mind. Why should I grudgehim the money of which I had an inexhaustible store In the evenings Iused to meet Mina in her garden and always found her loving thoughawed by my wealth and supposed rank. Yet conscious of my dreadfulsecret I dared not ask for her hand. But the year was nearly up since Ihad made the fateful bargain and I looked forward to the promised visitof the grey man whom I hoped to persuade to take back his bag for myshadow. In fact I told the verdurer that on the first of the next monthI should ask him for his daughter's hand.The anniversary arrived--midday evening midnight. I waited through thelong hours heard the clock strike twelve but the grey man did notcome Towards morning I fell into a fitful slumber. I was awakened byangry voices. Gauner forced his way into my room which was defended bythe faithful Bendel."What do you want you rogue""Only to see your shadow with your lordship's permission.""How dare you----""I am not going to serve a man without a shadow. Either you show it tome or I go."I wanted to offer him money but he who had stolen millions refused toaccept money from a man without a shadow. He put on his hat and leftthe room whistling.When at dark I went with a heavy heart to Mina's bower I found herpale and beautiful and her father with a letter in his hand. He lookedat the letter then scrutinised me and said "Do you happen to know mylord a certain Peter Schlemihl who lost his shadow""Oh my foreboding" cried Mina. "I knew it he has no shadow""And you dared" continued the verdurer "to deceive us See how shesobs Confess now how you lost your shadow."Again I was forced to lie. "Some time ago a man stepped so clumsily intomy shadow that he made a big hole. I sent it to be mended and waspromised to have it back yesterday.""Very well. Either you present yourself within three days with awell-fitting shadow or on the next day my daughter will be anotherman's wife."I rushed away half conscious groaning and raving. I do not know how
comment322,long and how far I ran but I found myself on a sunny heath whensomebody suddenly pulled my sleeve. I turned round. It was the man inthe grey coat"I announced my visit for to-day. You made a mistake in your impatience.All is well. You buy your shadow back and you will be welcomed by yourbride. As for Gauner who has betrayed you and has asked for Mina'shand--he is ripe for me."I groped for the bag but the stranger stopped me."No my lord you keep this I only want a little souvenir. Be goodenough and sign this scrap." On the parchment was written "I herewithassign to bearer my soul after its natural separation from my body."I sternly refused. "I am not inclined to stake my soul for my shadow."He continued to urge giving the most plausible reasons why I shouldsign. But I was firm. He even tried to tempt me by unrolling my shadowon the heath. "A line of your pen and you save your Mina from thatrogue's clutches."At that moment Bendel arrived on the scene saw me in tears my shadowon the ground apparently in the stranger's power and set upon the manwith his stick. The grey man walked away and Bendel followed himraining blows upon his shoulders till they disappeared from sight.I was left with my despair and spent the day and night on the heath. Iwas resolved not to return among men and wandered about for three daysfeeding on wild fruit and spring-water. On the morning of the fourth dayI suddenly heard a sound but could see nobody--only a shadow notunlike my own but without body. I determined to seize it and rushedafter it. Gradually I gained on it with a final rush I made for it--andmet unexpectedly bodily resistance. We fell on the ground and a manbecame visible under me. I understood at once. The man must have had theinvisible bird's nest which he dropped in the struggle thus becomingvisible himself.The nest being invisible I looked for its shadow found it seized itquickly and of course disappeared from the man's sight. I left himtearing his hair in despair and I rejoiced at being able to go againamong men. Quickly I proceeded to Mina's garden which was still emptyalthough I imagined I heard steps following me. I sat down on a benchand watched the verdurer leaving the house. Then a fog seemed to passover my head. I looked around and--oh horror--beheld the grey mansitting by my side. He had pulled his magic cap over my head at hisfeet was his shadow and my own and his hand played with the parchment."So we are both under the same cap" he began "now please give me backmy bird's nest. Thanks You see sometimes we are forced to do what werefuse when asked kindly. I think you had better buy that shadow back.I'll throw in the magic cap."Meanwhile Mina's mother had joined the verdurer and they began todiscuss Mina's approaching marriage and Gauner's wealth which amountedto ten millions. Then Mina joined them. She was urged to consent andfinally said sobbingly "I have no further wish on earth. Do with me asyou please." At this moment Gauner approached and Mina fainted."Can you endure this" asked my companion. "Have you no blood in yourveins" He rapidly scratched a slight wound in my hand and dipped a penin the blood. "To be sure red blood Then sign." And I took the pen andparchment.I had scarcely touched food for days and the excitement of this lasthour had completely exhausted my strength. Before I had time to sign Iswooned away. When I awoke it was dark. My hateful companion was in atowering rage. The sound of festive music came from the brightlyilluminated house groups of people strolled through the garden talkingof Mina's marriage with the wealthy Mr. Gauner which had taken placethis morning.Disengaging myself from the magic cap which act made my companiondisappear from my view I made for the garden gate. But the invisiblewretch followed me with his taunts. He only left me at the door of myhouse with a mocking "_au revoir_." The place had been wrecked by themob and was deserted. Only the faithful Bendel was there to receive mewith tears of mingled grief and joy. I pressed him to my heart and bidhim leave me to my misery. I told him to keep a few boxes filled with
comment323,gold that were still in the house made him saddle my horse anddeparted leaving the choice of the road to the animal for I hadneither aim nor wish nor hope.A pedestrian joined me on the sad journey. After tramping along for awhile he asked permission to put his cloak on my horse. I consented hethanked me and then in a kind of soliloquy began to praise the powerof wealth and to speak cleverly of metaphysics. Meanwhile day wasdawning the sun was about to rise the shadows to spread theirsplendour--and I was not alone I looked at my companion--it was the manwith the grey coatHe smiled at my surprise and continued to converse amiably. In fact henot only offered to replace for the time being my former servant Bendelbut actually lent me my shadow for the journey. The temptation wasgreat. I suddenly gave my horse the spurs and galloped off at fullspeed but alas my shadow remained behind and I had to turn backshamefacedly."You can't escape me" said my companion "I hold you by your shadow."And all the time hour by hour day by day he continued his urging. Atlast we quarrelled seriously and he decided to leave me. "If ever youwant me you have only to shake your bag. You hold me by my gold. Youknow I can be useful especially to the wealthy you have seen it."I thought of the past and asked him quickly "Did you get Mr. John'ssignature" He smiled. "With so good a friend the formality was notnecessary.""Where is he I want to know."He hesitated then put his hand into his pocket and pulled out Mr.John's livid body the blue lips of the corpse moved and utteredpainfully the words "_Justo judico Dei judicatus sum justo judicio Deicondemnatus sum."_Seized with horror I threw the inexhaustible money-bag into the abyssand then spoke the final words. "You fiend I exorcise you in the nameof God Be off and never show yourself before mine eyes again"He glared at me furiously and disappeared instantly._III.--The Wanderer_Left now without shadow and without money save for the few gold piecesstill in my pocket I could almost have been happy had it not been forthe loss of my love. My horse was down below at the inn I decided toleave it there and to wander on on foot. In the forest I encountered apeasant from whom I obtained information about the district and itsinhabitants. He was an intelligent man and I quite enjoyed the talk.When we approached the wide bed of a mountain stream I made him walk infront but he turned round to speak to me. Suddenly he broke off--"Buthow is that You have no shadow""Unfortunately" I said with a sigh. "During an illness I lost my hairnails and shadow. The hair and nails have grown again but the shadowwon't.""That must have been a bad illness" said the peasant and walked on insilence till we reached the nearest side-road when he turned offwithout saying another word. I wept bitter tears and my good spiritshad vanished. And so I wandered on sadly avoiding all villages tillnightfall and often waiting for hours to pass a sunny patch unobserved.I wanted to find work in a mine to save me from my thoughts.My boots began to be worn out. My slender means made me decide to buy astrong pair that had already been used new ones were too dear. I putthem on at once and walked out of the village scarcely noticing theway since I was thinking deeply of the mine I hoped to reach the samenight and of the manner in which I was to obtain employment. I hadscarcely walked two hundred steps when I noticed that I had lost theroad. I was in a wild virginal forest. Another few steps and I was on anendless ice-field. The cold was unbearable and I had to hasten mysteps. I ran for a few minutes and found myself in rice-fields whereChinese labourers were working. There could be no doubt I had seven-league boots on my feetI fell on my knees shedding tears of gratitude. Now my future wasclear. Excluded from society study and science were to be my futurestrength and hope. I wandered through the whole world from east to west
comment324,from north to south comparing the fauna and flora of the differentregions. To reduce the speed of my progress I found I had only to pulla pair of slippers over my boots. When I wanted money I just took anivory tusk to sell in London. And finally I made a home in the ancientcaves of the desert near Thebes.Once in the far north I encountered a polar bear. Throwing off myslippers I wanted to step upon an island facing me. I firmly placed myfoot on it but on the other side I fell into the sea as the slipperhad not come off my boot. I saved my life and hurried to the Libyandesert to cure my cold in the sun but the heat made me ill. I lostconsciousness and when I awoke again I was in a comfortable bed amongother beds and on the wall facing me I saw inscribed in golden lettersmy own name.To cut things short--the institution which had received me had beenfounded by Bendel and the widowed Mina with my money and in my honourhad been called the Schlemihlium. As soon as I felt strong enough Ireturned to my desert cave and thus I live to this day.You my dear Chamisso are to be the keeper of my strange history whichmay contain useful advice for many. You if you will live among menhonour first the shadow then the money. But if you live only for yourbetter self you will need no advice.                                   CHATEAUBRIANDAtala      Francois Ren Vicomte de Chateaubriand born on September 4     1768 at St. Malo Brittany was as distinguished for his     extraordinary and romantic career as for the versatility of     his genius. At the height of the Revolution 1791 he left for     America with the intention of discovering the North-West     passage but in two years returned to fight on the royalist     side and was wounded at the siege of Thionville. Emigrating     to England he remained in London for eight years supporting     himself with difficulty by translating and teaching and     writing. Returning to France Chateaubriand was appointed by     Napoleon secretary to the embassy in Rome but the execution     of the Duke d'Enghien so repelled him that he resigned and set     out on a long Oriental journey. Living in privacy till the     fall of Napoleon he then returned to his native land and     from 1822 to 1824 was ambassador to the British Court. His     whole political career was eccentric and uncertain and he     himself declared that he was by heredity and honour a     Bourbonist by conviction a Monarchist but by temperament a     Republican. He died on July 4 1848. "Atala" which appeared     in 1801 formed the first part of a prose epic "The Natchez"     on the wild and picturesque life of the Red Indians the idea     for which Chateaubriand had conceived while wandering about     America. It at once raised its author to the highest position     in the French literary world of the age of Napoleon. In 1802     Chateaubriand published a work of still greater importance--at     least from a social point of view--"The Genius of     Christianity"--which magnificent and gorgeous piece of     rhetoric produced a profound change in the general attitude of     Frenchmen in regard to religion undid to some extent the     destructive work of Voltaire and was instrumental in inducing     Napoleon to come to terms with the Pope. But it is on "Atala"     that Chateaubriand's title to be one of the greatest masters     of French prose literature depends._I.--The Song of Death_"It is surely a singular fate" said the old blind Red Indian chief tothe young Frenchman "which has brought us together from the ends of theearth. I see in you a civilised man who for some strange reasonwishes to become a savage. You see in me a savage who also for somestrange reason has tried to become a civilised man. Though we haveentered on life from two opposite points here we are sitting side byside. And I a childless man have sworn to be a father to you and you
comment325,a fatherless boy have sworn to be a son to me."Chactas the chief of the Natchez and Ren the Frenchman whom he hadadopted into his tribe were sitting at the prow of a pirogue whichwith its sail of sewn skins outstretched to the night wind was glidingdown the moonlit waters of the Ohio amid the magnificent desert ofKentucky. Behind them was a fleet of pirogues which Ren was pilotingon a hunting foray. Seeing that all the Indians were sleeping Chactaswent on talking to his adopted son."How little even now we know of each other Ren. You never told mewhat it was that made you leave France in 1725 and come to Louisianaand ask to be admitted to our tribe. I have never told you why I havenot married and got children to succeed me and help me in my old age togovern my people."It is now seventy-three years since my mother brought me into the worldon the banks of the Mississippi. In 1652 there were a few Spaniardssettled in the bay of Pensacola but no white man was then seen inLouisiana. I was scarcely seventeen years old when I fought with myfather the famous warrior Outalissi against the Creeks of Florida. Wewere then allied with the Spaniards but in spite of the help they gaveus we were defeated. My father was killed and I was grievouslywounded. Oh why did I then not descend into the land of the dead Happyindeed should I have been had I thus escaped from the fate which waswaiting for me on earth"But one of our allies an old Castilian named Lopez moved by my youthand simplicity rescued me in the battle and led me to the town of St.Augustin which his countrymen had recently built. My benefactor took meto his home and he and his sister adopted me as their son and tried toteach me their knowledge and religion. But after passing thirteen monthsat St. Augustin I was seized with a disgust for town life. The cityseemed to me a prison and I longed to get back to the wild life of myfathers. At last I resolved to return to my tribe and one morning Icame to Lopez clad in the dress of the Natchez with bow and arrows inone hand and a tomahawk in the other."'Oh my father' I said to him my face streaming with tears 'I shalldie if I stay in this city. I am an Indian and I must live like anIndian.'"Lopez tried to detain me by pointing out the peril I was running. But Ialready knew that in order to join the Natchez I should have to passthrough the country of the Creeks and might fall into the hands of ourold enemies and this did not deter me. At last Lopez seeing howresolute I was said 'Go my boy and God be with you Were I onlyyounger I too would return with you to the wilderness where thehappiest part of my life was spent. But when you get back to the forest
comment326,think sometimes of the old Spaniard of St. Augustin and if ever a whiteman falls into your hands treat him my son as I have treated you.'"It was not long Ren before I was punished for my ingratitude inrunning away from my protector. I had forgotten in the city my knowledgeof wood-craft and I lost my way in the great forest and was capturedby a band of Creeks. My costume and the feathers in my hair proclaimedme one of the Natchez and when Simaghan the chief of the band boundme and demanded who I was I proudly answered. 'I am Chactas the sonof the Outalissi who took more than a hundred scalps from the warriorsof the Creeks.'"'Chactas son of Outalissi' said Simaghan 'rejoice We will burn youbefore our wig-wams.'"'That is good news' I said and thereupon I sang my song of death."Although the Creeks were my enemies I could not help admiring them.They were fine handsome men of a merry and open nature and their womenwere beautiful and full of pity towards me. One night while I waslying sleepless beside their camp fire one of their maidens came andsat by my side. Her face was strangely lovely her eyes shone withtears and a little golden crucifix on her bosom glittered as thefirelight played upon it."'Maiden' I said 'your beauty is too great to be wasted on a dyingman. Let me die without tasting the delights of love. They would onlymake death more bitter to me. You are worthy to be the squaw of a greatchief. Wait till you can find a lover with whom you can live in joy andhappiness all your life.'"'Are you a Christian' asked the maiden."'No' I replied. 'I have not betrayed the faith of my forefathers.'"'Oh you are only a wicked heathen' she exclaimed covering her facewith her hands and weeping. 'I have been baptised by my mother. I amAtala daughter of Simaghan of the golden bracelets and the chief ofthis band. We are going to Cuscowilla where you will be burnt.'"And with a look of anger Atala rose up and went away."Here Chactas for a moment became silent. Tears rolled from his blindeyes down his withered cheeks."Oh Ren my son" he said "you see that Chactas is very foolish inspite of his reputation for wisdom Why do men still weep even when agehas blinded their eyes Every night Atala came to see me and a strangelove for her was born in my heart. After marching for seventeen days mycaptors brought me to the great savannah of Alachua and camped in avalley not far from Cuscowilla the capital of the Creeks. I was boundto the foot of a tree outside the town and a warrior was set to watchover me."But in the evening Atala came and said to him 'If you would like togo hunting I will look after the prisoner.'"The young warrior leaped up full of joy at being relieved by thedaughter of his chief and when he had gone Atala released me."'Now Chactas' she murmured turning her face away from me 'you canescape.'"'I do not want to escape' I cried 'unless I can escape with you'"'But they will burn you' she said. 'They will burn you to-morrow'"'What does it matter' I exclaimed 'if you do not love me'"'But I do love you' said Atala and she bent over and kissed me.
comment327,"Then with a wild look of terror she pushed me away from her andstaggering up to the tree she covered her face with her hands andsobbed rocking herself to and fro in her grief."'Oh my mother my mother' she sobbed. 'I have forgotten my vow. Icannot follow you' she said turning to me. 'You are not a Christian.'"'But I will be a Christian' I cried. 'Only come with me Atala and Iwill be baptised by the first priest that we meet. There are severalmissionaries among the Natchez.'"To my utter astonishment instead of this comforting Atala it onlymade her weep more passionately. Her body shook with sobs as I took herup in my arms and carried her away from the town into the great forest.At last she grew calmer and asked me to set her down and striking anarrow track between the dark trees we marched along silently andquickly stopping now and then to listen if we were being followed. Weheard nothing but the crackling tread of some nocturnal beast of preyor the cry of some animal in the agony of death. On coming to an openingin the forest I made a shelter for the night. Atala then threw herselfat my feet and clasped my knees and again begged me to leave her. ButI swore that if she returned to the camp I would follow her and givemyself up. As we were talking the cry of death rang through the forestand four warriors fell upon me and bound me. Our flight had beendiscovered and Simaghan had set out in pursuit with all his band."In vain did Atala plead for me I was condemned to be burnt. Happilythe Feast of Souls was being held and no tribe dares to kill a captiveduring the days consecrated to this solemn ceremony. But after the feastI was bound down on the ground before the sacred totem pillars and allthe maidens and warriors of the Creek nation danced around me chantingsongs of triumph. Again I sang my song of death."'I do not fear your torments For I am brave I defy you for you areall weaker than women. My father Outalissi has drunk from the skullsof your bravest warriors. Burn me Torture me But you will not make megroan you will not make me sigh.'"Angered by my song a Creek warrior stabbed me in the arm. 'Thank you'I said."To make sure that I should not again escape they bound cords around myneck and feet and arms the ends of these cords were fastened in theearth by means of pegs and a band of warriors set to watch over me laiddown on the cords so that I could not make a single movement of whichthey were not aware. The songs and dances gradually ceased as night cameon and the camp fires burnt low and red and in spite of my pain Itoo fell asleep. I dreamt that someone was setting me free and Iseemed to feel that sharp anguish which shoots along the nerves whenropes which are bound so tightly as to stop the flow of blood aresuddenly cut from the numbed limbs. The pain became so keen that it mademe open my eyes. A tall white figure was bending over me silentlycutting my cords. It was Atala. I rose up and followed her through thesleeping camp."When we were out of ear-shot she told me that she had bribed themedicine man of her tribe and brought some barrels of fire-water into
comment328,the camp and made all the warriors drunk with it. Drunkenness no doubtprevented the Creeks from following us for a day or two. And ifafterwards they pursued us they probably turned to the west thinkingthat we had set out in the direction of the country of Natchez. But wehad gone north tracking our way by the moss growing on the trunks ofthe trees."_II.--The Magic of the Forest_"The Creeks had stripped me almost naked but Atala made me a dress outof the inner bark of the ash-tree and sewed some rat-skins intomoccasins. I in turn wove garlands of flowers for her head as wetramped along through the great forests of Florida. Oh how wildlybeautiful the scenes were through which we passed. Nearly all the treesin Florida are covered with a white moss which hangs from their branchesto the ground. At night-time when the moonlight falls pearly grey onthe indeterminate crest of the forests the trees look like an army ofphantoms in long trailing veils. In the daytime a crowd of largebeautiful butterflies brilliant humming birds and blue-winged jays andparroquets come and cling to the moss which then resembles a whitetapestry embroidered with splendid and varied hues."Every evening we made a great fire and built a shelter out of a largehollow piece of bark fixed on four stakes. The forests were full ofgame which I easily brought down with the bow and arrows I took when wefled from the camp and as it was now autumn the forests were hung withfruit. Every day I became more and more joyful but Atala was strangelyquiet. Sometimes as I suddenly turned my head to see why she was sosilent I would find her gazing at me her eyes burning with passion.Sometimes she would kneel down and clasp her hands in prayer and weeplike a woman with a broken heart. What frightened me above all was thesecret thought that she tried to conceal in the depths of her soul butnow and then half revealed in her wild sorrowful and lovely eyes. Ohhow many times did she tell me"'Yes I love you Chactas I love you But I can never be your wife'"I could not understand her. One minute she would cling round my neckand kiss me another when I wished in turn to caress her she wouldrepulse me."'But as I intend Atala to become a Christian what is there toprevent us marrying' I said again and again.
comment329,"And every time I asked this question she burst into tears and would notanswer. But the wild loneliness the continual presence of my belovedyes even the hardships of our wandering life increased the force of mylonging. A hundred times I was ready to fold Atala to my breast. Ahundred times I proposed to build her a hut in the wide uninhabitedwilderness and live my life out there by her side."Oh Ren my son if your heart is ever deeply troubled by love bewareof loneliness. Great passions are wild and solitary things bytransporting them into the wilderness you give them full power over yoursoul. But in spite of this Atala and I lived together in the greatforests like brother and sister. On and on we marched through vaults offlowery smilax where lianas with strange and gorgeous blossoms snaredour feet in their twining ropy stems. Enormous bats fluttered in ourfaces rattlesnakes rattled around us and bears and carcajous--thoselittle tigers that crouch on the branches of trees and leap withoutwarning on their prey--made the latter part of our journey full ofstrange perils and difficulties. For after travelling for twenty-sevendays we crossed the Alleghany mountains and got into a tract ofswampy wooded ground."At sunset a tempest arose and darkened all the heavens. Then the skyopened and the noise of the tempestuous forest was drowned in longrolling detonations of thunder and the wild lightning flamed down uponus and set the forest on fire. Crouching down under the bent trunk of abirch-tree with my beloved on my lap I sheltered her from thestreaming rain and warmed her naked feet in my hands. What cared Ithough the very heavens broke above me and the earth rocked to itsfoundations The soft warm arms of Atala were around my neck herbreast lay against my breast and I felt her heart beating as wildly asmy own."'O my beloved' I said 'open your heart to me and tell me the secretthat makes you so sorrowful. Do you weep at leaving your native land'"'No' she said. 'I do not regret leaving the land of palm trees for mymother is dead and Simaghan was only my foster father.'"'Then who was your father my beloved' I cried in astonishment."'My father was a Spaniard' said Atala 'but my grandmother threw waterin his face and made him go away and she then forced my mother to giveherself in marriage to Simaghan who desired her. But she died fromgrief at being parted from my father and Simaghan adopted me as his owndaughter. I have never seen my father though my mother before shedied baptised me so that his God should be my God. Oh Chactas I wishI could see my father before I die'"'What is his name' I said. 'Where does he live'"'He lives at St. Augustin' she replied. 'His name is Philip Lopez.'"'O my beloved' I cried pressing Atala wildly to may breast. 'Ohwhat happiness what joy You are the daughter of Lopez the daughter ofmy foster father'"Atala was frightened at my outburst of passion but when she knew thatit was her father who had rescued me from the Creeks and brought me upas his own son she became as wildly joyful as I was. Rising up from myarms with a strange fierce and yet tender light in her eyes she tooksomething out of her bosom and put in her mouth and then fell on mybreast in an ecstasy of self-surrender. Just as I was about to embraceher the lightning fell the sword of God upon the surging stormyforest and made a wild and terrible radiance around us and shattered agreat tree at our feet. We rose up overcome by a sacred horror andfled. And then an even more miraculous thing happened. As the rolling
comment330,thunder died away we heard in the silence and the darkness the sound ofa bell. A dog barked and came running joyfully up to us. Behind him wasan old white-haired priest carrying a lantern in his hand."'Dear God' said the priest. 'How young they are Poor children My dogfound you in the forest just before the storm broke and ran back to mycave to fetch me. I have brought some wine in my calabash. Drink it itwill revive you. Did you not hear the mission bell which we ring everynight so that strangers may find their way'"'Save me father save me' cried Atala falling to the ground. 'I am aChristian and I do not want to die in mortal sin.'"What was the matter with her She was as pale as death and unable torise. I bent over her and so did the missionary."'Oh Chactas' she murmured 'I am dying. Just before the lightningstruck the tree at our feet I took some poison. For I felt that I couldno longer resist you my beloved and I was resolved to save myself indeath.'"'But here is a priest' I said. 'I will be baptised at once and we canbe married immediately afterwards.'"'I could not marry you even then' she said. 'I was sixteen years oldwhen my mother died and in order to preserve me from marrying any ofthe heathen savages among whom my lot was cast she made me vow on theimage of Mary the Mother of my God that I would remain all my life apure Christian virgin.'"Oh Ren how I hated the God of the Christians at that moment I drewmy tomahawk resolved to kill the missionary on the spot. Butdisregarding me he bent over Atala and raised her head upon his knees."'My dear child your vow does not prevent you from marrying your loverespecially as he is willing to become a Christian. I will write at onceto the Bishop of Quebec who has the power to relieve you of any vowthat you have made and then there will be nothing to prevent yourmarriage.'"As he spoke Atala was seized with a convulsion which shook all herbody. In wild agony she cried 'Oh it is too late it is too late Ithought my mother's spirit would come and drag me down to hell if Ibroke my vow. I took poison with me Chactas when I fled with you. Ihave just swallowed it. There is no remedy. Oh God Oh God'"She was dead in my arms. I buried her where she died and had it notbeen for the missionary Ren I would have laid down in the grave byher side and let the blood well out of all my veins. But I became aChristian as you know and then finding some work in the world to doI went back to my own tribe and converted them. I have been to France.I have seen your great king Louis XIV. I have talked with BishopBossuet and it was he who convinced me that I could best serve God byreturning to my own people the Natchez and trying to form them into agreat Christian nation under the guidance of the King of France."                                   CHARLES VICTOR CHERBULIEZSamuel Brohl  Co.      Charles Victor Cherbuliez was born in Geneva Switzerland in     1829 studied history and philosophy in Paris Bonn and Berlin     and travelled widely gathering material that he used in     social and political essays and also in fiction. He won fame     with his first novel "Count Kostia" published in 1863. After
comment331,     that date his romances followed in quick succession. Embodying     extravagant adventures they must be classed nevertheless in     the category of the sentimental novel to which the writings of     Sand and Feuillet belong. Cherbuliez is always an interesting     story-teller and an ingenious artificer of plot but his     psychology is conventional and his descriptive passages     superficial though clever. "Samuel Brohl  Co." published in     1877 illustrates his power of drawing cosmopolitan types     Russians Poles English Germans and Jews which he portrays     in all his novels. He was admitted to the French Academy in     1881 and died in 1899._I.--A Mountain Romance_"Yes she is certainly very beautiful as well as very rich" said CountAbel Larinski as he watched through his hotel window the gracefulfigure of Mlle. Antoinette Moriaz. "A marriage between Count AbelLarinski the sole descendant of one of the most ancient and noblefamilies of Poland and Mlle. Moriaz the daughter of the President ofthe French Institute is a thing which might be arranged. But alasCount Abel Larinski you are a very poor man. Let me see how long youwill be able to stay in Saint Moritz These hotels in the Upper Engadineare frightfully dear"The handsome young Polish nobleman opened his purse and looked at thecontents rather sadly. It was almost empty. He would certainly have tosell some of his family jewels if he wanted to stay at Saint Moritz.Unhappily he now had only the fine diamond ring which he wore on hisfinger and a Persian bracelet composed of three golden plates connectedby a band of filigree work."Now which shall I sell" said the Count "the Larinski ring or thebracelet which belonged to Samuel Brohl The ring I think. It willbring in much more money and besides the bracelet might be useful as apresent."After strolling some time about the garden Mlle. Moriaz saw her fatherwaiting for her at the door."What do you think Antoinette of an excursion to Silvaplana Lake"said M. Moriaz. "I'm feeling so much better already and I absolutelylong my dear for a good walk.""I should be delighted" said his daughter "if you think it will nottire you."M. Moriaz was sure an excursion would not tire him. So they set out fora long walk through the wild mountain scenery. Antoinette was delightedto find that her father was recovering his strength but he wasalarmingly quiet and thoughtful. Was she in for one of those seriouslectures on the subject of marriage which he used to read to her atParis Yes Camille must have written to him. For as she was standing ona mountain bridge listening to the liquid gurgling of the torrent atthe bottom of the gorge she said to him"Isn't the music of this wild stream delightful""Yes" he replied. "But I think this bridge that spans the gorge is amore wonderful thing than all the wild works of nature around us. Iadmire men like our friend Camille Langis who know how to build thesebridges. What a fine fellow he is Most men with his wealth lead idle
comment332,useless lives. But there he is now building bridges across mountainsjust as wild as these in Hungary. Why don't you marry him my dear Heis madly in love with you and you have known him all your life.""That's just it" said his daughter with a movement of impatience "Ihave known him all my life. How can I now fall wildly and suddenly inlove with him No If ever I lose my heart I am sure it will be to somestranger to someone quite different from all the men we meet in Paris.""You are incorrigibly romantic Antoinette" said her father with justa touch of ill-humour. "You want a fairy prince eh--one of thosestrange picturesque impossible creatures that only exist in theimagination of poets and school girls. You are now twenty-four yearsold Antoinette and if you don't soon become more reasonable you willdie an old maid.""Would that be a very great misfortune father darling" said Antoinettewith a roguish smile. "If ever I marry you know I shall have to leaveyou. And what would you do then You would be driven to marry yourcook"This sally put the old scientist in a good humour. His daughter was thecharm and solace of his life and though he would have liked to see herhappily married he did not know what he should do when she left him. Onthe way back to the hotel Antoinette tried to find some edelweiss butshe was not able to clamber up to the high rocks on which this rareflower grows. Great therefore were her joy and surprise on returning tothe hotel to find on the table of her room a wicker basket full ofedelweiss and rarer Alpine flowers. Was it for her Yes For in thebasket was a note addressed "Mlle. Moriaz." Fluttering with excitementshe opened it and read      "I arrived in this valley disgusted with life sad and     weary to death. But I saw you pass by my window and some     strange new power entered my soul. Now I know that I shall     live and accomplish my work in the world. 'What does this     matter to me' you will say when you read these lines--and you     will be right. My only excuse for writing to you in this way     is that I shall depart in a few days and that you will never     see me and never know who I am."After getting over her first impression of profound astonishmentAntoinette laughed and then gave way to curiosity. Who had brought theflowers "A little peasant boy" said the hotel porter "but I did notknow him. He must have come from another village."For some days Mlle. Moriaz glanced at everybody she met but she neverfound a single romantic figure in the crowd of invalids that saunteredabout St. Moritz. If however she had always accompanied her fatherwho growing stronger every day began to go out on long geologicalexcursions she might have met a very picturesque and striking youngman. For Count Abel Larinski now always followed M. Moriaz and watchedover him like a guardian angel. "Oh if he would only fall down one ofthe rocks he is always hammering at and break a leg or even sprain anankle" said the gallant Polish nobleman. "Wouldn't that be a luckyaccident for me"All things it is said come to those who know how to wait. Oneafternoon M. Moriaz climbed up a very steep slope of crumbling rock and
comment333,came to a narrow gorge over which he was afraid to leap. He could notdescend by the way he had come up for the slope was really dangerous.It looked as though he should have to wait hours and perhaps daysuntil some herdsman passed by and he began to shout wildly in the hopesof attracting attention. To his great joy his shout was answered andCount Larinski climbed up the other side of the gorge carrying a planktorn from a fence he passed on his way. By means of this he bridged thegorge and rescued the father of Antoinette and naturally he had toaccompany him to the hotel and stay to dinner. As we have said CountLarinski was a very handsome man tall broad-shouldered with strangegreen eyes touched with soft golden tints. When he began to talk simplyand modestly of the part he had played in the last Polish Revolutionagainst the despotic power of Russia Antoinette felt at last that shewas in the presence of a hero. And what a cultivated man he was Heplayed the piano divinely and they passed many pleasant eveningstogether. One night the Count left behind him a piece of musicinscribed "Abel Larinski." "Surely" Mlle. Moriaz thought "I have seenthat writing somewhere" Her breath came quickly as with a tremblinghand she took out of her bosom the letter which had been sent with theflowers and compared the handwritings. They were identical._II.--A Conversation with a Dead Man_Just a week afterwards Count Larinski had a very serious conversationwith his partner Samuel Brohl. The strange thing about the conversationwas that there was only one man in the room and he talked all the timeto himself. Sometimes he spoke in German with lapses into Yiddish andany one would then have said that he was Samuel Brohl a notoriousJewish adventurer. Then recovering himself he talked in Polish and hemight have been mistaken for a Polish gentleman. He seemed to be a manwho was trying to study a difficult matter from two different points ofview and he undoubtedly had an actor's talent for throwing himself intothe character of the nobleman he was impersonating."Do you see" said Samuel Brohl "fortune at last smiles upon us. Thecharming girl is ours. I have won her for you dear Larinski by themeans Othello used to charm the imagination and capture the heart ofDesdemona. Do you not remember my dear Count the tales you used totell us when we were living together in a garret in Bucharest How youfought in the streets of Warsaw against the Cossacks How they trackedyou through the snow-covered forest by the trail of blood you leftbehind you Oh I recollected it all and I flatter myself that Irelated it with just that proud sombre subdued melancholy with whichyou used to speak of your sufferings.""Do you think that she has really fallen in love with me" asked CountLarinski. "I am afraid of her father. In spite of all that I have donefor that famous man of science he does not seem to fancy me as ason-in-law. Do you imagine it is merely because of my poverty Or doeshe find anything wrong with me"This last question profoundly disturbed the soul of Samuel Brohl. Whatwere all the skilful intrigues which he had spent four years in weavingto come to nothing For it was now four years since Samuel Brohl hadentered into his strange partnership with the Polish nobleman. Brohlhimself was the son of a Jewish tavern-keeper in Gallicia. A great
comment334,Russian lady Princess Gulof attracted by his handsome presence andstrange green eyes had engaged him as her secretary and educated him.He had repaid her by robbing her of her jewels and running off with themto Bucharest. There he had met Count Larinski who for more honourablemotives was also hiding from the Russian secret police. By representinghimself as a persecuted anarchist Brohl completely won the confidenceof large-hearted chivalrous Polish patriot."Ah it was a lucky chance that brought us together" said Samuel Brohl."If you had not met me you would have been dead four years ago andclean forgotten. Do you remember your last instructions After giving meevery bit of money you had--a little over two thousand florins wasn'tit--you showed me a box containing your family jewels your lettersyour diary your papers and you said to me 'Destroy everything itcontains. Poland is dead. Let my name die too'"But my dear Count" continued Samuel Brohl "how could I let a man ofyour heroic worth and romantic character be forgotten by the world Noit was Samuel Brohl who died and was buried in an unknown grave. I havethe certificate of his death. Count Abel Larinski still lives. It istrue that he is so changed by all his sufferings that his oldest friendswould never recognise him. His hair used to be black it is now brownhis blue eyes have become golden green moreover he has grownconsiderably taller. But what does it matter He is still a handsomeman with a noble air and charming manner.""Very well" said Count Larinski. "I must take the risk of meeting inParis anyone who used to know me before my transformation. I will packup and depart."It was indeed a terrible ordeal which he had to face. By a strange ironyof fate all his skilfully conceived plans were imperilled at the verymoment when his success seemed absolutely certain. As he had foreseenM. Moriaz was not at first inclined to consent to the marriage butAntoinette soon won her father over and when Count Larinski called attheir charming villa at Cormeilles on the outskirts of Paris he had aswarm a welcome as the most ardent of suitors could desire."We must introduce you my dear Count to all our friends" said M.Moriaz. "We are giving a party to-morrow evening for the purpose. Ofcourse you will be able to attend""Naturally" said Larinski "I am looking forward with the greatesteagerness to making the acquaintance of all Antoinette's friends. Theonly thing I regret is that none of my old comrades in the greatstruggle against Russia can be at my side at the happiest moment of mylife. Alas many are working in fetters in the mines of Siberia and therest are scattered over the face of the globe."_III.--Samuel Brohl Comes to Life_But though none of Count Larinski's friends was able to appear atCormeilles one of Samuel Brohl's old acquaintances came to the party.On entering the drawing-room he saw an old ugly sharp-faced womantalking in a corner with Camille Langis. It was Princess Gulof. Itseemed to him as if the four walls of the room were rocking to and froand that the floor was slipping from under his feet like the deck of aship in a wild storm. By a great effort of will he recovered himself."Never mind Samuel Brohl" he said to himself. "Let us see the gamethrough. After all she is very shortsighted and you may have changed inthe last four years."Antoinette presented him to the Princess who examined him with herlittle blinking eyes and smiled on him kindly and calmly."What luck What amazing luck" he thought. "She is now as blind as anowl. If only I can escape from talking to her I'm safe."Unfortunately Antoinette asked him to take the Princess in to dinner.He offered her his arm and led her to the table in absolute silence.She too did not speak but when they sat down she began to talk gailyto the priest of the parish who was sitting on her right. Her sight wasso bad that she had to bend over her wineglasses to find the one shewanted. Seeing this Samuel Brohl recovered his self-confidence.
comment335,"She can't have recognised me" he thought "my voice my accent mybearing everything has changed. Poland has entered into my blood. I amno longer Samuel I am Larinski."Boldly entering into the general conversation he related with amelancholy grace a story of the Polish insurrection shaking hislion-like mane of hair and speaking with tears in his voice. It wasimpossible to be more of a Larinski than he was at that moment. When hefinished a murmur of admiration ran round the table."Although we are mortal enemies Count" said the Princess Gulof "allowme to congratulate you. I hear you have won the hand of Mlle. Moriaz.""Mortal enemies" he said in a low troubled voice. "Why are we mortalenemies my dear Princess""Because I am a Russian and you are a Pole" she replied. "But we shallnot have time to quarrel. I am leaving for London at seven o'clockto-morrow morning. What is the date of your wedding""If I dared hope that you would do me the honour to attend it" he saidskilfully evading answering her question "I might put it off until yourreturn from England.""You are too kind" said the Princess. "I would not think of delayingthe happy event to which Mile. Moriaz so eagerly looks forward. What abeautiful girl she is I dare not ask you what is her fortune. You areI can see an idealist. You do not trouble yourself with matters ofmoney. But oh you poor idealists" she whispered leaning over him witha friendly air "you always come to grief in the end""How is that" he said with a smile."You dream with your eyes open my dear Count Larinski and yourawakening is sometimes sudden and unpleasant."Then advancing her head towards her companion her little eyes flaminglike a viper's she whispered "Samuel Brohl I knew you all along. Yourdream has come to an end."A cold sweat broke out on the forehead of the adventurer. Leaning overthe Princess his face convulsed with hatred he murmured"Samuel Brohl is not the sort of man to put up with an injury. Someyears ago he received two letters from you. If ever he is attacked hewill publish them."Rising up he made her a low bow and took leave of Mlle. Moriaz and herfather and left the house. At first he was utterly downcast andinclined to give up the game but as he tramped back to Paris in themoonlight his courage returned. He had two letters which the Princesshad written to him when she was engaged in Paris on a political missionof great importance and they contained some amazing indiscretions inregard to the private lives of several august personages."No" he said to himself "she will think twice before she interferes inmy affairs. I can ruin her as easily as she can ruin me."As a matter of fact Princess Gulof was unable to sleep all that night.She was torn between the desire for vengeance and the fear of reprisals._IV.--The Partnership is Dissolved_The next morning after breakfast Mlle. Moriaz was surprised to receivea visit from Princess Gulof."I have come to see you about your marriage" said the Princess."You are very kind" replied Mlle. Moriaz "but I do not understand....""You will understand in a minute" said the Princess. "There's a story Iwant to tell you and I think you will find it interesting. Fourteenyears ago I was passing through a village in Gallicia and the badweather forced me to put up at a dirty inn kept by a Jew called Brohl.This Jew had a son Samuel a youngster with strange green eyes and ahandsome figure. Finding that he was an intelligent lad I paid for himto study at the University and later on I kept him as my privatesecretary. But about four years ago Samuel Brohl ran off with all myjewellery.""You were indeed badly rewarded for your kindness Madame." interruptedAntoinette "but I do not see what Samuel Brohl has to do with mymarriage.""I was going to tell you" said the Princess. "I had the pleasure ofmeeting him here last night. He has got on since I lost sight of him. He
comment336,is not content with changing from a Jew into a Pole he is now a greatnobleman. He calls himself Count Abel Larinski and he is engaged to bemarried to Mlle. Moriaz. She is now wearing a Persian bracelet he stolefrom me.""Madame" cried Antoinette her cheeks flushing with anger "will youdare to tell Count Larinski in my presence that he is this SamuelBrohl you speak of""I have no desire to do so" said the Princess. "Indeed I want you topromise me never to tell him that it was I who showed him up. Wait Ihave thought of something. The middle plate of my Persian bracelet usedto open with a secret spring. Open yours and if you find my name therewell you will know where it came from.""Unless you are willing to repeat in the presence of myself and CountLarinski all that you have just said" exclaimed Antoinette haughtily"there is only one thing I can promise you. I shall certainly neverrelate to the man to whom I have the honour to be betrothed a singleword of the silly wicked slanders that you have uttered."Princess Gulof rose up brusquely and stood for a while looking atAntoinette in silence."So you do not believe me" she said in an ironic tone blinking herlittle eyes. "You are right. Old women you know seldom talk sense.Samuel Brohl never existed and I had the pleasure of dining last nightwith the most authentic of all the Larinskis. Pardon me and accept mybest wishes for the life-long happiness of the Count and Countess."Thereupon she made a mocking curtsey and turned on her heels anddisappeared."The woman is absolutely mad" said Antoinette. "Abel will be here in afew minutes and he will tell me what is the matter with her. I supposedthey quarrelled last night about Poland. Oh dear what funny old womenthere are in the world"As she was waiting for her lover to appear Camille Langis came to thehouse. Naturally she was not desirous of talking with her rejectedsuitor at that moment and she gave him a rather frigid welcome."I see you don't want me" said Camille sadly turning away."Of course I want you" she said touched by the feeling he showed. "Youare my oldest and dearest friend."For a few minutes they sat talking together and Camille noticed thestrange bracelet on her wrist and praised its curious design.
comment337,Antoinette struck by a sudden idea took off the Persian ornament andgave it to Camille saying"One of these plates I believe opens by a secret spring. You are anengineer can you find this spring for me""The middle plate is hollow" said Langis tapping it with a pen-knife"the other two are solid gold. Oh what a clumsy fool I am I havebroken it open.""Is there any writing" said Antoinette. "Let me look."Yes there was a long list of dates and at the end of the dates werewritten "Nothing nothing nothing that is all. Anna Gulof."Antoinette became deathly pale something seemed to break in her headshe felt that if she did not speak her mind would give way. Yes shecould trust Camille but how should she begin She felt that she wasstifling and could not draw in enough air to keep breathing."What is the matter with you dear Antoinette" said Camille alarmed byher pallor and her staring eyes.She began to speak in a low confused and broken voice and Camille atfirst could not understand what she was saying. But at last he did soand his soul was then divided between an immense pity for the grief thatoverwhelmed her and a ferocious joy at the thought of the utter rout ofhis successful rival. Suddenly a step was heard on the garden path."Here he is" said Antoinette. "No stay in here. I will call you if Iwant you. In spite of all I have said I shall never believe that he hasdeceived me unless I read the lie in his very eyes."Instead of waiting for the visitor to be shown into her room she ranout and met him in the garden. He came up to her smiling thinking thatwith the departure of Princess Gulof all danger had vanished. But whenhe saw the white face and burning eyes of Antoinette he guessed thatshe knew everything. He determined however to try and carry it off bysheer audacity."I am sorry I left so early last evening" he said "but that madRussian woman whom I took into dinner made me almost as crazy as shewas herself. She ought to be in an asylum. But the night repaid me forall the worries of the evening. I dreamt of the Engadine its emeraldlakes its pine-trees and its edelweiss.""I too had a dream last night" said Antoinette slowly. "I dreamt thatthis bracelet which you gave me belonged to the mad Russian woman and
comment338,that she had engraved her name inside it." She threw the bracelet athim. He picked it up and turned it round and round in his tremblingfingers looking at the plate which had been forced open."Can you tell me what I ought to think of Samuel Brohl" she asked.The name fell on him like a mass of lead he reeled under the blowthen striking his head with his two fists he answered"Samuel Brohl is a man worthy of your pity. If you only knew all that hehas suffered all he has dared to do you could not help pitying himyes and admiring him. Samuel Brohl is an unfortunate ...""Scoundrel" she said in a terrible voice. "Madame Brohl"--she began tolaugh hysterically--"Madame Brohl No I can't become Madame Brohl. Ahthat poor Countess Larinski.""You did not love the man" he said bitterly "only the Count.""The man I loved did not tell lies" she replied."Yes I lied to you" he said panting like a hunted animal "and I takeall the shame of it gladly. I lied because I loved you to madness and Ilied because you are dearer to me than honour I lied because Idespaired of touching your heart and I did not care by what means I wonyou. Why did I ever meet you Why couldn't I have passed you by withoutyou becoming the dream of my whole life I have lied. Who would not lieto be loved by you"Never had Samuel Brohl appeared so beautiful. Despair and passionlighted up his strange green eyes with a sombre flame. He had thesinister charm of a fallen archangel and he fixed on Antoinette a wildfascinating glance that said"What do my name my deceptions and the rest matter to you My face atleast is not a mask and the man who moved you the man who won you wasI."Mlle. Moriaz however divined the thought in the eyes of Samuel Brohl."You are a good actor" she said between her teeth. "But it is time thatthis comedy came to an end."He threw himself on the grass at her feet and then sprang up and triedto clasp her in his arms."Camille Camille" she cried "save me from this man."Langis darted out after Brohl and the Jew took to his heels. Langiswould have followed him as gladly as a hound follows a fox but he sawAntoinette's strength had given way and running up to her he caught
comment339,her in his arms as she reeled and tenderly carried her into the house.That evening Count Abel Larinski disappeared from the world. SamuelBrohl rose up from his grave at Bucharest and took the name of Kicksand emigrated to America some time before the marriage of Mlle. Moriazto M. Camille Langis was announced in the "Figaro."                                   WILKIE COLLINSNo Name      William Wilkie Collins was born in London on January 8 1824.     From the age of eight to fifteen he resided with his parents     in Italy and on their return to England young Collins was     apprenticed to a firm of tea-merchants abandoning that     business four years later for the law. This profession also     failed to appeal to him although what he learned in it proved     extremely useful to him in his literary career. His first     published book was a "Life" of his father William Collins     R.A. in 1847. The success of the work gave him an incentive     towards writing and three years later he published an     historical romance "Antonina or The Fall of Rome." About     this time he made the acquaintance of Charles Dickens who was     then editor of "Household Words" to which periodical he     contributed some of his most successful fiction. "No Name"     published in 1862 depended less upon dramatic situations and     more upon analysis of character and the solution of a problem.     That he was successful in his purpose is chiefly evidenced by     the wide popularity the story received on its appearance. "The     main object of the story" he wrote in the introduction to the     first edition "is to appeal to the reader's interest in a     subject which has been the theme of some of the greatest     writers living and dead but which has never been and can     never be exhausted because it is a subject eternally     interesting to all mankind. A book that depicts the struggle     of a human creature under those opposing influences of Good     and Evil which we have all felt which we have all known."     Like others of Collins' stories "No Name" was successfully     presented on the stage. Wilkie Collins died on September 23     1889._I.--Nobody's Children_A letter from America bearing a New Orleans stamp had an extraordinaryeffect on the spirits of the Vanstone family as they sat round thebreakfast table at Coome-Raven in West Somersetshire."An American letter papa" exclaimed Magdalen the youngest daughterlooking over her father's shoulder. "Who do you know at New Orleans"Mrs. Vanstone sitting propped up with cushions at the other end of thetable started and looked eagerly at her husband. Mr. Vanstone saidnothing but his air of preoccupation and his unusual seriousness whichnot even Magdalen's playfulness affected proved clearly that something
comment340,was wrong. The mystery of the letter puzzled both Magdalen and her eldersister Norah and in particular aroused a feeling of uneasinessimpossible to explain in the mind of the old family friend andgoverness Miss Garth.Though neither Mr. nor Mrs. Vanstone offered any explanation Miss Garthfelt more than ever certain that something unusual had occurred whenon the following day they announced their intention of going to Londonon private business. For nearly a month they stayed away and at the endof that period returned without offering any account of what they haddone on their mysterious visit.Life at Coome-Raven went on as usual in a round of pleasantdistractions. Concerts dances and private theatricals in whichMagdalen cut a great figure winning even the praise of the professionalmanager who begged her to call on him if ever she should require a realengagement passed the weeks rapidly by.To Magdalen also the return of Frank Clare the son of a very oldfriend of Mr. Vanstone's provided an interesting interlude. As hisfather put it "Frank had turned up at home again like a bad penny andwas now lurking after the manner of louts." Though Mr. Clare's estimateof his son was frankly truthful Magdalen loved him with all thepassionate warmth of her nature and when Frank in order to escapebeing sent to a business appointment in China proposed marriage to hershe accepted him joyfully. She urged her father to consent to theirimmediate union."I must consult Frank's father of course" he said in conclusion. "Wemust not forget that Mr. Clare's consent is still wanting to settle thismatter. And as we don't know what difficulties he may raise the soonerI see him the better."In a state of obvious dejection he walked over to the house which Mr.Clare occupied. When after some hours he returned once more toCoome-Raven he informed his daughter that Frank was to have anotheryear's trial in London. If he proved himself capable he should berewarded at the end of that time with Magdalen's hand.Both the girl and Frank were delighted but Mr. Vanstone did not reflecttheir good spirits. He wired to his lawyer Mr. Pendril to come downfrom town at once to Coome-Raven. So anxious was he to see his lawyerthat he drove over to the local station and took the train to theneighbouring junction where Mr. Pendril would have to change.Hours went by and he did not return. As the evening closed down amessage was brought to Miss Garth that a man wished to speak to her. Shehurried out and found herself face to face with a porter from thejunction who explained that there had been an accident to the downtrain at 1.50."God help us" exclaimed the governess. "The train Mr. Vanstonetravelled by""The same. There are seven passengers badly hurt and two------"The next word failed on his lips he raised his hand in the deadsilence. With eyes that opened wide in horror he pointed over MissGarth's shoulder. She turned to see her mistress standing on thethreshold with staring vacant eyes. With a dreadful stillness in hervoice she repeated the man's last words "Seven passengers badly hurtand two------"Then she sank swooning into Miss Garth's arms.From the shock of her husband's death Mrs. Vanstone never recovered.Heartbroken by the death of their parents Norah and Magdalen had yet tolearn the full extent of the tragedy. That was first made clear to MissGarth by the lawyer.Mr. Andrew Vanstone in his youth had joined the army and gone to Canada.There he had been entrapped by a woman whom he had married--a woman soutterly vile and unprincipled that he was forced to leave her and returnto England. Shortly afterwards his father died and having beenestranged from his elder son Michael Vanstone bequeathed all hisproperty to Andrew.Andrew Vanstone passed his life in a round of vicious pleasures but as
comment341,his better nature had almost been destroyed by a woman so now it wasretrieved by a woman. He fell in love told the girl of his heart thetruth about himself and she out of the love she bore him determinedto pass the rest of her life by his side and Norah and Magdalen werethe children of their union."Tell me" said Miss Garth in a voice faint with emotion as the lawyerlaid bare the sad story "why did they go to London""They went to London to be married" cried Mr. Pendril.In the letter from New Orleans Mr. Vanstone had heard of the death ofhis wife and he had at once taken the necessary steps to make the womanwho had so long been his wife in the eyes of God his wife in the eyes ofthe law. The story would never have been known had it not been forFrank's engagement to Magdalen. The soul of honour Mr. Vanstone thoughtit his duty to inform Mr. Clare fully regarding his relations with Mrs.Vanstone. His old friend proved himself deeply sympathetic and thenbeing a cautious man of business inquired what steps Mr. Vanstone hadtaken to provide for his daughters. The master of Coombe-Raven repliedthat he had long ago made a will leaving them all he possessed. When Mr.Clare pointed out that his recent marriage automatically destroyed theeffect of this testament he was greatly distressed and hasteninghome had at once telegraphed to Mr. Pendril to come to Coome-Raven todraw up another will without any loss of time. His tragic death hadprevented the execution of this plan and the inability of Mrs. Vanstoneto sign any document before she died had resulted in Norah and Magdalenbeing left absolutely penniless and the estates passing to MichaelVanstone."How am I to tell them" exclaimed Miss Garth."There is no need to tell them" said a voice behind her. "They know italready. Mr. Vanstone's daughters are 'nobody's children' and the lawleaves them helpless at their uncle's mercy"It was Magdalen who spoke--Magdalen with a changeless stillness on herwhite face and an icy resignation in her steady grey eyes. From underthe open window of the room in which Mr. Pendril had told his story thisgirl of eighteen had heard every word and never once betrayed herself."I understand that my late brother"--so ran Michael Vanstone's letter ofinstruction to his solicitor--"has left two illegitimate children bothof them young women who are of an age to earn their own livelihood. Be
comment342,so good as to tell them that neither you nor I have anything to do withquestions of mere sentiment. Let them understand that Providence hasrestored to me the inheritance that ought always to have been mine andI will not invite retribution on my own head by assisting those childrento continue the imposition which their parents practised and by helpingthem to take a place in the world to which they are not entitled.""Norah" said Magdalen turning to her sister "if we both live to growold and if ever you forget all we owe to Michael Vanstone--come to meand I will remind you."_II.--Tricked into Marriage_By fair means or foul Magdalen who with Norah had now made her homewith Miss Garth in London had sworn to herself that she would win backthe property of which she had been robbed by Michael Vanstone. Sellingall her jewellery and dresses she managed to secure two hundred poundsand with this sum in her pocket she secretly left home. The theatricalmanager who had offered her an engagement should she ever require ithad moved to York and it was to that city that Magdalen hastened.Her absence was at once discovered and Miss Garth resorted to everypossible means of tracing her to her destination. A reward of fiftypounds was offered and her mode of procedure being suspected handbillssetting forth her appearance were posted in York. It was one of thesebills that attracted the attention of a certain Captain Wragge.Captain Wragge was the stepson of Mrs. Vanstone's mother and hadpersisted in regarding himself as a member of her family and havingknown of the real relationship that existed between his half-sister andMr. Andrew Vanstone had obtained from the latter a small annual subsidyas the price of his silence. A confessed rogue the captain imagined hesaw in this handbill an opportunity of re-stocking his exhaustedexchequer.As he wandered on the walls of York pondering how he should act he metMagdalen herself and at once greeted her as a relative. The girl wouldhave avoided him but on his pointing out that unless she placed herselfunder his protection she was bound to be discovered and taken back toher friends she consented to accompany him to his lodgings. There heintroduced her to his wife a tall gaunt woman with a largegood-natured vacant face who lived in a state of bemused terror of herhusband who bullied and dragooned her according to his mood.After listening to the frank exposition of his character and his methodof living Magdalen decided to accept Captain Wragge's assistance. Oncertain terms Wragge agreed to train her for the stage and secure herengagements taking a half share of any money she might earn. In returnfor these profits he agreed to carry out certain inquiries whenever shemight think it necessary. As to the nature of these inquiries she forthe time being preserved silence.Magdalen's talent for acting proved highly successful and under thedirection of the captain she began rapidly to make a reputation forherself and at the end of six months she had saved between six andseven hundred pounds. She now decided that it was time to put her planof retribution into execution.At her instructions Captain Wragge had discovered that Michael Vanstonewas dead and that his son Noel Vanstone had succeeded to the propertyand was now living with his father's old housekeeper a certain Swisslady the widow of a professor of science by name Mrs. Lecount inVauxhall Walk Lambeth. The remaining information that Wragge obtainedregarding the Vanstones was to the effect that the deceased Michael hada great friend in Admiral Bartram whose nephew George was the son ofMr. Andrew Vanstone's sister and therefore the cousin of Noel Vanstone.Having this information Magdalen calmly informed Wragge that theiralliance for the moment was at an end and taking Mrs. Wragge withher journeyed to London. There she obtained rooms directly opposite thehouse occupied by Noel Vanstone. Disguising herself as Miss Garth andassuming her old governess's voice and manner she boldly visited the
comment343,house. She found Noel Vanstone a weak avaricious coward who wasalready terrified by the letters she had written him demanding therestitution of her fortune. He was completely at the mercy of Mrs.Lecount.Something about the supposed Miss Garth excited the suspicion of Mrs.Lecount and she deliberately set about to try and make her visitorbetray what she was convinced she was concealing."I would suggest" said Mrs. Lecount "that you give a hundred pounds toeach of these unfortunate sisters.""He will repent the insult to the last hour of his life" said Magdalen.The instant that answer passed her lips she would have given worlds torecall it. Her passionate words had been uttered in her own voice. Mrs.Lecount detected the change and with a view to establishing some proofof the identity of her visitor she secured by a subterfuge a thinstrip of the old-fashioned skirt which Magdalen was wearing in thecharacter of Miss Garth.Foiled in her appeal to Noel Vanstone Magdalen determined to put intrain the plot she had long proposed to herself. She set outdeliberately to win the property of which she and her sister had beendespoiled by winning the hand of Noel Vanstone. A letter from FrankClare had released her from her engagement and with a bitter heart shewent down to Aldborough in Suffolk whither Noel Vanstone had removedfor his health.In the character of the niece of Mr. Bygrave which role Captain Wraggeadopted she laid siege to the selfish affections of Noel Vanstone. Hertask proved ridiculously easy. Noel fell hopelessly in love with herand before many days were out proposed marriage. So far everything hadworked smoothly but at this point Mrs. Lecount's fears were aroused.She determined to prevent the marriage at all costs and used everypossible means to dissuade her master from having anything more to dowith the Bygraves and the whole plot must have fallen to the ground hadit not been for the persistence and skilful diplomacy displayed byCaptain Wragge.He arranged that Noel should visit Admiral Bartram leaving Mrs. Lecountbehind to pack up. From Admiral Bartram's he was to proceed to Londonwhere he would be duly united to Magdalen. In order to secure thenon-interference of Mrs. Lecount the captain sent her a forged lettersummoning her at once to the death-bed of her brother at Zurich. ButMrs. Lecount was not so easily disposed of as Captain Wragge hadimagined.As soon as her master departed for Admiral Bartram's she took theopportunity when both Magdalen and the captain were out to visit theirhouse. Readily persuading the simple-minded Mrs. Wragge who had apassion for clothes to show her Magdalen's wardrobe she discoveredthere the skirt from which she had cut a piece on the occasion of thegirl's visit in the character of Miss Garth.She was detected by Captain Wragge leaving the house but careless ofwhat the latter might think she returned home in triumph. There shefound the letter summoning her to Zurich. There was no time to be lostshe had to go. But before she set out she wrote a letter to NoelVanstone disclosing the whole facts of the conspiracy.Captain Wragge positive in his own mind that Mrs. Lecount haddiscovered everything would have consulted Magdalen but the girl wasin a condition which prevented her from taking any active part in theaffair. She wandered about Aldborough with a settled despair written
comment344,clearly on the beautiful features of her face. Her woe-begone appearanceattracted the attention of a certain Captain Kirke and he carried awaywith him on his ship the indelible memory of her beauty.Captain Wragge had to depend solely on his own exertions. Waiting tillthe housekeeper had left Aldborough he discovered by inquiries at thepost-office that Mrs. Lecount had written to Noel Vanstone. That lettermust be stopped at all costs and the captain acted boldly. The day wasSaturday. Obtaining a special licence he hurried off to AdmiralBartram's before Mrs. Lecount's letter was delivered and induced NoelVanstone to accompany him to London. At the same time he left behind himseveral envelopes addressed to "Captain Wragge" under cover of whichAdmiral Bartram was to forward all correspondence which might arriveafter his departure. By this means Mrs. Lecount's letter was preventedfrom coming into the hands of her master and two days later Magdalenduly became the wife of Noel Vanstone.Twelve weeks later Noel Vanstone walked moodily about the garden of acottage he had taken in the Highlands. That morning Magdalen withouteven asking his permission had set out for London to see her sisterand her husband his health greatly enfeebled was left alone weak andmiserable. He had a habit of mourning over himself and as he restedlooking over a fence he sighed bitterly."You were happier with me" said a voice at his side.He turned with a scream to see Mrs. Lecount. She told him how his wifewas Magdalen Vanstone how she had married him simply from a desire torecover the fortune of which she had been robbed by Michael Vanstonealso suggesting that Magdalen intended to attempt his life.Shivering with terror Noel Vanstone became like wax in Mrs. Lecount'shands. He at once agreed to draw up a new will at her dictationcompletely cutting off his wife. He bequeathed Mrs. Lecount 5000 anddeclared that he wished to leave the remainder to his cousin GeorgeBartram. Such an arrangement however Mrs. Lecount foresaw might befraught with those very dangers which she wished to avoid. GeorgeBartram was young and susceptible. It was conceivable that Magdalenrobbed of the stake for which she had so boldly played might on herhusband's death attempt to secure the prize by luring George Bartraminto a marriage. At the instigation of his housekeeper Noel Vanstonetherefore bequeathed the residue of his estate absolutely to AdmiralBartram. But this will was coupled with a letter addressed to theadmiral secretly entrusting him to make the estate over to George undercertain circumstances. He was to be married to or to marry within sixmonths a woman who was not a widow. In the event of his not complyingwith these conditions which would prevent his marriage with Magdalenthe money was to go to his married sister.Having outwitted Magdalen Mrs. Lecount's next object was to remove NoelVanstone down to London. In order that he might be strong enough totravel Mrs. Lecount prepared a favourite posset for him. Returning withthe fragrant mixture she noticed him sitting at a table his headresting on his hand apparently asleep."Your drink Mr. Noel" she said touching him. He took no notice. Shelooked at him closer Noel Vanstone was dead._III.--The Darkest Hour_In pursuance of her determination to discover the secret trust Magdalensecured a position as parlourmaid in Admiral Bartram's house. For daysshe waited for an opportunity of examining the admiral's papers. Atnight the admiral who was addicted to sleep-walking was guarded by adrunken old sea-dog called Mazey and in the daytime she could do
comment345,nothing without being detected.The secret trust lay heavily on the admiral's mind and it became themore unbearable when George Bartram came down and announced hisintention of marrying Norah Vanstone. George's married sister was deadand thus one of the two objects contemplated by the secret trust hadfailed and only a fortnight remained before the expiry of six months inwhich George Bartram had to marry in order to inherit the fortune. Theadmiral objected to the marriage with Norah Vanstone but was at a losshow to dissuade George from the match.While this problem was occupying the admiral's attention Magdalen atlast found the chance of examining her master's private apartments.Mazey under the influence of drink had deserted his post and with abasket of keys in her hands Magdalen crept into the room where theadmiral kept his papers. Drawer after drawer she opened but nowherecould she find the secret trust.Suddenly she heard a footstep and turning round quickly she saw comingtowards her in the moonlight the figure of Admiral Bartram. Transfixedwith terror she watched him coming nearer and nearer. He did not seemto see her and as he almost brushed past her she heard him exclaim"Noel I don't know where it's safe. I don't know where to put it. Takeit back Noel."Magdalen realising that the admiral was walking in his sleep followedhim closely. He went to a drawer in a cabinet and took out a foldedletter and putting it down before him on the table repeatedmechanically "Take it back Noel--take it back"Looking over his shoulder Magdalen saw that the paper was the secrettrust. She watched the admiral replace it in another cabinet and thenwalk back silently to his bed. In another moment she had takenpossession of the letter when a hand was suddenly laid on her wristand the voice of old Mazey exclaimed "Drop it Jezebel--drop it"Dragging her away old Mazey locked her in her room for the night butearly the following morning relented and allowed her to leave thehouse.Three weeks later Admiral Bartram died and though Magdalen instructedher solicitors to set up the secret trust and though the house wassearched from top to bottom the letter could not be found. Inconsequence the property passed to George Bartram who two monthslater married Norah Vanstone.Magdalen gave up the struggle in despair and not daring to return toher people sunk lower and lower until she reached the depths ofpoverty. At last in a wretched quarter in the East End she came to theend of her resources. Ill and almost dying the people from whom sherented her one miserable room determined to send her to the workhouse. Acrowd collected to watch her departure. She was just about to be carriedto a cab when a man pushed his way through the crowd and saw her face.That man was Captain Kirke who had seen her at Aldborough. He at oncegave instructions for her to be taken back into the house paid a sumdown for her proper treatment and secured the services of a doctor anda nurse. Every day he came to inquire after her and when at last afterweeks of suffering her strength returned it was he who brought Norahand Miss Garth to her.After the long separation the two sisters had much to tell one another.Norah who had bowed patiently under her misfortunes had achieved thevery object for which Magdalen had schemed in vain. She had obtained
comment346,through her marriage with George Bartram the fortune which her fatherhad intended for her. Among other things which she related to Magdalenwas the account of how she had discovered the secret trust simply bychance. By the discovery of this document Magdalen became entitled tohalf her late husband's fortune for the secret trust having failedthe law had distributed the estate between the deceased's next ofkin--half to Magdalen and half to George Bartram. Taking the paper fromher sister's hands Magdalen tore it into pieces."This paper alone gives me the fortune which I obtained by marrying NoelVanstone" she said. "I will owe nothing to my past life. I part with itas I part with these torn morsels of paper."                                   To Captain Kirke Magdalen wrote the complete story of all she had done.She felt it was due to him that he should know all. She awaited theinevitable result--the inevitable separation from the man she had grownto love. When he had read it he came to her.Near to tears she waited to hear her fate."Tell me what you think of me Tell me the truth" she said."With my own lips" he asked."Yes" she answered. "Say what you think of me with your own lips."She looked up at him for the first time and then he stooped and kissedher.                                   The Woman in White      Wilkie Collins' greatest success was achieved on the     appearance of "The Woman in White" in 1860 a story described     by Thackeray as "thrilling." The book attracted immediate     attention Collins' method of unravelling an intricate plot by     a succession of narratives being distinctly novel and     appealing immensely to the reading public._I.--The Woman Appears__The story here presented will be told by several pens. Let WalterHartright teacher of drawing aged twenty-eight be heard first_.I had once saved Professor Pesca from drowning and in his desire to do"a good something for Walter" the warm-hearted little Italian securedme the position of art-master at Limmeridge House Cumberland.It was the night before my departure to take up my duties as teacher toMiss Laura Fairlie and her half-sister Miss Marian Halcombe andgeneral assistant to Frederick Fairlie uncle and guardian to MissFairlie. Having bidden good-bye to my mother and sister at their cottagein Hampstead I decided to walk home to my chambers the longest possibleway round. In the after-warmth of the hot July day I made my way acrossthe darkened Heath. Suddenly I was startled by a hand laid lightly on myshoulder. I turned to see the figure of a solitary woman with acolourless youthful face dressed from head to foot in white garments."Is that the road to London" she said.Her sudden appearance her extraordinary dress and the strained tonesof her voice so surprised me that I hesitated some moments beforereplying. Her agitation at my silence was distressing and calming heras well as I could and promising to help her to get a cab I asked hera few questions. Her answers showed that she was suffering from someterrible nervous excitement. She asked me if I knew any baronet--anyfrom Hampshire--and seemed almost absurdly relieved when I assured her Idid not. In the course of our conversation as we walked towards St.John's Wood I discovered a curious circumstance. She knew LimmeridgeHouse and the FairliesHaving found her a cab I bade her good-bye. As we parted she suddenly
comment347,seized my hand and kissed it with overwhelming gratitude. Her conveyancewas hardly out of sight when two men drove past in an open chaise anddrawing up in front of a policeman asked him if he had seen a woman inwhite promising a reward if he caught her."What has she done" queried the policeman."Done" exclaimed one of the men. "She has escaped from our asylum."The day following this strange adventure I arrived at Limmeridge Houseand the next morning made the acquaintance of the household. MarianHalcombe and Laura Fairlie her half-sister were in point ofappearance the exact reverse of each other. The former was a tallmasculine-looking woman with a masculine capacity for deep friendship.The latter was made in a slighter mould with charming delicatefeatures set off by a mass of pale-brown hair. Mr. Frederick Fairlie Ifound to be a neurotic utterly selfish gentleman who passed his lifein his own apartments amusing himself with bullying his valetexamining his works of art and talking of his nerves.With the other members of the household I soon became on a friendlyfooting. Miss Halcombe when I told her of my strange adventure onHampstead Heath turned up her mother's correspondence with her secondhusband and discovered there a reference to the woman in white whobore a striking resemblance to Miss Fairlie. Her name was AnneCatherick. She had stayed for a short time in the neighbourhood with hermother and had been befriended by Mrs. Fairlie.As the months went by I fell passionately and hopelessly in love withLaura Fairlie. No word of love however passed between us but MissHalcombe realising the situation broke to me gently the fact that mylove was hopeless. Almost from childhood Laura had been engaged to SirPercival Clyde a Hampshire baronet and her marriage was due to takeplace shortly. I accepted the inevitable and decided to resign myposition. But before I set out from Limmeridge House many strangethings happened.Shortly before the arrival of Sir Percival Clyde to settle the detailsof his marriage Laura had an anonymous letter warning her against theunion and concluding with the words "your mother's daughter has atender place in my heart for your mother was my first my best my onlyfriend." Two days after the receipt of this letter I came upon AnneCatherick busily tending the grave of Mrs. Fairlie. With difficulty Ipersuaded her to tell me something of her story. That she had beenlocked up in an asylum--unjustly it was clear--I already knew. Sheconfessed to having written the letter to Laura but when I mentionedthe name of Sir Percival Glyde she shrieked aloud with terror. It wasobvious that it was the baronet who had placed her under restraint.
comment348,The Fairlies' family solicitor Mr. Gilmore arriving next day thewhole matter was placed before him. He decided to send the anonymousletter to Sir Percival Glyde's solicitors and to ask for an explanation.Before any reply was received I had left Limmeridge House biddingfarewell to the place where I had spent so many happy hours and to thegirl I loved._II.--The Story Continued by Vincent Gilmore of Chancery LaneSolicitor to the Fairlies_I write these lines at the request of my friend Mr. Walter Hartrightto describe the events which took place after his departure fromLimmeridge House.My letter to Sir Percival Glyde's solicitors regarding Anne Catherick'sanonymous communication was answered by the baronet in person on hisarrival at Limmeridge House. He was the first to offer an explanation.Anne Catherick was the daughter of one of his old family servants andin consideration of her mother's past services he had sent her to aprivate asylum instead of allowing her to go to one of the publicestablishments where her mental condition would otherwise have compelledher to remain. Her animus against Sir Percival was due to the fact thatshe had discovered that he was the cause of her incarceration. Theanonymous letter was evidence of this insane antipathy.My next concern with this history deals with the drawing up of MissFairlie's marriage settlement. Besides being heiress to the Limmeridgeproperty Miss Fairlie had personal estate to the value of 20000derived under the will of her father Philip Fairlie. To this she becameentitled on completing her twenty-first year. She had a life interestmoreover in 10000 which on her death passed to her father's sisterEleanor the wife of Count Fosco an Italian nobleman. In all humanprobability the Countess Fosco would never enjoy this money for she waswell advanced in age while Laura was not yet twenty-one.Regarding the 20000 the proper and fair course was that the wholeamount should be settled so as to give the income to the lady for herlife afterwards to Sir Percival for his life and the principal to thechildren of the marriage. In default of issue the principal was to bedisposed of as the lady might by her will direct thus enabling her tomake provision for her half-sister Marian Halcombe. This was the fairand proper settlement but Sir Percival's solicitors insisted that theprincipal should go to Sir Percival Glyde in the event of his survivingLady Glyde and there being no issue. I protested in vain and thisiniquitous settlement which placed every farthing of the 20000 in SirPercival's pocket and prevented Miss Fairlie providing for MissHalcombe was duly signed._III.--The Story Continued by Marian Halcombe in a Series of Extractsfrom Her Diary__Limmeridge House November 9_. I have secured for poor Walter Hartrighta position as draughtsman on an expedition which is to start immediatelyfor central South America. Change of scene may really be the salvationof him at this crisis in his life. To-day poor Laura asked Sir Percivalto release her from the engagement."If you still persist in maintaining our engagement" she said lookingirresistibly beautiful "I may be your true and faithful wife SirPercival--your loving wife if I know my own heart never"
comment349,"I gratefully accept your grace and truth" he said. "The least that_you_ can offer is more to me than the utmost that I can hope for fromany other woman in the world."_December_ 19. I received Sir Percival's consent to live with him ascompanion to his wife in their new home in Hampshire. I was interestedto discover that Count Fosco the husband of Laura's Aunt Eleanor is agreat friend of Sir Percival's._December 22_ 11 _o'clock._ It is all over. They are married._Black-water Park Hampshire June_ 11. Six long months have elapsedsince Laura and I last saw each other. I have just arrived at her newhome. My latest news of Walter Hartright is derived from an Americanpaper. It describes how the expedition was last seen entering a wildprimeval forest._June_ 15. Laura has returned and I have found her changed. Theold-time freshness and softness have gone. She is if anything morebeautiful. She refused to go into details on the subject of her marriedlife and the fact that we have this forbidden topic seems to make adifference to our old relations. Sir Percival made no pretence to beglad to see me. They brought two guests with them Count Fosco and hiswife Laura's aunt. He is immensely fat with a face like that of thegreat Napoleon and eyes which have an extraordinary power. In spite ofhis size he treads as softly as a cat. His manners are perfect. Henever says a hard word to his wife but none the less he rules herwith a rod of iron. She is absolutely his slave obedient to theslightest expression of his eyes. He manages Sir Percival as he manageshis wife and indeed all of us. He inquired to-day whether there wereany Italian gentlemen in the neighbourhood._June 16_. Merriman Sir Percival's solicitor came down to-day and Iaccidentally overheard a conversation which seems to indicate adetermination on Sir Percival's part to raise money on Laura's securityto pay off some of his heavy debts._June 17_. Sir Percival tried to make Laura sign the document which hadbeen brought down by Merriman. On my advice she refused to do sowithout reading it. A terrible scene resulted which was only stopped bythe intervention of Count Fosco. Sir Percival swore that Laura shallsign it to-morrow. To-night Laura and I fancied we saw a white figurein the wood._June 18_. Laura has met Anne Catherick. It was she we saw in the wood
comment350,last night. She came upon Laura in the boat-house and declared she hadsomething to tell her. "What is it you have to tell me" asked Laura."The secret that your cruel husband is afraid of" she answered. "I oncethreatened him with the secret and frightened him. You shall threatenhim with the secret and frighten him too." When Laura pressed her shedeclared somebody was watching them and pushing Laura back into theboat-house disappeared._June 19_. The worst has come. Sir Percival has discovered a messagefrom Anne Catherick to Laura promising to reveal the secret andstating that yesterday she was followed by a "tall fat man" clearlythe count. Sir Percival was furious and locked Laura up in her bedroom.Again the count has had to intervene on her behalf._Later_.--By climbing out on the roof of the verandah I have overhearda conversation between the count and Sir Percival. They spoke withcomplete frankness--with fiendish frankness--to one another. Foscopointed out that his friend was desperately in need of money and thatas Laura had refused to sign the document he could not secure it byordinary means. If Laura died Sir Percival would inherit 20000 andFosco himself obtain through his wife 10000. Sir Percival confessedthat Anne Catherick had a secret which endangered his position. Thissecret he surmised she had told to Laura and Laura being in lovewith Walter Hartright--he had discovered this--would use it. The countinquired what Anne Catherick was like."Fancy my wife after a bad illness with a touch of something wrong inher head and there is Anne Catherick for you" answered Sir Percival."What are you laughing about""Make your mind easy Percival" he said. "I have my projects here in mybig head. Sleep my son the sleep of the just."I crept back to my room soaked through with the rain. Oh my God am Igoing to be ill I have heard the clock strike every hour. It is socold so cold and the strokes of the clock--the strokes I can'tcount--keep striking in my head....[At this point the diary ceases to be legible.]_IV.--The Story Completed by Walter Hartright on His Return fromSeveral Manuscripts_The events that happened after Marian Halcombe fell ill while I wasstill absent in South America I will relate briefly.Count Fosco discovered Anne Catherick and immediately took steps to putinto execution the plot he had hinted at. Wearing the clothes of LadyGlyde the unfortunate girl was taken to a house in St. John's Woodwhere the real Lady Glyde was expected to stay when passing through townon her way to Cumberland. Lady Glyde on pretence that her half-sisterhad been removed to town was induced to visit London where she was met
comment351,by Count Fosco and at once placed in a private asylum in the name ofAnne Catherick. Her statement that she was Lady Glyde was held to beproof of the unsoundness of her mind. Unfortunately for the count'splans the real Anne Catherick died the day before the incarceration ofLady Glyde but as there was no one to prove the dates of these eventsboth Fosco and Sir Percival regarded themselves as secure. With greatpomp the body of Anne Catherick was taken to Limmeridge and buried inthe name of Lady Glyde.As soon as Marian Halcombe recovered the supposed death of herhalf-sister was broken to her. Recollecting the conversation she hadoverheard just before she was taken ill she had grave suspicions as tothe cause of Laura's death and immediately instituted inquiries. In thepursuit of these inquiries she visited Anne Catherick in the asylum andher joy in discovering Laura there instead of the supposed AnneCatherick was almost overwhelming. By bribing one of the nurses shesecured Laura's freedom and travelled with her to Limmeridge toestablish her identity. To her disgust and amazement Frederick Fairlierefused to accept her statement or to believe that Laura was other thanAnne Catherick. Count Fosco had visited and prepared him.At this juncture I returned from South America and hearing of thedeath of the girl I loved at once set off to Limmeridge on a sadpilgrimage to her grave. While I was reading the tragic narrative on thetombstone two women approached. Even as the words "Sacred to thememory of Laura Lady Glyde" swam before my eyes one of them liftedher veil. It was Laura.In a poor quarter of London I took up my abode with Laura and MissHalcombe and while my poor Laura slowly recovered her health andspirits I devoted myself to the support of the little household and tounravelling the mystery which surrounded the events I have hererecorded. From Mrs. Clements who had befriended poor Anne Catherick Ilearnt that Mrs. Catherick had had secret meetings years before with SirPercival Glyde in the vestry of the church at Welmingham.To establish the exact relations between Mrs. Catherick and SirPercival I visited Welmingham pursued by the baronet's agents. Myinterview with Mrs. Catherick satisfied me that Sir Percival was not thefather of Anne and that their secret meeting in the vestry hadreference to some object other than romance. The contemptuous way inwhich Mrs. Catherick spoke of Sir Percival's mother set me thinking. Ivisited the vestry where the meetings had taken place and examining theregister discovered at the bottom of one of the pages compressed intoa very small space the entry of Sir Felix Glyde's marriage with themother of Sir Percival. Hearing from the sexton that an old lawyer inthe neighbouring town had a copy of this register I visited him andfound that his copy did not contain the entry of this marriage.Here was the secret at last Sir Percival was the illegitimate son ofhis father and had forged this entry of his father's marriage in orderto secure the title and estates. Mrs. Catherick was the only person whoknew of the plot. In a fit of ill-temper she had told her daughter Annethat she possessed a secret that could ruin the baronet. Anne herselfnever knew the secret but foolishly repeated her mother's words to SirPercival and the price of her temerity was incarceration in a privateasylum.I returned post-haste to Welmingham to secure a copy of the forgedentry. It was night. As I approached the church a man stopped memistaking me for Sir Percival Glyde. A light in the vestry showed to methat Sir Percival had anticipated my discovery and had secretly visitedthe church for the purpose of destroying the evidences of his crime. Buta terrible fate awaited him. Even as I approached the church a huge
comment352,tongue of flame shot up into the night sky. As I rushed forward I couldhear the baronet vainly seeking to escape from the vestry. The lock washampered and he could not get out. I tried to force an entry but bythe time the flames were under control the end had come. We found thecharred remains of the man who had walked through life as Sir PercivalClyde lying by the door.The mystery was now unravelled and I was free to marry my darling. Theonly other point that seemed to need clearing up was the parentage ofthe unfortunate Anne Catherick. That was elucidated by Mrs. Catherickherself. The father of Anne was Philip Fairlie the father of Laura--afact that accounted for the extraordinary likeness between the twogirls. But though our tribulations seemed to be at an end we had yet toestablish the identity of Laura and to deal with Count Fosco.To Miss Halcombe the count had written a letter expressive of hisadmiration and begging her for her own sake to let matters be. I knewthe count was a dangerous enemy who would not hesitate to employ murderif necessary to gain his ends but I was determined to re-establish theidentity of Laura. Miss Halcombe's journal afforded me a clue. I foundthere a statement that on the occasion of his first visit to Black-waterPark the count had been very concerned to know whether there were anyItalians in the neighbourhood. Without hoping that anything would resultfrom the manoeuvre I followed the count one night in the company of myfriend Professor Pesca to the theatre. The professor did not recogniseFosco but when the count staring round the theatre focussed hisglasses on Pesca I saw a look of unmistakable terror come over hiscountenance. He at once rose from his seat and left the place. Wefollowed.The professor was very grave and it was quite a different man to thelight-hearted little Italian that I knew who related to me a strangechapter in his life. As a young man Pesca had belonged to a secretsociety for the removal of tyrants. He was still a member of thesociety and could be called upon to act at any time. The count had alsobeen a member of the society and had betrayed its secret. Hence histerror of seeing Pesca.I immediately made use of the weapon that had been placed in my hand. Iwent boldly to Fosco's house and offered to effect his escape fromEngland in return for a full confession of his share in the abduction ofLady Glyde. He threatened to kill me but realising that I had him at mymercy consented to my terms.This confession completely established the identity of Laura and she waspublicly acknowledged by Mr. Frederick Fairlie. Laura and I had beenmarried some time before and we were now able to set off on ourhoneymoon. We visited Paris. While there I chanced to be attracted by alarge crowd that surged round the doors of the Morgue. Forcing my waythrough I saw lying within the body of Count Fosco. There was a woundexactly over his heart and on his arm were two deep cuts in the shapeof the letter "T"--the symbol of his treason to the secret brotherhood.When we returned to England we lived comfortably on the income I wasable to earn by my profession. A son was born to us and when FrederickFairlie died it was Marion Halcombe who had been the good angel of ourlives who announced the important change that had taken place in our
comment353,prospects."Let me make two eminent personages known to one another" sheexclaimed with all her easy gaiety of old times holding out my son tome "Mr. Walter Hartright--the heir of Limmeridge House."                                   HUGH CONWAYCalled Back      Hugh Conway the English novelist whose real name was     Frederick John Fargus was born December 26 1847 the son of     a Bristol auctioneer. His early ambition was to lead a     seafaring life and with this object he entered the school     frigate Conway--from which he took his pseudonym--then     stationed on the Mersey. His father was against the project     with the result that Conway abandoned the idea and entered his     parent's office where he found ample leisure to employ     himself in writing occasional newspaper articles and tales.     His first published work was a volume of poems which appeared     in 1879 and achieved a moderate success. But Hugh Conway is     chiefly known to the reading public for his famous story     "Called Black." The work was submitted to a number of     publishers before it was finally accepted and published in     1884. Attracting little notice at first it eventually made a     hit and within five years 350000 copies were sold. Several     other works appeared from Conway's pen in rapid succession     but none of them attained the popularity of "Called Back."     Hugh Conway died at Monte Carlo on May 15 1885._I.--A Blind Witness_I was young rich and possessed of unusual vigour and strength. Lifeyou would think should have been very pleasant to me. I was beyond thereach of care I was as free as the wind to follow my own devices. Butin spite of all these advantages I was as helpless and miserable as thepoorest toiler in the country.For I was blind stone blindThe dread disease that robbed me of my sight had crept on me slowlythrough the years and now I lay in my bedroom in Walpole Street withmy old nurse Priscilla Drew sleeping on an extemporised bed outside mydoor to tend and care for me.It was a stifling night in August. I could not sleep. Despair filled myheart. I was blind blind blind I should be blind for ever Soentirely had I lost heart that I began to think I would not haveperformed at all the operation which the doctors said might give me backthe use of my eyes.Presently a sudden fierce longing to be out of doors came over me. Itwas night very few people would be about. Old Priscilla slept soundly.I rose from my bed and dressing myself with difficulty creptcautious as a thief to the street door. The street a quiet one was
comment354,deserted. For a time I walked backwards and forwards up the street. Theexercise filled me with a peculiar elation. By carefully counting myfootsteps I gauged accurately the position of my house. At last Idecided to return and opening the door I entered and climbed thestairs. The atmosphere of the place struck me as strange and unfamiliar.I felt for a bracket which should have been upon the wall that I hadoften been warned to avoid knocking with my head. It was not there. Ihad entered the wrong house.As I turned to grope my way back I heard the murmur of voices. I mademy way in the direction of these sounds to seek for assistance.Suddenly there fell upon my ears the notes of a piano and a woman'svoice singing.Music with me was an absorbing passion. I listened enthralled placingmy ear close to the door from behind which the sound proceeded. It was asong that few amateurs would dare to attempt and I waited eagerly tohear how the beautiful voice would render the finale. But I never heardthat last movement.Instead of the soft sweet liquid notes of passionate love there was aspasmodic fearful gasp succeeded by a long deep groan. The musicstopped abruptly and the piercing cry of a woman rang out. I threw openthe door and rushed headlong into the room. I heard an oath anexclamation of surprise and the muffled cry of the woman. I turned inthe direction of that faint cry. My foot caught in something and I fellprostrate on the body of a man. Before I could rise a strong handgripped my throat and I heard the sharp click of a pistol lock."Spare me" I cried. "I am blind blind blind"I lay perfectly still crying out these words again and again.A strong light was turned on my eyes. There was no sound in the roomsave the muffled cry of the woman. The hands at my throat were releasedand I was ordered to stand up. Some elementary tests of my blindnesswere tried and I was told to give an account of my presence in thehouse. My story seemed to satisfy the man who questioned me. I wasbidden to sit in a chair. I could hear the sound of men carrying a heavyburden out of the room. Then the woman's moans ceased. A voice at myside bade me drink something out of a glass enforcing the demand with apistol at my temple. A heavy drowsiness came over me and I sank intounconsciousness.When I came to myself I was in my own bed in my own room having beenfound apparently in a state of helpless intoxication lying in a street
comment355,some distance from where I lived._II.--Not for Love or Marriage_Two years elapsed. The operation had given me back the use of my eyes. Iwas in the city of Turin with a friend. The sight of a beautiful facelured my companion and myself into the cathedral of San Giovanni. It wasthe face of a young girl of about twenty-two a face of entrancingbeauty. Seated with my friend I watched her until she rose and leftwith her companion an old Italian woman. For a moment I caught a lookof her dark glorious eyes as she mechanically crossed herself with holywater. There was a dreamy far-away look in them a look that seemed topass over one and see what was behind the object gazed at.We followed her out of the cathedral and saw the old woman speak to amiddle-aged round-shouldered bespectacled man of gentlemanlyappearance."Do English gentlemen stare at their own countrywomen in public placeslike this" said a voice at our elbows.I turned to see a tall man of about thirty standing just behind us. Hisface with its heavy moustache sneering mouth and darkened sulleneyes was not a pleasant one and his impudent question annoyed me. Myfriend with a few sharp retorts delivered to him a crushing snub andthe man turned away scowling. We saw him cross the road to themiddle-aged man who had been speaking to the old Italian woman and hercharge. And then we too went our way.The girl's face haunted me but we never saw her again in the city ofTurin.Some weeks later when I was wandering through London I suddenly cameupon her in the company of her old nurse. I tracked her to her lodgingsand there engaged rooms myself. An accident to the nurse whose name Idiscovered was Theresa gave me an opportunity of introducing myself.The girl spoke to me but her voice and her manner was strangelyapathetic. She seemed never to know me unless I spoke to her and thenunless I asked questions our conversation died a natural death. To makelove to her seemed impossible and yet I loved her passionately.At last by aid of bribes I managed to secure the qualified assistanceof Theresa. She promised to place my proposals before the girl'sguardian. Of Pauline herself--such was the girl's name--Theresa wouldsay nothing. When I asked her if she thought the girl cared for me shereplied mysteriously and enigmatically."Who knows I do not know--but I tell you the _signorina_ is not forlove or marriage."Theresa fulfilled her part of the bargain and I received a visit fromthe middle-aged man I had seen in Turin. His name was Manuel Ceneri. Hissister had married Pauline's father an Englishman March by name. Heconsented readily to my marriage with Pauline on one condition. I was to
comment356,ask no questions seek to know nothing of her birth and family nothingof her early days.Pauline was called into the room. I took her hand. I asked her to be mywife."Yes if you wish it" she replied softly without even changing colour.She did not repulse me but she did not respond to my affection. Sheremained as calm and undemonstrative as ever.At Dr. Ceneri's strange urgency Pauline and I were married two dayslater._III.--Calling Back the Past_"Not for love or marriage"I learned all too soon the meaning of Theresa's words. Pauline my wifemy love had no past. Slowly at first then with swift steps the truthcame home to me. The face of the woman I had married was fair as themorn her figure as perfect as that of a Grecian statue her voice lowand sweet but the one thing which animates every charm--the mind--wasmissing. Memory except for the events of the moment before she hadnone. Of all emotion she was incapable. She was sweet and docile buther whole existence was a negative one. Such was Pauline my wife.When I was convinced of the truth I placed her in charge of Priscillaand hastened to Geneva to seek an explanation from Ceneri. I shouldnever have found the doctor had not chance thrown me in the way of thevery Italian we had met outside the cathedral of San Giovanni. Knowingthat he knew Ceneri I spoke to him. At first he refused to haveanything to do with me but when I mentioned Pauline's name he asked mewhat concern I had with her."She is my wife" I replied."Your wife" he shouted. "You lie"I rose furiously and bade him choose his words more carefully. After afew moments he apologised asking me whether Ceneri knew of ourmarriage. "Traditore" I heard him whisper fiercely to himself when Ireplied in the affirmative.After some further remarks he consented to take me to Dr. Ceneritelling me that his name was Macari. My interview with the doctor wassomewhat unsatisfactory. Pauline had had a shock but the nature of thatshock he refused to disclose. Macari before her illness had imaginedhimself in love with her and was furious at my marriage. One thinghowever the doctor told me just as I left which partially explainedhis consent to our union. He had been her guardian and the fortune of50000 to which she was entitled he had spent in the cause of Italianfreedom. Though he had betrayed his trust he considered the causejustified the act but he had been glad none the less to make her somecompensation by marrying her to a wealthy Englishman.When I left Dr. Ceneri I met Macari lurking outside. He declared that
comment357,in a few weeks he would come to England and explain much that Ceneri hadleft unsaid.Several months later he kept his promise. Ceneri he told me had beenarrested in St. Petersburg for participation in some anarchist plot andwas on his way to Siberia. Of his own personal history he discoursed atlength. His name it appeared was really March and he was Pauline'sbrother. In common with his sister he had been robbed by Ceneri of hisfortune.He asked to see his sister but when they met Pauline showed norecollection of him. He called often and she watched him I noticedwith an eager troubled look. One night after dinner as he describedhow in a battle he had killed a white-coated Austrian he seized aknife from the table and illustrated the downward blow with which hehad saved his own life. I heard a deep sigh behind me and turning Isaw Pauline in a dead faint. I carried her to her room. When she came toherself again or rather when she rose in her bed and turned her face tomine I saw in her eyes what by the mercy of God I shall never againsee there.With eyes fixed and immovable and dilated to their utmost extent sherose and passed out of the room. I followed her. Swiftly she passed outof the house into the street and without the slightest hesitationturning at right angles moved swiftly up a long straight road. Afterturning once more she stopped at a three-storeyed house. Going up to thedoor she laid her hand upon it. I tried to lead her gently away butshe resisted. What was I to do The house was an empty one. I paused.Once before my latch-key had opened a strange door. Would it open thisone I tried it. It fitted exactly.Without waiting for me Pauline ran in ahead. I shut the door. All wasdarkness. I could hear Pauline moving about on the first floor. Ifollowed her and striking a match found myself in a room withfolding-doors. It was furnished but the dust lay deep everywhere.Pauline stood in the middle of the room holding her head in her handsstriving it seemed to remember something. I entered the back room withthe candle I had found. There was a piano there. Something induced me tosit down at it and to play the first few notes of the song I had heardthat terrible night.A nervous trembling seemed to seize Pauline. She crossed the floortowards me and I made room for her at the piano. With a master hand sheplayed brilliantly the prelude of the song of which I had struck a fewvagrant notes. I waited breathlessly expecting her to sing. Suddenlyshe started wildly to her feet and uttering a wild cry of horror sankinto my arms. I laid her on a sofa close by. As I held her there astrange thing happened.The room beyond the folding-doors was lit with a brilliant light.Grouped round a table were four men. One of them was Ceneri the otherMacari. The third man was a stranger to me. These three men were lookingat a fourth man--a young man who appeared to be falling out of hischair clutching convulsively the hilt of a dagger the blade of whichhad been buried in his heart clearly by Macari who stood over him.I cannot explain this vision. I only saw it when I held Pauline's hand.When I let her hand drop the scene vanished. You may call it catalepticclairvoyant anything you will it was as I relate._IV.--Seeking the Truth in Siberia_Macari called on me the day after this strange scene to ask me about thememorial to Victor Emanuel."Before I consent to help you" I said "I must know why you murdered aman three years ago in a house in Horace Street."He sprang to his feet and grasping my arm looked intently into my eyes.I saw that he recognised me in spite of the great change that blindnessmakes in a face."Why should I deny the affair to an eye-witness To others I would denyit fast enough. Now my fine fellow my gay bridegroom my dearbrother-in-law I will tell you why I killed that man. He had insultedmy family. That man was Pauline's lover"He saw what was in my face as I rose and walked towards him."Not here" he said hastily "what good can it do here--a vulgar scufflebetween two gentlemen""Go" I cried "murderer and coward. Every word you have spoken to mehas been a lie and because you hate me you have to-day told me the
comment358,greatest lie of all."He left me with a look of malicious triumph in his face. I knew he liedbut how could I prove that he lied Only Ceneri could tell me the truth.He was in Siberia and mad as the scheme seemed thither I determinedto go to get the whole truth from his lips.I exerted all the influence I possessed. I spent money freely and witha special passport signed by the Czar himself which placed all theresources of the Russian police at my disposal I passed across Russiainto Siberia. At last after travelling thousands of miles I came upwith the gang of wretched prisoners in which the doctor was. Showing mypapers to the officer in command I was taken at once to the awfulprison-house. I had him brought to me in a private room and placedbefore him food and drink."I want to ask you some questions" I said "questions which you alonecan answer.""Ask them. You have given me an hour's release from misery. I amgrateful.""The first question I have to ask is--who and what is that man Macari"Ceneri sprang to his feet. "A traitor a traitor" he cried.It was Macari who had betrayed him. Macari was no more Anthony Marchthe brother of Pauline than I was and Pauline had never had a lover inthe sense in which Macari had used the word.Pauline was an innocent as an angel. The lie I had come so far todestroy had dissolved. There was one other question I had to ask. Whowas the man Macari had killed and what had he to do with PaulineCeneri's face turned ashen as I asked him the question. It was somemoments before he understood that I was the man who had stumbled intothe room. Then he told me all.The murdered man was Anthony March the brother of Pauline. As he hadalready confessed Ceneri had spent all the trust-money of which he wasguardian for Pauline and her brother in the cause of Italian freedom.When the young man grew up the time drew near when Ceneri must explainall and take the consequences. The evil day was delayed by providing himwith money. That money ran out. Ceneri and the two other men fearful ofthe consequences to all of them decided upon a plan to silence Anthony.He was to be lured to the house in Horace Street and to leave it as alunatic in charge of a doctor and keepers. But Macari ruined the plot.He was in love with Pauline and Anthony had spoken contemptuously ofsuch a match for his sister. A few insolent words at the house in HoraceStreet and the passionate Italian's knife had found its way into theyoung man's heart. It was Ceneri who had saved my life when I stumbledupon the scene. The third sharer in the tragedy who had drownedPauline's shrieks in a sofa cushion had since died raving mad in acell. That was the story.I hastened back to England leaving money behind me to provide a fewcomforts for the unfortunate prisoner. I went direct to the littlevillage where Pauline was staying with Priscilla. I could see that sheremembered me but as a person in a dream. I had to woo her now. Of ourmarriage she seemed to have forgotten everything. Though all the oldapathy had disappeared and her mind had once more awakened in herbeautiful body she did not remember that. I despaired at last ofwinning her and I determined to bid her good-bye forever. As I sat inthe woods with her for the last time gloom in my heart I fell into adoze. I was awakened by kisses on my cheeks. I sprang to my feet. Infront of me stood Pauline and looking into her eyes I saw that she
comment359,loved me.She had realised on my first return that I was her husband but haddetermined to find out if I loved her. As I said nothing so she too hadremained silent."Gilbert" she said "I have wept but now I smile. The past is passed.Let the love I bore my brother be buried in the greater love I give myhusband. Let us turn our backs on the dark shadows and begin our lives."Have I more to tell--one thing only. We went to Paris for our realhoneymoon. The great war was over and the Commune had just ended. Inthe company of a friend I saw some Communists led out to be shot andamong their faces I recognised Macari.                                   FENIMORE COOPERThe Last of the Mohicans      James Fenimore Cooper born in New Jersey on September 15     1789 was a hot-headed controversialist of Quaker descent     who after a restless youth partly spent at sea became the     earliest conspicuous American novelist. Apart from fiction     Cooper's principal subject was American naval history. Though     he made many enemies and lived in turmoil the novelist had a     strain of nobility in his character that is reflected     throughout his formal but manly narratives. Love interest     rarely rises in his stories beyond a mechanical     sentimentality it is the descriptions of adventure that     attract. Nowhere are Fenimore Cooper's vivid powers of     description more apparent than in "The Last of the Mohicans"     the second in order of the Leatherstocking tales. In the first     of the series "The Pioneers" the Leatherstocking is     represented as already past the prime of life and is     gradually being driven out of his beloved forests by the axe     and the smoke of the white settler. "The Last of the Mohicans"     takes the reader back before this period to a time when the     red man was in his vigour and was a power to be reckoned with     in the east of America. The third of the famous tales is "The     Prairie" in which Cooper's picturesque hero is laid in his     grave. Despite this the author resuscitates him in the two     remaining volumes--"The Pathfinder" and "The Deerslayer." Of     these five novels and as a matter of fact of all Cooper's     works "The Last of the Mohicans" is regarded as the     masterpiece. In it are to be found all the author's virtues     and few of his faults. It is certainly the most popular     having been translated into several languages. It was first     published in 1826. Cooper died at Cooperstown the family     locality on September 14. 1851._I.--Betrayed by the Redskin_It was the third year of the war between France and England in NorthAmerica. At Fort Edward where General Webb lay with five thousand menthe startling news had just been received that the French generalMontcalm was moving up the Champlain Lake with an army "numerous as theleaves on the trees" with the forest fastness of Fort William Henry ashis object.Fort William Henry was held by the veteran Scotchman Munro at the headof a regiment of regulars and a few provincials. As this force wasutterly inadequate to stem Montcalm's advance General Webb at once sentfifteen hundred men to strengthen the position. While the camp was in astate of bustle consequent on the departure of this relieving forceCaptain Duncan Hayward detached himself from the throng and conductingtwo ladies the daughters of Munro Alice and Cora to their horsesmounted another steed himself. It was his welcome duty to see that theladies reached Fort William Henry in safety. In order that they might
comment360,make the journey the more expeditiously they had obtained the servicesof a famous Indian runner known by the name of Le Renard Subtil whosenative appellation was Magua.The party had but five leagues to traverse and Magua had undertaken tolead them a short way through the forest. The girls hesitated as theyreached the point where they left the military road and had to take to anarrow and blind path amidst the dense trees and undergrowth. Theterrifying aspect of the guide and the loneliness of the route filledthem with alarm."Here then lies our way" said Duncan in a low voice. "Manifest nodistrust or you may invite the danger you appear to apprehend."Taking this hint the girls whipped up their horses and followed therunner along the dark and tangled pathway. They had not gone far whenthey heard the sounds of a horse's hoofs behind them and presentlythere dashed up to their side a singular-looking person withextraordinary long thin legs an emaciated body and an enormous head.The grotesqueness of his figure was enhanced by a sky-blue coat and asoiled vest of embossed silk embroidered with tarnished silver lace.Coming up with the party he declared his intention of accompanying themto Fort William Henry. Refusing to listen to any objection he took fromhis vest a curious musical instrument and placing it to his mouthdrew from it a high shrill sound. This done he began singing in fulland melodious tones one of the New England versions of the Psalms.Magua whispered something to Heyward and the latter turned impatientlyto David Gamut--such was the singer's name--and requested him in thename of common prudence to postpone his chant until a safer opportunity.The Indian allies of Montcalm it was known swarmed in the forest andthe object of the party was to move forward as quietly as possible.As the cavalcade pressed deeper into the wild thicket a savage facepeered out at them from between the bushes. A gleam of exultation shotacross his darkly painted lineaments as he watched his victims walkingunconsciously into the trap which Magua had prepared._II.--In the Nick of Time_Within an hour's journey of Fort Edward two men were lingering on thebanks of a small stream. One of them was a magnificent specimen of anIndian--almost naked with a terrific emblem of death painted upon hischest. The other was a European with the quick roving eye sun-tannedcheeks and rough dress of a hunter."Listen Hawk-eye" said the Indian addressing his companion "and Iwill tell you what my fathers have said and what the Mohicans havedone. We came and made this land ours and drove the Maquas who followedus into the woods with the bears. Then came the Dutch and gave mypeople the fire-water. They drank until the heavens and the earth seemedto meet. Then they parted with their land and now I that am a chiefand a Sagamore have never seen the sun shine but through the trees andhave never visited the graves of my fathers. When Uncas my son diesthere will no longer be any of the blood of the Sagamores. My boy is thelast of the Mohicans.""Uncas is here" said another voice in the same soft guttural tones."Who speaks to Uncas" At the next instant a youthful warrior passedbetween them with a noiseless tread and seated himself by the side ofhis father Chingachgook. "I have been on the trail of the Maquas wholie hid like cowards" continued Uncas.Further talk regarding their hated enemies the Maquas who acted as thespies of Montcalm was cut short by the sound of horses' feet. The three
comment361,men rose to their feet their eyes watchful and attentive and theirrifles ready for any emergency.Presently the cavalcade from Fort Edward appeared and Heywardaddressing Hawk-eye asked for information as to their whereaboutsexplaining that they had trusted to an Indian who had lost his way."An Indian lost in the woods" exclaimed the scout. "I should like tolook at the creature."Saying this he crept stealthily into the thicket. In a few moments hereturned his suspicions fully confirmed. Magua had clearly led theparty into a trap for purposes of his own and Hawk-eye at once tooksteps to secure his capture. While Heyward held the runner inconversation the scout and the two Mohicans crept silently through theundergrowth to surround him but the slight crackle of a breaking stickaroused Magua's suspicion and even as the ambush closed on him hedodged under Heyward's arms and vanished into the opposite thicket.Hawk-eye was too well acquainted with Indian ways to think of pursuingand restraining the eagerness of Heyward who would have followedMagua and would have been undoubtedly led to the place where thescalping-knives of Magua's companions awaited him the scout called acouncil of war.The position was serious in the extreme how serious was disclosed thatnight as they lay hid in a cave.Suddenly with blood-curdling yells the Maquas surrounded them. Theywere surrounded completely and to add to the terrors of theirsituation they discovered that their ammunition was exhausted. Thereseemed nothing to be done but die fighting. It was Cora who suggested analternative that Hawk-eye and the two Mohicans should make for FortWilliam Henry and procure from their father Munro enough men to takethem back in safety. It was the one desperate chance and the Mohicanstook it. Dropping silently down the river they disappeared. DuncanDavid and the two girls were left alone but not for long. As the nightdrew out a body of the Maquas swimming across the river entered thecave and made the whole party prisoners.It was Magua who directed all these operations and it was Magua whoannounced their fate to his prisoners. Alice should go back to herfather but Cora was to become his squaw in an Indian wigwam."Monster" cried Cora when this proposal was laid before her. "None buta fiend could meditate such a vengeance"Magua answered with a ghastly smile and at his command the Indiansseizing their white victims bound them to four trees. Stakes of glowingwood were prepared for their torture. Once more Magua offered thealternative of dishonour or death. Cora wavered but Alice strengthenedher resolution."No no" she cried. "Better that we die as we have lived together.""Then die" shouted Magua hurling his tomahawk at the girl's head. Itmissed her by an inch. Another savage rushed to complete the terribledeed. Maddened at the sight Duncan broke his bonds and flung himselfon the savage. He was at once overpowered. He saw a knife glisteningabove his head it was just about to descend. Suddenly there was a sharpcrack of a rifle and his assailant fell dead at his feet. At the samemoment Hawk-eye and the two Mohicans dashed into the encampment. In a
comment362,few moments the six Indians taken by surprise were killed only Magualived. He seemed to be at the mercy of Chingachgook. Already he layapparently lifeless. The Mohican rose with a yell of triumph and raisedhis knife to give the final blow. Even as he did so Magua rolled himselfover the edge of the precipice near which he lay and alighting on hisfeet leapt into the centre of a thicket of low bushes and disappeared._III.--"The Jubilee of Devils_"The party had reached William Henry only to leave it again. Montcalmasked for an interview with Munro and through Duncan who acted as thelatter's representative explained that it was hopeless to think ofholding the fort. General Webb had withdrawn the relieving force andthe English were outnumbered by about twenty to one. With chivalrouscourtesy the French general proposed that his brave enemies shouldmarch out with their arms and ammunition and all the honours of war.These conditions Munro sadly accepted. Compelled to be with his menMunro entrusted his daughters to the care of David.According to the conditions of the surrender the troops marched out.Behind them came the women and stragglers the French and their nativeallies watching them in silence. At the other side of the plain was adefile. The troops slowly entered this and disappeared. The rear-guardof civilians was now left alone on the plain. Cora as she pressedslowly onwards with her sister and David saw Magua addressing thenatives speaking with his fatal and artful eloquence. The effect of hiswords was soon seen.One of the savages attracted by the shawl in which a mother had wrappedher baby seized the child and dashed its brains out on the ground. Asthe mother sprang forward he buried his tomahawk in her brain. It wasthe signal for a massacre. Magua raised the fatal and appallingwar-whoop. At its sound two thousand savages broke from the wood andfell upon the unresisting victims. Death was everywhere and in his mostterrific and disgusting aspect."It is the jubilee of devils" said David who in spite of hisuselessness never dreamed of deserting his trust. "If David tamed theevil spirit of Saul it may not be amiss to try the potency of musichere."He poured out a strain of song that echoed even over the din of thatbloody field. Magua heard it and through the throng of savages rushedto their side."Come" he cried seizing Alice in his blood-stained arms "the wigwamof the Huron is still open"In vain Cora begged him to release her sister. Across the plain he boreher swiftly followed by Cora and David. As soon as he reached thewoods he placed the two girls on horses that were waiting there andnever heeding David who mounted the remaining steed dashed forwardinto the wilds._IV.--Captives of the Hurons_Three days after the surrender of the fort Hawk-eye and his two Mohicancompanions accompanied by Munroe and Duncan stood upon the fatalplain. Everywhere they had searched for the bodies of the two girls andnowhere could they be found. It was clear to Hawk-eye that they stilllived and had been carried off by Magua. With untiring energy he at
comment363,once set off to try and discover the trail. It was Uncas who finding aportion of Cora's skirt caught on a bush first opened up the line ofpursuit. He it was too who read the track of Magua's feet on theground--the unmistakable straddling toe of the drinking savage. Anornament dropped by Alice and the large footprints of thesinging-master laid bare to the trained intelligence of the Indianscout everything that had happened.As they reached the outskirts of a clearing they perceived amelancholy-looking savage in war-paint and moccasins seated by the sideof a stream watching a colony of beavers busily engaged in making a dam.Duncan was about to fire but Hawk-eye roaring with laughter stayedhis arm. The savage was none other than David.Alice and Cora were near at hand and Duncan was all eager to make hisway to their side. Hawk-eye so far humoured his whim as to consent tohis visiting the encampment disguised as a medicine man.As soon as he entered the camp he declared that he had been sent by theGrand Monarque to heal the ills of the Hurons. The chief to whom hespoke listened to him for some time and then asked him to show hisskill by frightening away the evil spirit that lived in the wife of oneof his young men. Duncan could not refuse though he felt certain thatthe trial of his skill would result in the detection of his disguise.Just as the chief was about to lead the way to the woman's side Maguajoined the group to be followed shortly afterwards by a number of youngmen bringing with them a prisoner. A cry went up "Le Cerf Agile" andevery warrior sprang to his feet. To his dismay Duncan saw that it wasUncas. Magua gazed at his captive gravely for some time then raisinghis arm shook it at him exclaiming "Mohican you die"Duncan's conductor led him to a cave which went some distance into therocky side of the mountain. As he entered Duncan saw a darkmysterious-looking object that rose unexpectedly in his path. It was abear and though the young soldier knew that the Indians often kept suchanimals as pets its deep growls and the manner in which it clutched athim as he passed up the long narrow passage of the cave caused him nota little uneasiness.Having shown him the sick woman who it was clear was dying theIndians left the supposed medicine man to fight the devils by himself.To his horror Duncan saw that the bear remained behind growlingsavagely. Watching it uneasily he noticed its head suddenly fall on oneside and in its place appeared the sturdy countenance of the scout. Asquickly as he could Hawk-eye explained how he had come across a wizardpreparing for a _sance_ how he had knocked him on the head and takenthe bear's skin in which the charlatan had proposed to make his magic.While the scout rearranged his disguise Duncan searching the cave inanother compartment discovered Alice. But even as the girl was in thefirst throes of delight at this unexpected meeting the guttural laugh
comment364,of Magua was heard and she saw the dark form and malignant visage ofthe savage."Huron do your worst" exclaimed the excited Heyward as he saw thatall his plans were brought to nought."Will the white man speak these words at the stake" asked Maguaturning to leave the cave. As he did so the bear growled loudly andthreateningly believing it to be one of the wizards Magua attempted topass it contemptuously. Suddenly the animal rushed at him and seizinghim in its arms completely overpowered him. Duncan at once ran to thescout's assistance and secured the savage.At Hawk-eye's suggestion Alice was wrapped up in the dying woman'sclothes and completely hidden from view was carried out of the cave."The disease has gone out of her" explained Duncan to the father andhusband who waited without. "I go to take the woman to a distance whereI will strengthen her against any further attack. Let my children waitwithout and if the evil spirit appears beat him down with clubs."Leaving the Indians with a certainty that they would not enter thecavern and discover Magua Duncan and the scout made their way to thehut where Uncas lay bound. Entering with David they released theMohican and immediately hastened to take the next step suggested by theresourceful Hawk-eye. David was secure from all harm so the scoutstepping out of his bear-skin dressed himself in the singing-master'sclothes while Uncas donned the wizard's disguise. Thus arrayed theyventured out among the natives leaving David within. Without beingsuspected they passed through the encampment but they had not got farbefore a yell announced that their subterfuge had been discovered. Uncascast his skin and having used their rifles with deadly effect he andthe scout made their escape into the woods taking Alice with them._V.--Hawk-eye's Revenge_Magua for motives of policy had while keeping Alice in his own handsentrusted Cora to the neighbouring tribe of Tortoise Delawares. Thitherwent Magua to find that the scout and his companions were before him.Nothing daunted Magua almost persuaded the Tortoises to surrender thegirl. As the chief of the tribe hesitated how to act Uncas steppedforward and bared his breast. A cry rose from all present for theredelicately tatooed on the young Mohican's skin was the emblem of aTortoise. In him the tribe recognised the long-lost scion of the purestrace of the Delawares who tradition said still wandered far andunknown on the hills and through the forests.But in spite of Uncas's authority the Indian law could not be setaside. Cora was Magua's captive of war. He had sought her in peace andshe must follow him. By all the laws of Indian hospitality his personwas sacred till the setting of the sun.As soon as the Maquas had disappeared the Tortoises made ready for warwith all the grim and terrifying ceremonies of their race. As hour afterhour slipped by the savage spirit of the tribe increased in fury. Uncasalone remained unmoved. Standing in the midst of the now maddenedsavages he kept his eyes fixed upon the declining sun. It dippedbeneath the horizon at once the whole encampment was broken up and thewarriors rushed down the trail which Magua had followed.As soon as they came in touch with the enemy a desperate and bloodybattle was fought. Under the leadership of the two Mohicans andHawk-eye victory swayed to the side of the Tortoises. Huron after Huronfell until only Magua and two companions were left. Then with a yellLe Renard Subtil rushed from the field of battle and seizing Cora ranup a steep defile towards the mountains. On the side of the precipiceCora refused to move any farther."Woman" cried Magua raising his knife "choose--the wigwam or theknife of Le Subtil"Cora neither heard nor heeded his demands. Magua trembled in every
comment365,fibre. He raised his arm on high. Just then a piercing cry was heardfrom above and Uncas leapt frantically from a fearful height upon theledge on which they stood. He fell prostrate for a moment. As he laythere Magua plunged his knife into his back and at the same moment oneof the other Indians stretched Cora lifeless. With the last effort ofhis strength Uncas rose to his feet and hurled Cora's murderer into theabyss below. Then with a stern and steady look he turned to Le Subtiland indicated with the expression of his eye all that he would do hadnot the power deserted him Magua seized his nerveless arm and stretchedhim dead by passing his dagger several times through his body."Mercy" cried Heyward from above. "Give mercy and thou shalt receiveit"For answer Magua raised a shout of triumph and leaping a widefissure made for the summit of the mountain. A single bound would carryhim to the brow of the precipice and assure his safety. Before takingthe leap he shook his hand defiantly at Hawk-eye who waited with hisrifle raised."The pale faces are dogs The Delawares women Magua leaves them on therocks for the crows"Making a desperate leap and falling short of his mark Magua savedhimself by grasping some shrub on the verge of the height. With aneffort he pulled himself up. Hawk-eye whose rifle shook with suppressedexcitement watched him closely. As his body was thus collectedtogether he drew the weapon to his shoulder and fired.The arms of the Huron relaxed and his body fell back a little but hisknees still kept their position. Turning a relentless look on his enemyhe shook his hand at him in grim defiance. But his hold loosened andhis dark person was seen cutting the air with its head downwards for afleeting instant until it glided past the fringe of shrubbery in itsrapid flight to destruction.                                   The Spy      Cooper's first success "The Spy" appeared when he was     thirty-two and his novel-writing period extended over a     quarter of a century. The best tales--the famous     Leatherstocking series--were begun two years after "The Spy."     Susceptible patriotism has discovered in his writings an     anti-English bias but "The Spy" is rather a proof of balanced     judgment in the midst of sharp national antagonisms._I.--Uncomfortable Visitors_Near the close of the year 1780 a solitary traveller was pursuing hisway through one of the numerous little valleys of New York State whichwere then common ground for the British and Revolutionary forces.Anxious to obtain a speedy shelter from the increasing violence of thestorm the traveller knocked at the door of a house which had an air
comment366,altogether superior to the common farmhouses of the country. In answerto his knocking an aged black appeared and without seeming to thinkit necessary to consult his superiors acceded to the request foraccommodation.The stranger was shown into a neat parlour where after politelyrepeating his request to an old gentleman who arose to receive him andpaying his compliments to three ladies who were seated at work withtheir needles he commenced laying aside his outer garments andexhibited to the scrutiny of the observant family party a tall andgraceful person apparently fifty years of age. His countenance evinceda settled composure and dignity his eye was quiet thoughtful andrather melancholy the mouth expressive of decision and much character.His whole appearance was so decidedly that of a gentleman that theladies arose and together with the master of the house received anewand returned the complimentary greetings suitable for the occasion.After handing a glass of excellent Madeira to his guest Mr. Whartonfor so was the owner of this retired estate called threw an inquiringglance on the stranger and asked "To whose health am I to have thehonour of drinking"The traveller replied while a faint tinge gathered on his features--"Mr. Harper.""Mr. Harper" resumed the other with the formal precision of the day"I have the honour to drink your health and to hope you will sustain noinjury from the rain to which you have been exposed."Mr. Harper bowed in silence to the compliment and seated himself by thefire with an air of reserve that baffled further inquiry.The storm now began to rage without with great violence and on the waybeing led to the supper-table a loud summons again called the black tothe portal. In a minute he returned and informed his master that anothertraveller desired shelter for the night.Mr. Wharton who had risen from his seat in evident uneasiness scarcelyhad time to bid the black show the second man in before the door wasthrown hastily open and the stranger himself entered the apartment. Hepaused a moment as the person of Harper met his view and then repeatedthe request he had made through the servant.Throwing aside a rough great-coat the intruder very composedlyproceeded to allay the cravings of an appetite which appeared by nomeans delicate. But at every mouthful he turned an unquiet eye onHarper who studied his appearance with a closeness that was veryembarrassing. At length pouring out a glass of wine and nodding to hisexaminer the newcomer said "I drink to our better acquaintance sir Ibelieve this is the first time we have met though your attention wouldseem to say otherwise.""I think we have never met before sir" replied Harper with a slightsmile and then appearing satisfied with his scrutiny he rose anddesired to be shown to his place of rest.The knife and fork fell from the hands of the unwelcome intruder as thedoor closed on the retiring figure of Harper listening attentively heapproached the door opened it--amid the panic and astonishment of hiscompanions--closed it again and in an instant the red wig whichconcealed his black locks the large patch which hid half his face thestoop that made him appear fifty years of age disappeared."My father my dear father" cried the handsome young man."Heaven bless you my Henry my son" exclaimed the astonished anddelighted parent while his sisters sank on his shoulders dissolved intears.A twelvemonth had passed since Captain Wharton had seen his family andnow having impatiently adopted the disguise mentioned he hadunfortunately arrived on the evening that an unknown and rathersuspicious guest was an inmate of the house."Do you think he suspects me" asked the captain."How should he" cried Sarah his elder sister "when your sisters andfather could not penetrate your disguise.""There is something mysterious in his manner his looks are too pryingfor an indifferent observer" continued young Wharton thoughtfully "and
comment367,his face seems familiar to me. The recent fate of Andr has created muchirritation on both sides. The rebels would think me a fit subject fortheir plans should I be so unlucky as to fall into their hands. My visitto you would seem to them a cloak to other designs."_II.--The Disguise That Failed_The morning still forbade the idea of exposing either man or beast tothe tempest. Harper was the last to appear and Henry Wharton hadresumed his disguise with a reluctance amounting to disgust but inobedience to the commands of his parent.While the company were yet seated at breakfast Caesar the blackentered and laid a small parcel in silence by his master."What is this Caesar" inquired Mr. Wharton eyeing the bundlesuspiciously."The baccy sir Harvey Birch he got home and he bring you a littlegood baccy."To Sarah Wharton this intelligence gave unexpected pleasure and risingfrom her seat she bade the black show Birch into the apartment addingsuddenly with an apologising look "If Mr. Harper will excuse thepresence of a pedlar."The stranger bowed a silent acquiescence while Captain Wharton placedhimself in a window recess and drew the curtain before him in such amanner as to conceal most of his person from observation.Harvey Birch had been a pedlar from his youth and was in no waydistinguished from men of his class but by his acuteness and the mysterywhich enveloped his movements. Those movements were so suspicious thathis imprisonments had been frequent.The pedlar soon disposed of a considerable part of the contents of hispack to the ladies telling the news while he displayed his goods."Have you any other news friend" asked Captain Wharton in a pauseventuring to thrust his head without the curtains."Have you heard that Major Andr has been hanged" was the reply."Is there any probability of movements below that will make travellingdangerous" asked Harper.Birch answered slowly "I saw some of De Lancey's men cleaning theirarms as I passed their quarters for the Virginia Horse are now in thecounty.""You must be known by this time Harvey to the officers of the BritishArmy" cried Sarah smiling at the pedlar."I know some of them by sight" said Birch glancing his eyes round theapartment taking in their course Captain Wharton and resting for aninstant on the countenance of Harper.The party sat in silence for many minutes after the pedlar hadwithdrawn until at last Mr. Harper suddenly said "If any apprehensionsof me induce Captain Wharton to maintain his disguise I wish him to beundeceived had I motives for betraying him they could not operate underpresent circumstances."The sisters sat in speechless surprise while Mr. Wharton was stupefiedbut the captain sprang into the middle of the room and exclaimed as hetore off his disguise "I believe you from my soul and this tiresomeimposition shall continue no longer. You must be a close observer sir.""Necessity has made me one" said Harper rising from his seat.Frances the younger sister met him as he was about to withdraw andtaking his hand between both her own said with earnestness "Youcannot you will not betray my brother"For an instant Harper paused and then folding her hands on his breastreplied solemnly "I cannot and I will not" and added "If theblessing of a stranger can profit you receive it." And he retired witha delicacy that all felt to his own apartment.In the afternoon the sky cleared and as the party assembled on the lawnto admire the view which was now disclosed the pedlar suddenlyappeared."The rig'lars must be out from below" he remarked with great emphasis"horse are on the road there will soon be fighting near us." And heglanced his eye towards Harper with evident uneasiness.As Birch concluded Harper who had been contemplating the view turnedto his host and mentioned that his business would not admit of
comment368,unnecessary delay he would therefore avail himself of the fine eveningto ride a few miles on his journey.There was a mutual exchange of polite courtesy between the host and hisparting guest and as Harper frankly offered his hand to CaptainWharton he remarked "The step you have undertaken is one of muchdanger and disagreeable consequences to yourself may result from it. Insuch a case I may have it in my power to prove the gratitude I owe yourfamily for its kindness.""Surely sir" cried the father "you will keep secret the discoverywhich your being in my house has enabled you to make"Harper turned to the speaker and answered mildly "I have learnednothing in your family sir of which I was ignorant but your son issafer from my knowledge of his visit than he would be without it."And bowing to the whole party he rode gracefully through the littlegate and was soon lost to view."Captain Wharton do you go in to-night" asked the pedlar abruptlywhen this scene had closed."No" said the captain laconically."I rather guess you had better shorten your visit" continued thepedlar coolly."No no Mr. Birch here I stay till morning I brought myself out andcan take myself in. Our bargain went no further than to procure mydisguise and to let me know when the coast was clear and in the latterparticular you were mistaken.""I was" said the pedlar "and the greater the reason why you should goback to-night. The pass I gave you will serve but once.""Here I stay this night come what will.""Captain Wharton" said the pedlar with great deliberation "beware atall Virginian with huge whiskers he is below you the devil can'tdeceive him I never could but once."_III.--A Dangerous Situation_The family were assembled round the breakfast-table in the morning whenCaesar who was looking out of the window exclaimed "Run Massa Harryrun here come the rebel horse."Captain Wharton's sisters with trembling hands had hastily replacedthe original disguise when the house was surrounded by dragoons andthe heavy tread of a trooper was heard outside the parlour door. The manwho now entered the room was of colossal stature with dark hair aroundhis brows in profusion and his face nearly hid in the whiskers by whichit was disfigured. Frances saw in him at once the man from whosescrutiny Harvey Birch had warned them there was much to be apprehended."Has there been a strange gentleman staying with you during the storm"asked the dragoon."This gentleman here favoured us with his company during the rain"stammered Mr. Wharton."This gentleman" repeated the other as he contemplated Captain Whartonwith a lurking smile and then with a low bow continued "I am sorryfor the severe cold you have in your head sir causing you to coveryour handsome locks with that ugly old wig."Then turning to the father he proceeded "Then sir I am tounderstand a Mr. Harper has not been here""Mr. Harper" echoed the other "yes I had forgotten but he is goneand if there is anything wrong in his character we are in entireignorance of it.""He is gone--how when and whither""He departed as he arrived" said Mr. Wharton gathering confidence "onhorseback last evening he took the northern road."The officer turned on his heel left the apartment and gave orderswhich sent some of the horsemen out of the valley by its various roads
comment369,at full speed.Then re-entering the room he walked up to Wharton and said with somegravity "Now sir may I beg to examine the quality of that wig And ifI could persuade you to exchange this old surtout for that handsome bluecoat I think you never could witness a more agreeable metamorphosis."Young Wharton made the necessary changes and stood an extremelyhandsome well-dressed young man."I am Captain Lawton of the Virginian Horse" said the dragoon."And I sir am Captain Wharton of His Majesty's 60th Regiment ofFoot" returned Henry bowing.The countenance of Lawton changed from quaintness to great earnestnessas he exclaimed "Then Captain Wharton from my soul I pity you"Captain Lawton now inquired if a pedlar named Birch did not live in thevalley."At times only I believe sir" replied Mr. Wharton cautiously. "He isseldom here I may say I never see him.""What is the offence of poor Birch" asked the aunt."Poor" cried the captain "if he is poor King George is a badpaymaster.""I am sorry" said Mr. Wharton "that any neighbour of mine should incurdispleasure.""If I catch him" cried the dragoon "he will dangle from the limbs ofone of his namesakes."In the course of the morning Major Dunwoodie who was an old friend ofthe family and the lover of Frances the younger daughter arrivedtook over the command of the troop and inquired into the case of hisfriend the prisoner."How did you pass the pickets in the plains" he asked."In disguise" replied Captain Wharton "and by the use of this passfor which I paid and which as it bears the name of Washington is Ipresume forged."Dunwoodie caught the paper eagerly and after gazing at the signaturefor some time said "This name is no counterfeit. The confidence ofWashington has been abused. Captain Wharton my duty will not suffer meto grant you a parole--you must accompany me to the Highlands."_IV.--Justice by Evasion_The Wharton family by order of Washington now removed to theHighlands out of the region of warlike operations and Captain Whartonwas brought to trial. The court condemned him to execution as a spybefore nine o'clock on the morning following the trial the presidenthowever expressing his intention of riding to Washington's headquartersand urging a remission of the punishment. But the sentence of the courtwas returned--_approved_. All seemed lost."Why not apply to Mr. Harper" said Frances recollecting for the firsttime the parting words of their guest."Harper" echoed Dunwoodie who had joined the family consultation."What of him Do you know him""He stayed with us two days. He seemed to take an interest in Henry andpromised him his friendship.""What" exclaimed the youth in astonishment "did he know your
comment370,brother""Certainly it was at his request that Henry threw aside his disguise.""But" said Dunwoodie "he knew him not as an officer of the royalarmy""Indeed he did and cautioned him against this very danger bidding himapply to him when in danger and promising to requite the son for thehospitality of the father.""Then" cried the youth "will I save him. Harper will never forget hisword.""But has he power" said Frances "to move Washington's stubbornpurpose""If he cannot" shouted Dunwoodie "who can Rest easy for Henry issafe."                                   It was while these consultations were proceeding that a divine offanatical aspect preceded by Csar sought admission to the prisoner tooffer him the last consolations of religion and so persistent were hisdemands that at last he was allowed a private interview. Then heinstantly revealed himself as Harvey Birch and proceeded to disguiseCaptain Wharton as Csar the black servant who had entered the roomwith him. So complete was the make-up that the minister and Whartonpassed unsuspected through the guard and it was only when the officeron duty entered the room to cheer up the prisoner after his interviewwith the "psalm-singer" that the real Csar was discovered and infright hurriedly revealed that the consoling visitor had been the pedlarspy.The pursuit was headlong and close but when once the rocky fastnesseswere reached the heavy-booted dragoons were for the moment out of thechase and Harvey Birch conducted Captain Wharton at leisure towards oneof his hiding-places while the mountain was encircled by the watchfultroopers._V.--Unexpected Meetings_When passing into the Highlands from her now desolated home FrancesWharton had noticed under the summit of one of the rockiest heights asa stream of sunlight poured upon it what seemed to be a stone hutthough hardly distinguishable from the rocks. Watching this place forit was visible from her new home she had fancied more than once thatshe saw near the hut a form like that of Harvey Birch. Could it be oneof the places from which he kept watch on the plains below On hearingof her brother's escape she felt convinced that it was to this hut thatthe pedlar would conduct him and there at night she repaired alone--atoilsome and dangerous ascent.The hut was reached at last and the visitor applying her eye to acrevice found it lighted by a blazing fire of dry wood. Against thewalls were suspended garments fitted for all ages and conditions andeither sex. British and American uniforms hung side by side. Sitting ona stool with his head leaning on his hand was a man more athletic thaneither Harvey or her brother. He raised his face and Frances instantlyrecognised the composed features of Harper. She threw open the door ofthe hut and fell at his feet crying "Save him save my brotherremember your promise""Miss Wharton" exclaimed Harper. "But you cannot be alone""There is none here but my God and you and I conjure you by His sacredName to remember your promise"Harper gently raised her and placed her on the stool saying "MissWharton that I bear no mean part in the unhappy struggle betweenEngland and America it might now be useless to deny. You owe yourbrother's escape this night to my knowledge of his innocence and theremembrance of my word. I could not openly have procured his pardon butnow I can control his fate and prevent his recapture. But thisinterview and all that has passed between us must remain a secretconfined to your own bosom."Frances gave the desired assurance."The pedlar and your brother will soon be here but I must not be seenby the royal officer or the life of Birch might be the forfeit. Did SirHenry Clinton know the pedlar had communion with me the miserable manwould be sacrificed at once. Therefore be prudent be silent. Urge them
comment371,to instant departure. It shall be my care that there shall be none tointercept them."While he was speaking the voice of the pedlar was heard outside in loudtones. "Stand a little farther this way Captain Wharton and you cansee the tents in the moonshine."Harper pressed his finger to his lip to remind Frances of her promiseand entering a recess in the rock behind several articles of dress washid from view.The surprise of Henry and the pedlar on finding Frances in possession ofthe hut may be imagined."Are you alone Miss Fanny" asked the pedlar in a quick voice."As you see me Mr. Birch" said Frances with an expressive glancetowards the secret cavern a glance which the pedlar instantlyunderstood."But why are you here" exclaimed her astonished brother.Frances related her conjecture that this would be the shelter of thefugitives for the night but implored her brother to continue his flightat once. Birch added his persuasions and soon the girl heard themplunging down the mountain-side at a rapid rate.Immediately the noise of their departure ceased Harper reappeared andleading Frances from the hut conducted her down the hill to where asheep-path led to the plain. There pressing a kiss on her forehead hesaid "Here we must part. I have much to do and far to ride. Forget mein all but your prayers."She reached her home undiscovered as her brother reached the Britishlines and on meeting her lover Major Dunwoodie in the morning learnedthat the American troops had been ordered suddenly by Washington towithdraw from the immediate neighbourhood._VI.--Last Scenes_The war was drawing to its close when the American general sitting inan apartment at his headquarters asked of the aide-de-camp inattendance "Has the man I wished to see arrived sir""He waits the pleasure of your excellency.""I will receive him here and alone."In a few minutes a figure glided in and by a courteous gesture wasmotioned to a chair. Washington opened a desk and took from it a smallbut apparently heavy bag."Harvey Birch" said he turning to the visitor "the time has arrivedwhen our connection must cease. Henceforth and forever we must bestrangers.""If it be your excellency's pleasure" replied the pedlar meekly."It is necessary. You have I trusted most of all. You alone know mysecret agents in the city. On your fidelity depend not only theirfortunes but their lives. I believe you are one of the very few whohave acted faithfully to our cause and while you have passed as a spyof the enemy have never given intelligence that you were not permittedto divulge. It is impossible to do you justice now but I fearlesslyentrust you with this certificate. Remember in me you will always havea secret friend though openly I cannot know you. It is now my duty topay you your postponed reward.""Does your excellency think I have exposed my life and blasted mycharacter for money No not a dollar of your gold will I touch PoorAmerica has need of it all""But remember the veil that conceals your true character cannot beraised. The prime of your days is already past. What have you to subsiston""These" exclaimed Harvey Birch stretching forth his hands."The characters of men much esteemed depend on your secrecy. What pledgecan I give them of your fidelity""Tell them" said Birch "that I would not take the gold."The officer grasped the hand of the pedlar as he exclaimed "Nowindeed I know you"                                   It was thirty-three years after the interview just related that anAmerican army was once more arrayed against the troops of England butthe scene was transferred from the banks of the Hudson to those of theNiagara.The body of Washington had long lain mouldering in the tomb but his
comment372,name was hourly receiving new lustre as his worth and integrity becamemore visible.The sound of cannon and musketry was heard above the roar of thecataract. On both sides repeated and bloody charges had been made. Whilethe action was raging an old man wandering near was seen to throw downsuddenly a bundle he was carrying and to seize a musket from a fallensoldier. He plunged headlong into the thick of the fight and borehimself as valiantly as the best of the American soldiers. When in theevening the order was given to the shattered troops to return to campCaptain Wharton Dunwoodie found that his lieutenant was missing andtaking a lighted fusee he went himself in quest of the body. Thelieutenant was found on the side of the hill seated with greatcomposure but unable to walk from a fractured leg."Ah dear Tom" exclaimed Dunwoodie "I knew I should find you thenearest man to the enemy""No" said the lieutenant. "There is a brave fellow nearer than myself.He rushed out of our smoke to make a prisoner and he never came back.He lies just over the hillock."Dunwoodie went to the spot and found an aged stranger. He lay on hisback his eyes closed as if in slumber and his hands pressed on hisbreast contained something that glittered like silver.The subject of his care was a tin box through which the bullet hadpierced to find a way to his heart and the dying moments of the old manmust have been passed in drawing it from his bosom.Dunwoodie opened it and found a paper on which he read"Circumstances of political importance which involve the lives andfortunes of many have hitherto kept secret what this paper reveals.Harvey Birch has for years been a faithful and unrequited servant of hiscountry. Though man does not may God reward him for his conduct GEO.WASHINGTON."It was the spy of the neutral ground who died as he had lived devotedto his country.                                   MRS. CRAIKJohn Halifax Gentleman      Dinah Maria Mulock whose fame as a novelist rests entirely     on "John Halifax Gentleman" was born at Stoke-upon-Trent     England on April 20 1826. She was thirty-one when "John     Halifax" came out and immediately found herself one of the     most popular novelists her story having a great vogue     throughout the English-speaking world and being translated     into half a dozen languages including Greek and Russian. In     1864 Miss Mulock married George Lillie Craik and until her     death on October 12 1887 she actively engaged herself in     literary work. In all forty-six works stand to her credit     but none show unusual literary power. Even "John Halifax"     leaves much to be desired and its great popularity arises     perhaps from its sentimental interest. The character of the     hero conceived on the most conventional lines has at least     the charm that comes from the contemplation of a strong and     upright man and although many better stories have not enjoyed     one tithe of its popularity "John Halifax Gentleman" still     deserves to be read as a wholesome and profitable story._I.--The Tanner's Apprentice_"Get out o' Mr. Fletcher's road you idle lounging little----""Vagabond" was no doubt what Sally Watkins the old nurse of PhineasFletcher was going to say but she had changed her mind in lookingagain at the lad who ragged and miserable as he was was anything buta "vagabond."On their way home a downpour of rain had drawn Mr. Fletcher and his sonPhineas to shelter in the covered alley that led to Sally's house. Mr.Fletcher pushed the little hand-carriage in which his weak and ailingson was seated into the alley. The ragged boy who had also beensheltering there lent a hand in bringing Phineas out of the rain Mr.Fletcher saying to him kindly after Sally's outburst "Thee need not go
comment373,into the wet. Keep close to the wall and there will be shelter enoughboth for us and thee."Mr. Fletcher was a wealthy tanner in Norton Bury. Years ago his wife haddied leaving him with their only child Phineas now a sickly boy ofsixteen.The ragged lad who had seemed very grateful for the Quaker's kind wordsto him stood leaning idly against the wall looking at the rain thatsplashed on the pavement of the High Street. He was a boy perhaps offourteen years but despite his serious and haggard face he was talland strongly built with muscular limbs and square broad shoulders sothat he looked seventeen or more. The puny boy in the hand-carriage wasfilled with admiration for the manly bearing of the poor lad.The rain at length gave promise of ceasing and Mr. Fletcher pullingout his great silver watch never known to be wrong said "Twenty-threeminutes lost by this shower. Phineas my son how am I to get thee homeUnless thee wilt go with me to the tanyard--"Phineas shook his head and his father then called to Sally Watkins ifshe knew of anyone who would wheel him home. But at the moment Sally didnot hear and the ragged boy mustered courage to speak for the firsttime""Sir I want work may I earn a penny" he said taking off his tatteredold cap and looking straight into Mr. Fletcher's face. The old manscanned the honest face of the lad very closely."What is thy name lad""John Halifax.""Where dost thee come from""Cornwall.""Hast thee any parents living"The lad answered that he had not and to many other questions with whichthe tanner plied him he returned straightforward answers. He waspromised a groat if he would see Phineas safely home when the rain hadceased and was asked if he would care to take the piece of silver now."Not till I've earned it sir" said the Cornish lad. So Mr. Fletcherslipped the money into his boy's hand and left them. Only a few wordswere spoken between the two lads for a little while after he had goneand John Halifax stood idly looking across the narrow street at themayor's house with its steps and porticoes and its fourteen windowsone of which was open showing a cluster of little heads within. Themayor's children seemed to be amused watching the shivering shelterersin the alley but presently a somewhat older child appeared among themand then went away from the window quickly. Soon afterwards a front doorwas partly opened by someone whom another was endeavoring to restrainfor the boys on the other side of the street could hear loud words frombehind the door."I will I say I will----""You sha'n't Miss Ursula""But I will" And there stood the young girl with a loaf in one handand a carving-knife in the other. She hastily cut off a slice of bread."Take it poor boy You look so hungry" she said. "Do take it" But thedoor was shut again upon a sharp cry of pain the headstrong little girlhad cut her wrist with the knife.In a little John Halifax went across and picked up the slice of breadwhich had fallen on the doorstep. At the best of times wheaten breadwas then a dainty to the poor and perhaps the Cornish lad had nottasted a morsel of it for months.Phineas from the moment he had set eyes on John liked the lad and
comment374,living a very lonely life with no playfellows and no friends of his ownage he longed to be friends with this strong-looking honest youth whohad come so suddenly into his life while John had been so tender inhelping Phineas home that the Quaker boy felt sure he would make aworthy friend.It later appeared that John had heard of his own father as a sad solemnsort of man much given to reading. He had been described to him as "ascholar and a gentleman" and John had determined that he too would bea scholar and a gentleman. He was only an infant when his father diedand his mother left very poor had a sore struggle until her own deathwhen the boy was only eleven years old. Since then the lonely lad hadbeen wandering about the country getting odd jobs at farms at othertimes almost starving.Thus had he wandered to Norton Bury and now thanks to Phineas Mr.Fletcher gave him a job at the tannery although at first the worthyQuaker was not altogether sure of John's character.Soon however the two lads were fast friends and spent much of theirtime together. John Halifax could read but he had not yet learnt towrite so Phineas became his friendly tutor and repaid his devotion byteaching him all he knew.The years wore away John Halifax labouring faithfully if not alwayscontentedly in the tannery and in time old Mr. Fletcher finding himworthy of the highest trust John came to be manager of the businessand to live in the house of his master. In knowledge too he had grownfor Phineas had proved a good tutor and John so apt a pupil that beforelong Phineas confessed that John knew more than himself._II.--Ursula March_It happened that John and Phineas were spending the summer days at therural village of Enderley where they lived at Rose Cottage. Enderleywas not far from Norton Bury and every day John rode there to lookafter the tannery and the flour-mill which had recently been added toMr. Fletcher's now flourishing business.This Rose Cottage was really two houses in one of which the young menlived while an invalid gentleman and his daughter occupied the other.John Halifax had noted this young lady in his walks across the breezydowns and thought her the sweetest creature he had seen. Later when hegot to know that her name was Ursula he was thrilled with happymemories of the little girl who had thrown him the slice of bread forhe had heard her called by that same name. He wondered if this might beshe grown into a young woman.Ere long he came to know his pretty neighbour to companion her in ruralwalks. No artist ever painted a more attractive picture than these twomade stepping briskly across the wind-swept uplands she with hersparkling dark eyes her great mass of brown curls escaping from herhood and John with his frank ruddy face and his fine swinging manlyfigure.Ursula's father who had come here ailing died at the cottage and wasburied in Enderley churchyard. He had been the same Henry March whoselife John had saved years before when the Avon was in flood. He wascousin to Squire Brithwood who also owed his life to John on the sameoccasion. Unhappily Ursula's fortune was left in the keeping of thathighly undesirable person.John was very sad at the thought of Ursula leaving the cottage for thesquire's home at Mythe House for he knew that she had been happierthere in the sweet country retreat than she would ever be in the
comment375,ill-conducted household of her guardian. She too had regrets at thethought of going as John and she had become fast friends. He told herthat Mr. Brithwood would probably deny his right to be considered afriend of hers and would not allow his claim to be thought a gentlemanthough a poor one."It is right" he pursued on her expression of surprise "that youshould know who and what I am to whom you are giving the honour of yourkindness. Perhaps you ought to have known before but here at Enderleywe seem to be equals--friends.""I have indeed felt it so.""Then you will the sooner pardon my not telling you--what you neverasked and I was only too ready to forget--that we are _not_ equals--that is society would not regard us as such and I doubt if even youyourself would wish us to be friends.""Why not""Because you are a gentlewoman and I am a tradesman."She sat--the eyelashes drooping over her flushed cheeks--perfectlysilent. John's voice grew firmer prouder there was no hesitation now."My calling is as you will hear at Norton Bury that of a tanner. I amapprentice to Abel Fletcher Phineas's father.""Mr. Fletcher" She looked up at him with a mingled look of kindlinessand pain."Ay Phineas is a little less beneath your notice than I am. He is richand has been well educated I have had to educate myself. I came toNorton Bury six years ago--a beggar-boy. No not quite so bad as thatfor I never begged. I either worked or starved."The earnestness the passion of his tone made Miss March lift her eyesbut they fell again."Yes Phineas found me starving in an alley. We stood in the rainopposite the mayor's house. A little girl--you know her Miss March--came to the door and threw out to me a bit of bread."Now indeed she started. "You Was that you"John paused and his whole manner changed into softness as he resumed."I never forgot that little girl. Many a time when I was inclined to dowrong she kept me right--the remembrance of her sweet face and herkindness."That face was pressed against the sofa where she sat. Miss March was allbut weeping."I am glad to have met her again" he went on "and glad to have beenable to do her some small good in return for the infinite good she oncedid me. I shall bid her farewell now at once and altogether."
comment376,A quick involuntary turn of the hidden face seemed to ask him "Why""Because" John said "the world says we are not equals and it would beneither for Miss March's honour nor mine did I try to force upon it thetruth--which I may prove openly one day--that we _are_ equals."Miss March looked up at him--it were hard to say with what expressionof pleasure of pride or simple astonishment perhaps a mingling ofall then her eyelids fell. Her left arm was hanging over the sofa thescar being visible enough. John took the hand and pressed his lips tothe place where the wound had been."Poor little hand--blessed little hand" he murmured. "May God bless itevermore"_III.--The Rise of John Halifax_After John Halifax had returned to Norton Bury he was seized with feverand for a time his recovery seemed doubtful. In his delirium he calledaloud for Ursula and dreamed that she had come to sit with him askinghim to live for her sake. Phineas in his anxiety for his friendbrought Ursula to him and the dream came true for she did ask him tolive for her sake.Not long after his recovery John Halifax became Mr. Fletcher's partner.Going to London on behalf of the business he met there the greatstatesman Mr. Pitt who was impressed with the natural abilities of theyoung man. John's reputation for honesty and sound commonsense had nowgrown so great at Norton Bury that when he returned there he foundhimself one of the most respected men in the town.Although still far from being rich he was no longer a poor worker andas Ursula was willing to share his life they boldly determined to bemarried in spite of her guardian who asserted that John would nevertouch a penny of Ursula's fortune. They contrived however to be happywithout it for he refused to go to law to recover his wife's money andwas determined he would work honestly to support her.With the death of old Mr. Fletcher however came misfortune for it wasfound that the tannery was no longer a paying property and there wereonly the mills to go on with. At this time Ursula's relative LordLuxmore who was anxious to see the Catholic Emancipation Bill passedthought he could use John Halifax for his purpose by offering to get himreturned to parliament for the "rotten borough" of Kingswell the memberfor which was then elected by only fifteen voters. Twelve of these weretenants of Lord Luxmore and the other three of Phineas. But althoughJohn would have supported the Bill he was too honest to let himself beelected for a "rotten borough." So he declined and Luxmore next triedto win him over by offering the lease of some important cloth-mills heowned but these he would not take on credit and he had no money to payfor them.At this juncture Ursula told Luxmore about the behaviour of his kinsmanBrithwood with the result that his lordship went to Brithwood and madehim turn over the money to her. When John now purchased the lease of themills his lordship thought that he had secured him firmly and thatHalifax would use his great and growing influence with the people of thedistrict to further Luxmore's political schemes.While all this was going on young Lord Ravenel the son and heir ofLuxmore had been a constant visitor at the Halifax home and delighted
comment377,in the company of John's daughter. Halifax had now three children twoboys named Guy and Edmund and Muriel who alas had been born blind.Perhaps on account of her infirmity she had been the pet of her parentsbut she was of a gentle nature and was beautiful to look upon evenwith her sightless eyes.The time for the election of the member for Kingswell had come roundand as Luxmore had failed to induce John Halifax to stand he put up apliable nominee. But he was greatly mistaken in supposing that Johnwould use his influence to make the handful of voters most of whom wereemployed in his mills vote for Luxmore's man. Instead of that Halifaxadvised them to be honest and vote as they thought right with theresult that Luxmore promptly evicted them from their homes. But Johnfound new homes for them.As his riches increased he bought a stately country mansion namedBeechwood not far from Rose Cottage ever dear in memory to him.Another son Walter was born there and everything seemed to smile onhim in his beautiful country home. Luxmore now sought to injure him bydiverting the water from his cloth-mills and leaving his great wheelsidle. Halifax could have taken him to law but instead of that he setup a strange new-fangled thing called a steam-engine and his millsdid better than ever.Finding it useless to fight against the resourceful Halifax Luxmorewent abroad and left his son Lord Ravenel alone at Luxmore Hall. Theyoung man despite his father's unfriendly conduct was still a frequentvisitor at Beechwood and when poor Muriel died his grief at her losswas only less than that of her parents.The years passed by and happiness still reigned at Beechwood butRavenel had deserted them until one day John Halifax met him greatlychanged from the gentle youth of the past at Norton Bury. John invitedhim to ride over with him to Enderley."Enderly How strange the word sounds Yet I should like to see theplace again" said Ravenel who decided to accompany John Halifax andPhineas Fletcher in their drive back to Beechwood. He inquired kindlyfor all the family and was told that Guy and Walter were as tall ashimself while the daughter----"Your daughter" said his lordship with a start. "Oh yes Irecollect--Baby Maud Is she at all like--like----""No" said John Halifax. Neither said more than this but it seemed asif their hearts warmed to one another knitted by the same tenderremembrance._IV.--The Journey's End_Lord Ravenel had returned to reside again at Luxmore Hall and hisvisits to Beechwood became as regular as they had been in the old daysat the Halifax home when Muriel was alive. It was the society of Maudin which his lordship now delighted though he never forgot the sereneand happy days he had spent with her blind sister.Before long Lord Ravenel sought to be regarded as suitor for the handof Maud who would thus have become the future Countess of Luxmore. Hesaid that he would wait two years for her if her father wished it butJohn Halifax would make him no promise and urged him rather toendeavour first to become a more worthy man so that he might redeem theevil reputation which the conduct of his own father had brought upon thename of Luxmore."Do you recognise what you were born to be" said Halifax to him. "Notonly a nobleman but a gentleman not only a gentleman but a man--manmade in the image of God. Would to heaven that any poor word of minecould make you feel all that you are--and all that you might be""You mean Mr. Halifax what I might have been--now it is too late.""There is no such word as 'too late' in the wide world--nay not in theuniverse."Lord Ravenel for a time sat silent then he rose to go and thanked Mrs.Halifax for all her kindness in a voice choked with emotion."For your husband I owe him more than kindness as perhaps I may provesome day if not try to believe the best of me you can. Good-bye"It was not many weeks after this that the old Earl of Luxmore died in
comment378,France and it then became known that his son who now succeeded to thetitle had voluntarily given up his claims on the estate in order to paythe heavy debts of his worthless father.The home at Beechwood had lost another inmate--for Edmund was nowmarried--when Guy first going to Paris had later sailed for America.Years passed by and he became a successful merchant in Boston and thenone day he wrote home to say he was coming back to the Old Country andwas bringing with him his partner.The ship in which Guy and his friend sailed from America was wreckedand Ursula in her grief at the supposed loss of her eldest son seemedto be wearing away when one day a strange gentleman stood in thedoorway--tall brown and bearded--and asked to see Miss Halifax. Maudjust glanced at him then rose and said somewhat coldly "Will you beseated""Maud don't you know me Where is my mother"The return of the son whom she had given up for dead brought joy againto the heart of Ursula and her health seemed to revive but it wasclear that her days were now uncertain. Scarcely less than the delightin Guy's return was the discovery that his partner was none other thanthe new Earl of Luxmore who as plain Mr. William Ravenel had by hislife in America proved John Halifax was right when he said it was nottoo late for him to model his life on lines of true manliness. He hadindeed become all that John had desired of him--a man and agentleman--so that Maud was after all to be the Countess of Luxmore.But the days of John Halifax himself were now drawing to a close and hewas not without premonitions of his end for in his talks with PhineasFletcher who had remained his faithful companion all these years hespoke as one would speak of a new abode an impending journey. Deathcame to him very gently one day at sunset just after he had smiled toPhineas when his old friend looking towards Lord Luxmore and hisfuture bride who were with a group of the young people had said "Ithink sometimes John that William and Maud will be the happiest of allthe children."He smiled at this and a little later seemed to be asleep but when Maudcame up and spoke to him he was dead. While he was sleeping thus theMaster had called him. His sudden end was so great a shock to the fraillife of Ursula that when they buried John Halifax in the prettyEnderley churchyard they laid to rest with him his wife of three-and-thirty years who had been a widow but for a few hours.                                   GEORGE CROLYSalathiel or Tarry Thou Till I Come      George Croly the author of "Salathiel" was born at Dublin     on August 17 1780 and became a clergyman of the Church of     England. After a short time as curate in the north of Ireland     he came to London and devoted himself chiefly to literary     pursuits. In 1835 he was presented to the valuable living of
comment379,     St. Stephen's Walbrook London by Lord Brougham where his     eloquent preaching attracted large congregations. It was a     saying among Americans of the period "Be sure and hear     Croly" Croly was a scholar an orator and a man of     incredible energy. Poems biographies dramas sermons     novels satires magazine articles newspaper leaders and     theological works were dashed off by his facile pen and     according to Hogg the Ettrick shepherd he was great in     conversation. Croly's _chef d'oeuvre_ is "Salathiel" which     published in 1829 created a prodigious sensation Salathiel     being the character better known as the Wandering Jew. The     description of the fall of Jerusalem is a wonderful piece of     sustained eloquence hardly to be squalled in romantic     writings. Croly died on November 24 1860._I.--Immortality on Earth_"_Tarry thou till I come_" The words shot through me. I felt them likean arrow in my heart. The troops the priests the populace the worldpassed from before my senses like phantoms.Every fibre of my frame quivers as I still hear the echo of the anathemathat sprang first from my furious lips the self-pronounced ruin thewords of desolation "His blood be upon us and our children"But in the moment of my exultation I was stricken. He who had refused anhour of life to the victim was in terrible retribution condemned toknow the misery of life interminable. I heard through all the voices ofJerusalem--I should have heard through all the thunders of heaven thecalm low voice "Tarry thou till I come"I felt at once my fate. I sprang away through the shouting hosts as ifthe avenging angel waved his sword above my head. I was never to knowthe shelter of the grave Immortality on earth The perpetual compulsionof existence in a world made for change I was to survive my country.Wife child friend even to the last being with whom my heart couldimagine a human bond were to perish in my sight. I was to know no limitto the weight already crushing me. The guilt of life upon life thesurges of an unfathomable ocean of crime were to roll in eternalprogress over my head. Immortality on earthOverwhelmed with despair I rushed through Jerusalem crowded withmillions come to the Passover and made my way through the Gate of Zionto the open country and the mountains that were before me like abarrier shutting out the living world. There as I lay in an agony offear my soul seemed to be whirled on the wind into the bosom of athundercloud. I felt the weight of the rolling vapours. I saw a blaze. Iwas stunned by a roar that shook the firmament.When I recovered it was to hear the trumpet which proclaims that thefirst daily sacrifice is to be offered. I was a priest this day'sservice fell to me I dared not shrink from the duty which appalled meHumanity drove me first to my home where to my unspeakable relief Ifound my wife and child happy and unharmed then I went to the Temple
comment380,and began my solemn duties. I was at the altar the Levite at my sideholding the lamb when suddenly in rushed the high priest his faceburied in the folds of his cloak and grasping the head of the lamb hesnatched the knife from the Levite plunged it into the animal's throatand ran with bloody hands and echoing groans to the porch of the HolyHouse. I hastened up the steps after him and entered the sanctuary.But--what I saw there I have no power to tell. Words were not made toutter it. Before me moved things mightier than of mortal visionthronging shapes of terror mysterious grandeur essential powerembodied prophecy. On the pavement lay the high priest his lipsstrained wide his whole frame rigid and cold as a corpse. And the Veilwas rent in twainFleeing from the Temple I came into a world of black men. The sunwhich I had seen like a fiery buckler hanging over the city was utterlygone. As I looked into this unnatural night the thought smote me that Ihad brought this judgment on the Holy City and I formed thedetermination to fly from my priesthood my kindred and my country andto bear my doom in some barren wilderness.I ran from the Temple where priests clung together in pale terrorfound my wife and child and bore them away through the panic-strickencity. As we journeyed a yell of universal terror made me turn my eyes toJerusalem. A large sphere of fire shot through the heavens casting apallid illumination on the myriads below. It stopped above the city andexploded in thunder flashing over the whole horizon but covering theTemple with a blaze which gave it the aspect of metal glowing in afurnace. Every pillar and pinnacle was seen with a lurid and terribledistinctness. The light vanished. I heard the roar of earthquake theground rose and heaved under my feet. I heard the crash of buildingsthe fall of fragments of the hills and louder than both the groans ofthe multitude. The next moment the earth gave way and I was caught upin a whirlwind of dust and ashes._II.--The Son of Misfortune_It was in Samaria I woke. Miriam my wife was at my side. A troop ofour kinsmen returning from the city where terror suffered few toremain had discovered us and brought us with them on their journey.On this pilgrimage to Naphtali my native home my absence from prayerand my sadness struck all our kinsmen and Eleazer brother of Miriamquestioned me thereon. In my bitterness I said to him that I hadrenounced my career among the rulers of Israel. Instead of anger orsurprise his face expressed joy. He pointed out to me the tomb ofIsaiah to which we were approaching. "There lies" said he "the heartwhich neither the desert nor the dungeon nor the teeth of the lion northe saw of Manasseh could tame--the denouncer of our crimes the scourgeof our apostasy the prophet of that desolation which was to bow thegrandeur of Judah to the grave."He drew a copy of the Scriptures from his bosom and read the famousHaphtorah. "Who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of theLord revealed For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and asa root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when weshall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him. He isdespised and rejected of men a man of sorrows" He stopped laid hishand upon my arm and asked "Of whom hath the prophet spoken Him that_is to come_ still _to come_" Then he left me.Some years passed away the burden remained upon my soul. One day as Idwelt among my kinsmen in Naphtali I was watching a great storm whensuddenly there stood before me a spirit accursed and evil Epiphanesone of those spirits of the evil dead who are allowed from time to timeto reappear on earth."Power you shall have and hate it" he announced "wealth and life andhate them. You shall be the worm among a nation of worms--you shall besteeped in poverty to the lips--you shall undergo the bitterness ofdeath until----Come" he cried suddenly "son of misfortune emblemof the nation that living shall die and dying shall live thattrampled by all shall trample on all that bleeding from a thousandwounds shall be unhurt that beggared shall wield the wealth of
comment381,nations that without a name shall sway the council of kings thatwithout a city shall inhabit in all the kingdoms that scattered likethe dust shall be bound together like the rock that perishing by thesword chain famine and fire shall be imperishable unnumberedglorious as the stars of heaven."I was caught up and swept towards Jerusalem. It was the twilight of asummer evening. Town and wall lay bathed in a sea of purple the Templerose from its centre like an island of light the host of Heaven cameriding up the blue fields alone all was the sweetness calm andsplendour of a painted vision. As the night deepened a murmur from thecity caught my ear it grew loud various wild it was soon mixed withthe clash of arms trumpets rang torches blazed along battlements andturrets the roar of battle rose deepened into cries of agony swelledinto furious exultation. "Behold" said the possessed "these are butthe beginnings of evil" I looked up the spirit was gone. In anotherminute I was plunging into the valley and rushing forward to thebattle.From that moment I became a chieftain of Israel and as Prince ofNaphtali led my people against the legions of Rome. I came to be apriest I became a captain. I was ever in the midst of battle I wascast into dungeons brought to the cross cast among lions shipwreckeddriven out to sea on a blazing trireme accused before Nero and Titusexposed a thousand times to death and yet ever at the extreme momentsome mysterious hand interfered between my life and its destruction. Icould not die._III.--The Abomination of Desolation_And through all these awful years of incessant warfare I was now liftedup on a wave of victory to heights of dazzling glory and now plungeddown into the abysm of defeat. I saw my wife and children torn from merestored only to be dragged away again. I saw Rome driven from the HolyCity only to see her return in triumph. And all through these maddeningvicissitudes suspected by my own people and knowing my own infamy Iheard the voice "Tarry thou till I come"The fall of our illustrious and unhappy city was supernatural. Duringthe latter days of the siege a hostility to which that of man was asthe grain of sand to the tempest that drives it on overpowered ourstrength and senses. Fearful shapes and voices in the air visionsstartling us from our short and troubled sleep lunacy in its mosthideous forms sudden death in the midst of vigour the fury of theelements let loose upon our unsheltered heads we had every evil andterror that could beset human nature but pestilence the most probableof all in a city crowded with the famishing the diseased the woundedand the dead. Yet though the streets were covered with the unburiedthough every wall and trench was teeming though six hundred thousandcorpses lay flung over the ramparts and naked to the sun--pestilencecame not. But the abomination of desolation the pagan standard wasfixed where it was to remain until the plough passed over the ruins ofJerusalem.On this fatal night no man laid his head upon his pillow. Heaven andearth were in conflict. Meteors burned above us the ground shook underour feet the volcano blazed the wind burst forth in irresistibleblasts and swept the living and the dead in whirlwinds far off into thedesert. Thunder pealed from every quarter of the heavens. Lightning inimmense sheets withering eye and soul burned from the zenith to theground and marked its track by forests on flame and the shatteredsummits of hills.Defence was unthought of for the mortal enemy had passed from the mind.Our hearts quaked from fear but it was to see the powers of heavenshaken. All cast away the shield and the spear and crouched before thedescending judgment. Our cries of remorse anguish and horror wereheard through the uproar of the storm. We howled to the caverns to hideus we plunged into the sepulchres to escape the wrath that consumedthe living.I knew the cause the unspeakable cause knew that the last hour of
comment382,crime was at hand. A few fugitives astonished to see one man not sunkinto the lowest feebleness of fear besought me to lead them intosafety. I said they were to die and pointed them to the hallowed groundof the Temple. More I led them towards it myself. But advance waschecked. Piles of cloud whose darkness was palpable even in themidnight covered the holy hill. I attempted to pass through it and wasswept downward by a gust that tore the rocks in a flinty shower aroundme.While I lay helpless I heard the whirlwind roar through the cloudyhill and the vapours began to revolve. A pale light like that of therising moon quivered on their edges and the clouds rose and rapidlyshaped themselves into the forms of battlements and towers. Voices wereheard within low and distant yet strangely sweet. Still the lustrebrightened and the airy building rose tower on tower and battlementon battlement. In awe we knelt and gazed upon this more than mortalarchitecture. It stood full to earth and heaven the colossal image ofthe first Temple. All Jerusalem saw the image and the shout that inthe midst of their despair ascended from its thousands and tens ofthousands told what proud remembrances were there. But a hymn was heardthat might have hushed the world. Never fell on mortal ear sound somajestic and subduing so full of melancholy and grandeur and command.The vast portal opened and from it marched a host such as man had neverseen before such as man shall never see but once again the guardianangels of the city of David They came forth glorious but with woe intheir steps tears flowing down their celestial beauty. "Let us gohence" was their song of sorrow. "Let us go hence" was announced bythe echoes of the mountains.The procession lingered on the summit. The thunder pealed and they roseat the command diffusing waves of light over the expanse of heaven.Then the thunder roared again the cloudy temple was scattered on thewinds and darkness the omen of her grave settled upon Jerusalem._IV.--The Hour of Doom_I was roused by the voice of a man. "What" said he "poring over thefaces of dead men when you should be foremost among the living AllJerusalem in arms and yet you scorn your time to gain laurels" Isprang up and drew my scimitar for the man was--Roman."You should know me" he said calmly "it is some years since we metbut we have not been often asunder.""Are you not a Roman" I exclaimed. He denied that nationality andoffered me his Roman trappings cuirass and falchion saying they wouldhelp me to money riot violence and vice in the doomed city "and"said he "what else do nine-tenths of mankind ask for in their souls"He tore his helmet from his forehead and with a start of inward painflung it to a measureless distance in the air. I beheld--Epiphanes "Itold you" he said "that this day would come. One grand hope was givento your countrymen they cast it from them Ages on ages shall passbefore they learn the loftiness of that hope or fulfill the punishmentof that rejection. Yet in the fullness of time light shall break upontheir darkness. They shall ask Why are barbarians and civilised alike
comment383,our oppressors Why do contending faiths join in crushing us alone Whydo realms distant as the ends of the earth unite in scorn of us""Man of terrible knowledge" I demanded "tell me for what crime thisjudgment comes""There is no name for it" he said with solemn fear."Is there no hope" said I trembling."Look to that mountain" was the answer as he pointed to Moriah. "It isnow covered with war and slaughter. But upon that mountain shall yet beenthroned a Sovereign before whom the sun shall hide his head. Fromthat mountain shall light flow to the ends of the universe and thegovernment shall be of the everlasting."In a few minutes he had carried me to the city placed me on abattlement and had disappeared.Below me war raged in its boundless fury. The Romans had forced theirway the Jews were fighting like wild beasts. When the lance was brokethe knife was the weapon when the knife failed they tore with theirhands and teeth. But the Romans advanced against all. They advanced tillthey were near the inner temple. A scream of wrath and agony at thepossible profanation of the Holy of Holies rose from the multitude. Ileaped from the battlement called upon Israel to follow me and drovethe Romans back.But Jerusalem was marked for ruin. A madman prophesying the succour ofheaven prevented Israel from surrendering and thus saving the Temple.Infuriated by his words the populace kept up the strife and the Templeburst into flames. The fire sprang through the roof and the whole ofits defenders to the number of thousands sank into the conflagration.In another minute the inner temple was on fire. I rushed forward andtook my post before the veil of the portico to guard the entrance withmy blood.But the legions rushed onward crying that "they were led by the Fates"and that "the God of the Jews had given his people and city into theirhands." The torrent was irresistible. Titus rushed in at its headexclaiming that "the Divinity alone could have given the stronghold intohis power for it was beyond the hope and strength of man." Mycompanions were torn down. I was forced back to the veil of the Holy ofHolies. I longed to die I fought I taunted covered from head to footin gore. I remained without a wound.Then came a new enemy--fire. I heard its roar round the sanctuary. TheRomans fled to the portal. A wall of fire stood before them. They rushedback tore down the veil and the Holy of Holies stood open.The blaze melted the plates of the roof in a golden shower above me. Itcalcined the marble floor it dissipated in vapour the inestimable gemsthat studded the walls. All who entered lay turned to ashes. But on thesacred Ark the flame had no power. It whirled and swept in a red orbround the untouched symbol of the throne of thrones. Still I lived butI felt my strength giving way--the heat withered my sinews the flameextinguished my sight. I sank upon the threshold rejoicing that deathwas inevitable. Then once again I heard the words of terror. "Tarrythou till I come" The world disappeared before me._V.--The Pilgrim of Time_
comment384,Here I pause. I had undergone that portion of my career which was to bepassed among my people. My life as father husband citizen was at anend. Thenceforth I was to be a solitary man. I was to make my couch withthe savage the outcast and the slave. I was to see the ruin of themighty and the overthrow of empires. Yet in the tumult that changed theface of the world I was still to live and be unchanged.In revenge for the fall of Jerusalem I traversed the globe to seek outan enemy of Rome. I found in the northern snows a man of blood Istirred up the soul of Alaric and led him to the sack of Rome. Inrevenge for the insults heaped upon the Jew by the dotards and dastardsof the city of Constantine I sought out an instrument of compendiousruin. I found him in the Arabian sands and poured ambition into thesoul of Mecca. In revenge for the pollution of the ruins of the TempleI roused the iron tribes of the West and at the head of the Crusadersexpelled the Saracens. I fed full on revenge and fed the misery ofrevenge.A passion for human fame seized me. I drew my sword for Italytriumphed was a king and learned to curse the hour when I firstdreamed of fame. A passion for gold seized me. Wealth came to my wishand to my torment. Days and nights of misery were the gift of avarice.In my passion I longed for regions where the hand of man had neverrifled the mine. I found a bold Genoese and led him to the discoveringof a new world. With its metals I inundated the old and to my miseryadded the misery of two hemispheres.Yet the circle of passion was not to surround my fated steps for ever.Noble aspirations rose in my melancholy heart. I had seen the birth oftrue science true liberty and true wisdom. I had lived with Petrarchstood enraptured beside the easel of Angelo and Raphael. I had stood atMaintz beside the wonder-working machine that makes knowledgeimperishable and sends it with winged speed through the earth. At thepulpit of the mighty man of Wittenberg I had knelt Israelite as I wasand am I did involuntary homage to the mind of Luther.At this hour I see the dawn of things to whose glory the glory of thepast is but a dream. But I must close these thoughts wandering as thesteps of my pilgrimage. I have more to tell--strange magnificent andsad. But I must await the impulse of my heart.                                   RICHARD HENRY DANATwo Years Before the Mast      Richard Henry Dana was born at Cambridge Massachusetts on     August 1 1815. He was the son of the American poet who with     W.C. Bryant founded "The North American Review" and grandson     of Francis Dana for some time United States Minister to     Russia and afterwards Chief Justice of Massachusetts. Young     Dana entered Harvard in 1832 but being troubled with an     affection of the eyes shipped as a common sailor on board an     American merchant vessel and made a voyage round Cape Horn to     California and back. His experiences are embodied in his "Two     Years Before the Mast" which was published in 1840 about     three years after his return when he had graduated at     Harvard and in the year in which he was admitted to the     Massachusetts Bar. His best known work gives a vivid account     of life at sea in the days of the old sailing ships touches     sympathetically on the hardships of the seafaring life which     its publication helped to ameliorate and affords also an     intimate glimpse of California when it was still a province of     Mexico. "If" he writes "California ever becomes a prosperous     country this--San Francisco--bay will be the centre of its     prosperity." He died at Rome on January 7 1882._I.--Life on a Merchantman_On August 14 the brig Pilgrim left Boston for a voyage round Cape Hornto the western coast of America. I made my appearance on board at twelveo'clock with an outfit for a two or three years' voyage which I hadundertaken from a determination to cure if possible by an entirechange of life and by a long absence from books and study a weakness
comment385,of the eyes.The vessel got under way early in the afternoon. I joined the crew andwe hauled out into the stream and came to anchor for the night. Thenext day we were employed in preparations for sea. On the followingnight I stood my first watch. During the first few days we had badweather and I began to feel the discomforts of a sailor's life. But Iknew that if I showed any sign of want of spirit or of backwardness Ishould be ruined at once. So I performed my duties to the best of myability and after a time I felt somewhat of a man. I cannot describethe change which half a pound of cold salt beef and a biscuit or twoproduced in me after having taken no sustenance for three days. I was anew being.As we had now a long "spell" of fine weather without any incident tobreak the monotony of our lives there can be no better place todescribe the duties regulations and customs of an Americanmerchantman of which ours was a fair specimen.The captain is lord paramount. He stands no watch comes and goes whenhe pleases is accountable to no one and must be obeyed in everything.The prime minister the official organ and the active andsuperintending officer is the chief mate. The mate also keeps thelog-book and has charge of the stowage safe keeping and delivery ofthe cargo.The second mate's is a dog's berth. The men do not respect him as anofficer and he is obliged to go aloft to put his hands into the tar andslush with the rest. The crew call him the "sailors' waiter" and he hasto furnish them with all the stuffs they need in their work. His wagesare usually double those of a common sailor and he eats and sleeps inthe cabin but he is obliged to be on deck nearly all his time and eatsat the second table--that is makes a meal out of what the captain andthe chief mate leave.The steward is the captain's servant and has charge of the pantry fromwhich everyone including the mate is excluded. The cook is the patronof the crew and those who are in his favour can get their wet mittensand stockings dried or light their pipes at the galley in the nightwatch. These two worthies together with the carpenter and thesailmaker if there be one stand no watch but being employed all dayare allowed to "sleep in" at night unless "all hands" are called.The crew are divided into two watches. Of these the chief mate commandsthe larboard and the second mate the starboard being on and off dutyor on deck and below every other four hours. The watch from 4 p.m. to 8p.m. is divided into two half or dog watches. By this means theydivide the twenty-four hours into seven instead of six and thus shiftthe hours every night.The morning commences with the watch on deck turning-to at daybreak andwashing-down scrubbing and swabbing the decks. This with filling the"scuttle butt" with fresh water and coiling up the rigging usuallyoccupies the time until seven bells half after seven when all handsget breakfast. At eight the day's work begins and lasts until sundownwith the exception of an hour for dinner. The discipline of the shiprequires every man to be at work upon something when he is up on deckexcept at night and on Sundays. No conversation is allowed among thecrew at their duty.When I first left port and found that we were kept regularly employedfor a week or two I supposed that we were getting the vessel intosea-trim and that it would soon be over and we should have nothing to
comment386,do but to sail the ship but I found that it continued so for two yearsand at the end of two years there was as much to be done as ever. Ifafter all the labour on sails rigging tarring greasing oilingvarnishing painting scraping scrubbing watching steering reefingfurling bracing making and setting sail and pulling hauling andclimbing in every direction the merchants and captains think thesailors have not earned their twelve dollars a month their salt beefand hard bread they keep them picking oakum--_ad infinitum_. ThePhiladelphia catechism is    Six days shalt thou labour and do all thou art able    And on the seventh holystone the decks and scrape the cable.We crossed the Equator on October 1 and rounded Cape Horn early inNovember. Monday November 17 was a black day in our calendar. At sevenin the morning we were aroused from sleep by the cry of "All handsahoy A man overboard" This unwonted cry sent a thrill through theheart of everyone and hurrying on deck we found the vessel hove flataback with all her studding sails set for the boy who was at the helmleft it to throw something overboard and the carpenter who was an oldsailor knowing that the wind was light put the helm down and hove heraback. The watch on deck were lowering away the quarter-boat and I goton deck just in time to heave myself into her as she was leaving theside. But it was not until out on the wide Pacific in our little boatthat I knew we had lost George Ballmer a young English sailor who wasprized by the officers as an active and willing seaman and by the crewas a lively hearty fellow and a good shipmate.He was going aloft to fit a strap round the main-topmast head forringtail halyards and had the strap and block a coil of halyards anda marlin spike about his neck. He fell and not knowing how to swim andbeing heavily dressed with all those things around his neck heprobably sank immediately. We pulled astern in the direction in which hefell and though we knew that there was no hope of saving him yet noone wished to speak of returning and we rowed about for nearly an hourunwilling to acknowledge to ourselves that we must give him up.Death is at all times solemn but never so much so as at sea and theeffect of it remains upon the crew for some time. There is more kindnessshown by the officers and by the crew to one another. The lost man isseldom mentioned or is dismissed with a sailor's rude eulogy "Wellpoor George is gone His cruise is up soon. He knew his work and didhis duty and was a good shipmate." We had hardly returned on board withour sad report before an auction was held of the POOR man's clothes._II.--At the Ends of the Earth_On Tuesday November 25 we reached the Island of Juan Fernandez. Wewere then probably seventy miles from it and so high did it appear thatI took it for a cloud until it gradually turned to a greener and deadercolour. By the afternoon the island lay fairly before us and wedirected our course to the only harbour. Never shall I forget thesensation which I experienced on finding myself once more surrounded byland as I stood my watch at about three the following morning feelingthe breeze coming off shore and hearing the frogs and crickets. To myjoy I was among the number ordered ashore to fill the water-casks. By
comment387,the morning of the 27th we were again upon the wide Pacific and we sawneither land nor sail again until on January 13 1835 we reached PointConception on the coast of California. We had sailed well to thewestward to have the full advantage of the north-east trades and sohad now to sail southward to reach the port of Santa Barbara where wearrived on the 14th after a voyage of 150 days from Boston.At Santa Barbara we came into touch with other vessels engaged inloading hides and tallow and as this was the work in which we were soonto be engaged we looked on with some curiosity especially at thelabours of the crew of the Ayacucho who were dusky Sandwich Islanders.And besides practice in landing on this difficult coast we experiencedthe difficulties involved in having suddenly to slip our cables andthen when the weather allowed of it coming to at our former moorings.From this time until May 8 1836 I was engaged in trading and loadingdrying and storing hides between Santa Barbara Monterey San PedroSan Diego San Juan and San Francisco.The ship California belonging to the same firm had been nearly twoyears on the coast before she collected her full cargo of 40000 hides.Another vessel the Lagoda carrying 31000 or 32000 had been nearlytwo years getting her cargo and when it appeared that we were tocollect some 40000 hides besides our own which would be 12000 or15000 the men became discontented. It was bad for others but worsefor me who did not mean to be a sailor for life. Three or four yearswould make me a sailor in every respect mind and habits as well asbody and would put all my companions so far ahead of me that collegeand a profession would be in vain to think of.We were at the ends of the earth in a country where there is neitherlaw nor gospel and where sailors are at their captain's mercy. We lostall interest in the voyage cared nothing about the cargo while we wereonly collecting for others began to patch our clothes and felt asthough we were fixed beyond hope of change._III.--A Tyrannical Captain_Apart from the incessant labour on board ship at San Pedro we had toroll heavy casks and barrels of goods up a steep hill to unload thehides from the carts at the summit reload these carts with our goodscast the hides over the side of the hill collect them and take them onboard. After we had been employed in this manner for several days thecaptain quarrelled with the cook had a dispute with the mate andturned his displeasure particularly against a large heavy-mouldedfellow called Sam.The man hesitated in his speech and was rather slow in his motions butwas a pretty good sailor and always seemed to do his best. But thecaptain found fault with everything he did. One morning when the gighad been ordered by the captain Mr. Russell an officer taken on atSanta Barbara John the Swede and I heard his voice raised in violentdispute with somebody. Then came blows and scuffling. Then we heard thecaptain's voice down the hatchway."You see your condition Will you ever give me any more of your jaw"No answer and then came wrestling and heaving as though the man wastrying to turn him."You may as well keep still for I have got you" said the captain whorepeated his question."I never gave you any" said Sam for it was his voice that we heard."That's not what I ask you. Will you ever be impudent to me again""I never have been sir" said Sam."Answer my question or I'll make a spread-eagle of you""I'm no negro slave" said Sam."Then I'll make you one" said the captain and he came to thehatchway sprang on deck threw off his coat and rolling up hissleeves called out to the mate "Seize that man up Mr. A-- Seize him
comment388,up Make a spread-eagle of him I'll teach you all who is masteraboard"The crew and officers followed the captain up the hatchway and afterrepeated orders the mate laid hold of Sam who made no resistance andcarried him to the gangway."What are you going to flog that man for sir" said John the Swede tothe captain.Upon hearing this the captain turned upon him but knowing him to bequick and resolute he ordered the steward to bring the irons andcalling upon Russell to help him went up to John."Let me alone" said John. "You need not use any force" And putting outhis hands the captain slipped the irons on and sent him aft to thequarter-deck.Sam by this time was placed against the shrouds his jacket off and hisback exposed. The captain stood at the break of the deck a few feetfrom him and a little raised so as to have a swing at him and held inhis hand the bight of a thick strong rope. The officers stood roundthe crew grouped together in the waist. Swinging the rope over his headand bending his body so as to give it full force the captain brought itdown upon the poor fellow's back. Once twice six times."Will you ever give me any more of your jaw"The man writhed with pain but said not a word. Three times more. Thiswas too much and he muttered something which I could not hear. Thisbrought as many more as the man could stand when the captain orderedhim to be cut down and to go forward.Then John the Swede was made fast. He asked the captain what he was tobe flogged for."Have I ever refused my duty sir Have you ever known me to hang backor to be insolent or not to know my work""No" said the captain. "I flog you for your interference--for askingquestions.""Can't a man ask a question here without being flogged""No" shouted the captain. "Nobody shall open his mouth aboard thisvessel but myself" And he began laying the blows upon the man's back.As he went on his passion increased and the man writhed under the pain.My blood ran cold. When John had been cut down Mr. Russell was orderedto take the two men and two others in the boat and pull the captainashore.After the day's work was done we went down into the forecastle and ateour supper but not a word was spoken. The two men lay in their berthsgroaning with pain and a gloom was over everything. I vowed that ifever I should have the means I would do something to redress thegrievances and relieve the sufferings of that poor class of beings of
comment389,whom I was then one._IV.--I Become a Hide-Curer_The comfort of the voyage was evidently at an end though I certainlyhad some pleasant days on shore and as we were continually engaged intransporting passengers with their goods to and fro in addition totrading our assorted cargo of spirits teas coffee sugars spicesraisins molasses hardware crockery-ware tinware cutlery clothingjewelry and in fact everything that can be imagined from Chinesefireworks to English cartwheels we gained considerable knowledge of thecharacter dress and language of the people of California.In the early part of May I was called upon to take up my quarters for afew months at our hide-house at San Diego. In the twinkling of an eye Iwas transformed into a beach-comber and hide-curer but the novelty andthe comparative independence of the life were not unpleasant. Mycompanions were a Frenchman named Nicholas and a boy who acted as cookFour Sandwich Islanders worked and ate with us but generally slept at alarge oven which had been built by the men of a Russian discovery shipand was big enough to hold six or eight men. Mr. Russell who was incharge had a small room to himself. On July 18 the Pilgrim returnedwith news. Captain T------ had taken command of a larger vessel theAlert and the owners at the request of my friends had written toCaptain T------ to take me on board should the Alert return to theStates before the Pilgrim.On September 8 I found myself on board the new vessel and with hervisited San Francisco as well as other ports already named. Our crewwere somewhat diminished we were short-handed for a voyage round CapeHorn in the depth of winter and so cramped and deadened was the Alertby her unusually large cargo and the weight of our five months storesthat her channels were down in the water while to make matters evenmore uncomfortable the forecastle leaked and in bad weather more thanhalf the berths were rendered tenantless. But "Never mind we'rehomeward bound" was the answer to everything.The crew included four boys regarding two of whom an incident may herebe chronicled. There was a little boxing-match on board while we were atMonterey in December. A broad-backed big-headed Cape Cod boy about
comment390,sixteen had been playing the bully over a slender delicate-looking boyfrom one of the Boston schools. One day George the Boston boy said hewould fight Nat if he could have fair play. The chief mate heard thenoise and attempted to make peace but finding it useless called allhands up ranged the crew in the waist marked a line on the deckbrought the two boys up to it and made them "toe the mark."Nat put in his double-fisters starting the blood and bringing theblack-and-blue spots all over the face and arms of the other whom weexpected to see give in every moment. But the more he was hurt thebetter he fought. Time after time he was knocked nearly down but up hecame again and faced the mark as bold as a lion again to take theheavy blows which sounded so as to make one's heart turn with pity forhim. At length he came up to the mark the last time his shirt torn fromhis body his face covered with blood and bruises and his eyes flashingwith fire and swore he would stand there until one or the other waskilled.And he set to like a young fury. "Hurrah in the bow" said the mencheering him on. Nat tried to close with him but the mate stopped that.Nat then came up to the mark but looked white about the mouth and hisblows were not given with half the spirit of his first. He was evidentlycowed. He had always been master and had nothing to gain and everythingto lose whilst the other fought for honour and freedom and under asense of wrong. It would not do. It was soon over. Nat gave in not somuch beaten as cowed and mortified and never afterwards tried to actthe bully on board._V.--An Adventurous Voyage Home_By Sunday June 19 we were in lat. 34 15' S. and long. 116 38' W.and bad weather prospects began to loom ahead. The days became shorterthe sun gave less heat the nights were so cold as to prevent oursleeping on deck the Magellan clouds were in sight of a clear nightthe skies looked cold and angry and at times a long heavy ugly seaset in from the southward. Being so deep and heavy the ship droppedinto the seas the water washing over the decks. Not yet within athousand miles of Cape Horn our decks were swept by a sea not half sohigh as we must expect to find there. Then came rain sleet snow andwind enough to take our breath from us. We were always getting wetthrough and our hands stiffened and numbed so that the work aloft wasexceptionally difficult. By July 1 we were nearly up to the latitude ofCape Horn and the toothache with which I had been troubled for severaldays had increased the size of my face so that I found it impossible toeat. There was no relief to be had from the impoverished medicine-chestand the captain refused to allow the steward to boil some rice for me."Tell him to eat salt junk and hard bread like the rest of them" he
comment391,said. But the mate who was a man as well as a sailor smuggled a pan ofrice into the galley and told the cook to boil it for me and not tolet the "old man" see it. Afterwards I was ordered by the mate to stayin my berth for two or three days.It was not until Friday July 22 that having failed to make thepassage of the Straits of Magellan we rounded the Cape and sightingthe island of Staten Land stood to the northward and ran for theinside of the Falkland Islands. With a fine breeze we crowded on all thecanvas the ship would bear and our "Cheerily men" was given with achorus that might have been heard halfway to Staten Land. Once we wereto the northward of the Falklands the sun rose higher in the horizoneach day the nights grew shorter and on coming on deck each morningthere was a sensible change in the temperature.On the 20th of the month I stood my last helm making between 900 and1000 hours at this work and 135 days after leaving San Diego ouranchor was upon the bottom in Boston Harbour and I had the pleasure ofbeing congratulated upon my return and my appearance of health andstrength.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Worlds Greatest Booksby Arthur Mee J.

ALPHONSE DAUDETTartarin of Tarascon      Alphonse Daudet the celebrated French novelist was born at     Nimes on May 13 1840 and as a youth of seventeen went to     Paris where he began as a poet at eighteen and at twenty-two     made his first efforts in the drama. He soon found his feet as     a contributor to the leading journals of the day and a     successful writer for the stage. He was thirty-two when he     wrote "Tartarin of Tarascon" than which no better comic tale     has been produced in modern times. Tarascon is a real town     not far from the birthplace of Daudet and the people of the     district have always had a reputation for "drawing the long     bow." It was to satirise this amiable weakness of his southern     compatriots that the novelist created the character of     Tartarin but while he makes us laugh at the absurd     misadventures of the lion-hunter it will be noticed how     ingeniously he prevents our growing out of temper with him     how he contrives to keep a warm corner in our hearts for the     bragging simple-minded good-natured fellow. That is to say     it is a work of essential humour and the lively style in     which the story is told attracts us to it time and again with     undiminished pleasure. In two subsequent books "Tartarin in     the Alps" and "Port Tarascon" Daudet recounted further     adventures of his delightful hero. His "Sapho" and "Kings in     Exile" have also been widely read. Daudet died on December 17     1897._I.--The Mighty Hunter at Home_I remember my first visit to Tartarin of Tarascon as clearly as if it
comment398,had been yesterday though it is now more than a dozen years ago. Whenyou had passed into his back garden you would never have fanciedyourself in France. Every tree and plant had been brought from foreignclimes he was such a fellow for collecting the curiosities of Naturethis wonderful Tartarin. His garden boasted for instance an example ofthe baobab that giant of the vegetable world but Tartarin's specimenwas only big enough to occupy a mignonette pot. He was mightily proud ofit all the same.The great sight of his place however was the hero's private den at thebottom of the garden. Picture to yourself a large hall gleaming from topto bottom with firearms and weapons of all sorts carbines riflesblunderbusses bowie-knives revolvers daggers flint-arrows--in aword examples of the deadly weapons of all races used by man in allparts of the world. Everything was neatly arranged and labelled as ifit were in a public museum. "Poisoned Arrows. Please do not touch" wasthe warning on one of the cards. "Weapons loaded. Have a care" greetedyou from another. My word it required some pluck to move about in theden of the great Tartarin.There were books of travel and adventure books about mighty hunting onthe table in the centre of the room and seated at the table was a shortand rather fat red-haired fellow of about forty-five with a closely-trimmed beard and a pair of bright eyes. He was in his shirtsleevesreading a book held in one hand while he gesticulated wildly with alarge pipe in the other--Tartarin He was evidently imagining himselfthe daring hero of the story.Now you must know that the people of Tarascon were tremendously keen onhunting and Tartarin was the chief of the hunters. You may think thisfunny when you know there was not a living thing to shoot at withinmiles of Tarascon scarcely a sparrow to attract local sportsmen. Ahbut you don't know how ingenious they are down there.Every Sunday morning off the huntsmen sallied with their guns andammunition the hounds yelping at their heels. Each man as he left inthe morning took with him a brand new cap and when they got well intothe country and were ready for sport they took their caps off threwthen high in the air and shot at them as they fell. In the evening youwould see them returning with their riddled caps stuck on the points oftheir guns and of all these brave men Tartarin was the most admired as
comment399,he always swung into town with the most hopeless rag of a cap at the endof a day's sport. There's no mistake he was a wonderBut for all his adventurous spirit he had a certain amount of caution.There were really two men inside the skin of Tartarin. The one Tartarinsaid to him "Cover yourself with glory." The other said to him "Coveryourself with flannel." The one imagining himself fighting Red Indianswould call for "An axe An axe Somebody give me an axe" The otherknowing that he was cosy by his fireside would ring the bell and say"Jane my coffee."One evening at Costecalde's the gunsmith's when Tartarin wasexplaining some mechanism of a rifle the door was opened and an excitedvoice announced "A lion A lion" The news seemed incredible but youcan imagine the terror that seized the little group at the gunsmith's asthey asked for more news. It appeared that the lion was to be seen in atravelling menagerie newly arrived from Beaucaire.A lion at last and here in Tarascon Suddenly when the full truth haddawned upon Tartarin he shouldered his gun and turning to MajorBravida "Let us go to see him" he thundered. Following him went thecap-hunters. Arrived at the menagerie where many Tarasconians werealready wandering from cage to cage Tartarin entered with his gun overhis shoulder to make inquiries about the king of beasts. His entrancewas rather a wet blanket on the other visitors who seeing their herothus armed thought there might be danger and were about to flee. Butthe proud bearing of the great man reassured them and Tartarincontinued his round of the booth until he faced the lion from the AtlasMountains.Here he stood carefully studying the creature who sniffed and growledin surly temper and then rising shook his mane and gave vent to aterrible roar directed full at Tartarin.Tartarin alone stood his ground stern and immovable in front of thecage and the valiant cap-hunters somewhat reassured by his braveryagain drew near and heard him murmur as he gazed on the lion "Ah yesthere's a hunt for you"Not another word did Tartarin utter that day. Yet next day nothing wasspoken about in the town but his intention to be off to Algeria to huntthe lions of the Atlas Mountains. When asked if this were true his pridewould not let him deny it and he pretended that it might be true. Sothe notion grew until that night at his club Tartarin announced amidtremendous cheering that he was sick of cap-hunting and meant verysoon to set forth in pursuit of the lions of the Atlas.Now began a great struggle between the two Tartarins. While the one wasstrongly in favour of the adventure the other was strongly opposed toleaving his snug little Baobab Villa and the safety of Tarascon. But hehad let himself in for this and felt he would have to see it through.So he began reading up the books of African travel and found from thesehow some of the explorers had trained themselves for the work byenduring hunger thirst and other privations before they set out.Tartarin began cutting down his food taking very watery soup. Early inthe morning too he walked round the town seven or eight times and atnights he would stay in the garden from ten till eleven o'clock alonewith his gun to inure himself to night chills while so long as themenagerie remained in Tarascon a strange figure might have been seen inthe dark prowling around the tent listening to the growling of thelion. This was Tartarin accustoming himself to be calm when the king ofbeasts was raging.The feeling began to grow however that the hero was shirking. Heshowed no haste to be off. At length one night Major Bravida went toBaobab Villa and said very solemnly "Tartarin you must go"
comment400,It was a terrible moment for Tartarin but he realised the solemnity ofthe words and looking around his cosy little den with a moist eye hereplied at length in a choking voice "Bravida I shall go" Having madethis irrevocable decision he now pushed ahead his final preparationswith some show of haste. From Bompard's he had two large trunks oneinscribed with "Tartarin of Tarascon. Case of Arms" and he sent toMarseilles all manner of provisions of travel including a patentcamp-tent of the latest style._II.--Tartarin Sets off to Lion-Land_Then the great day of his departure arrived. All the town was agog. Theneighbourhood of Baobab Villa was crammed with spectators. About teno'clock the bold hero issued forth."He's a Turk He's wearing spectacles" This was the astonished cry ofthe beholders and sure enough Tartarin had thought it his duty to donAlgerian costume because he was going to Algeria. He also carried twoheavy rifles one on each shoulder a huge hunting-knife at his waistand a revolver in a leather case. A pair of large blue spectacles wereworn by him for the sun in Algeria is terribly strong you know.At the station the doors of the waiting-room had to be closed to keepthe crowd out while the great man took leave of his friends makingpromises to each and jotting down notes on his tablets of the variouspeople to whom he would send lion-skins.Oh that I had the brush of an artist that I might paint you somepictures of Tartarin during his three days aboard the Zouave on thevoyage from Marseilles But I have no facility with the brush and merewords cannot convey how he passed from the proudly heroic to thehopelessly miserable in the course of the journey. Worst of all whilehe was groaning in his stuffy bunk he knew that a very merry party ofpassengers were enjoying themselves in the saloon. He was still in hisbunk when the ship came to her moorings at Algiers and he got up with asudden jerk under the impression that the Zouave was sinking. Seizinghis many weapons he rushed on deck to find it was not foundering butonly arriving.Soon after Tartarin had set foot on shore following a great negroporter he was almost stupefied by the babel of tongues butfortunately a policeman took him in hand and had him directed togetherwith his enormous collection of luggage to the European hotel.On arriving at his hotel he was so fatigued that his marvellouscollection of weapons had to be taken from him and he had to be carriedto bed where he snored very soundly until it was striking threeo'clock. He had slept all the evening through the night and morningand well into the next afternoonHe awakened refreshed and the first thought in his mind was "I'm inlion-land at last" But the thought sent a cold shiver through him andhe dived under the bedclothes. A moment later he determined to be up.Exclaiming "Now for the lions" he jumped on the floor and began hispreparations.His plan was to get out at once into the country take ambush for thenight shoot the first lion that came along and then back to the hotelfor breakfast. So off he went carrying not only his usual arsenal butthe marvellous patent tent strapped to his back. He attracted no littleattention as he trudged along and catching sight of a very fine camelhis heart beat fast for he thought the lions could not be far off now.It was quite dark by the time he had got only a little way beyond the
comment401,outskirts of the town scrambling over ditches and bramble-hedges. Aftermuch hard work of this kind the mighty hunter suddenly stoppedwhispering to himself "I seem to smell a lion hereabouts." He sniffedkeenly in all directions. To his excited imagination it seemed a likelyplace for a lion so dropping on one knee and laying one of his gunsin front of him he waited.He waited very patiently. One hour two hours but nothing stirred. Thenhe suddenly remembered that great lion-hunters take a little young goatwith them to attract the lion by its bleating. Having forgotten tosupply himself with one Tartarin conceived the happy idea of bleatinglike a kid. He started softly calling "Meh meh" He was really afraidthat a lion might hear him but as no lion seemed to be payingattention he became bolder in his "mehs" until the noise he made wasmore like the bellowing of a bull.But hush What was that A huge black object had for the moment loomedup against the dark blue sky. It stooped sniffing the ground thenseemed to move away again only to return suddenly. It must be the lionat last so taking a steady aim bang went the gun of Tartarin and aterrible howling came in response. Clearly his shot had told thewounded lion had made off. He would now wait for the female to appearas he had read in books.But two or more hours passed and she did not come and the ground wasdamp and the night air cold so the hunter thought he would camp forthe night. After much struggling he could not get his patent tent toopen. Finally he threw it on the ground in a rage and lay on the topof it. Thus he slept until the bugles in the barracks near by wakenedhim in the morning. For behold instead of finding himself out on theSahara he was in the kitchen garden of some suburban Algerian"These people are mad" he growled to himself "to plant theirartichokes where lions are roaming about. Surely I have been dreaming.Lions do come here there's proof positive."From artichoke to artichoke from field to field he followed the thintrail of blood and came at length to a poor little donkey he hadwoundedTartarin's first feeling was one of vexation. There is such a differencebetween a lion and an ass and the poor little creature looked soinnocent. The great hunter knelt down and tried to stanch the donkey'swounds and it seemed grateful to him for it feebly flapped its longears two or three times before it lay still for ever.Suddenly a voice was heard calling "Noiraud Noiraud" It was "thefemale." She came in the form of an old French woman with a large redumbrella and it would have been better for Tartarin to have faced afemale lion.When the unhappy man tried to explain how he had mistaken her littledonkey for a lion she thought he was making fun of her and belabouredhim with her umbrella. When her husband came on the scene the matter wassoon adjusted by Tartarin agreeing to pay eight pounds for the damage hehad done the price of the donkey being really something like eightshillings. The donkey owner was an inn-keeper and the sight ofTartarin's money made him quite friendly. He invited the lion-hunter to
comment402,have some food at the inn with him before he left. And as they walkedthither he was amazed to be told by the inn-keeper that he had neverseen a lion there in twenty yearsClearly the lions were to be looked for further south. "I'll maketracks for the south too" said Tartarin to himself. But he first ofall returned to his hotel in an omnibus. Think of it But before he wasto go south on the high adventure he loafed about the city of Algiersfor some time going to the theatres and other places of amusementwhere he met Prince Gregory of Montenegro with whom he made friends.One day the captain of the Zouave came across him in the town andshowed him a note about himself in a Tarascon newspaper. This spoke ofthe uncertainty that prevailed as to the fate of the great hunter andwound up with these words"Some Negro traders state however that they met in the open desert aEuropean whose description answers to that of Tartarin and who wasmaking tracks for Timbuctoo. May Heaven guard for us our hero"Tartarin went red and white by turns as he read this and realised thathe was in for it. He very much wished to return to his beloved Tarasconbut to go there without having shot some lions--one at least--wasimpossible and so it was Southward ho_III.--Tartarin's Adventures in the Desert_The lion-hunter was keenly disappointed after a very long journey inthe stage-coach to be told that there was not a lion left in allAlgeria though a few panthers might still be found worth shooting.He got out at the town of Milianah and let the coach go on as hethought he might as well take things easily if after all there were nolions to be shot. To his amazement however he came across a real livelion at the door of a caf."What made them say there were no more lions" he cried astounded atthe sight. The lion lifted in its mouth a wooden bowl from the pavementand a passing Arab threw a copper in the bowl at which the lion waggedits tail. Suddenly the truth dawned on Tartarin. He was a poor blindtame lion which a couple of negroes were taking through the streetsjust like a performing dog. His blood was up at the very idea. Shouting"You scoundrels to humiliate these noble beasts so" he rushed and tookthe degrading bowl from the royal jaws of the lion. This led to aquarrel with the negroes at the height of which Prince Gregory ofMontenegro came upon the scene.The prince told him a most untrue story about a convent in the north ofAfrica where lions were kept to be sent out with priests to beg formoney. He also assured him that there were lots of lions in Algeria andthat he would join him in his hunt.Thus it was in the company of Prince Gregory and with a following ofhalf a dozen negro porters that Tartarin set off early next morning forthe Shereef Plain but they very soon had trouble both with the portersand with the provisions Tartarin had brought for his great journey. Theprince suggested dismissing the negroes and buying a couple of donkeysbut Tartarin could not bear the thought of donkeys for a reason withwhich we are acquainted. He readily agreed however to the purchase ofa camel and when he was safely helped up on its hump he sorely wishedthe people of Tarascon could see him. But his pride speedily had a fallfor he found the movement of the camel worse than that of the boat incrossing the Mediterranean. He was afraid he might disgrace France.Indeed if truth must out France was disgraced So for the remainderof their expedition which lasted nearly a month Tartarin preferred towalk on foot and lead the camel.
comment403,One night in the desert Tartarin was sure he heard sounds just likethose he had studied at the back of the travelling menagerie atTarascon. He was positive they were in the neighbourhood of a lion atlast. He prepared to go forward and stalk the beast. The prince offeredto accompany him but Tartarin resolutely refused. He would meet theking of beasts alone Entrusting his pocket-book full of preciousdocuments and bank-notes to the prince in case he might lose it in atussle with the lion he moved forward. His teeth were chattering in hishead when he lay down trembling to await the lion.It must have been two hours before he was sure that the beast was movingquite near him in the dry bed of a river. Firing two shots in thedirection whence the sound came he got up and bolted back to where hehad left the camel and the prince--but there was only the camel therenow The prince had waited a whole month for such a chanceIn the morning he realised that he had been robbed by a thief whopretended to be a prince. And here he was in the heart of savage Africawith a little pocket money only much useless luggage a camel and nota single lion-skin for all his trouble.Sitting on one of the desert-tombs erected over pious Mohammedans thegreat man fell to weeping bitterly. But even as he wept the bushes werepushed aside a little in front of him and a huge lion presented itself.To his honour be it said Tartarin never moved a muscle but breathinga fervent "At last" he leapt to his feet and levelling his rifleplanted two explosive bullets in the lion's head. All was over in amoment for he had nearly blown the king of beasts to pieces But inanother moment he saw two tall enraged negroes bearing down upon him.He had seen them before at Milianah and this was their poor blind lionFortunately for Tartarin he was not so deeply in the desert as he hadthought but merely outside the town of Orleansville and a policemannow came up attracted by the firing and took full particulars.The upshot of it was that he had to suffer much delay in Orleansvilleand was eventually fined one hundred pounds. How to pay this was aproblem which he solved by selling all his extensive outfit bit by bit.When his debts were paid he had nothing but the lion's skin and thecamel. The former he dispatched to Major Bravida at Tarascon. Nobodywould buy the camel and its master had to face all the journey back toAlgiers in short stages on foot._IV.--The Home-Coming of the Hero_The camel showed a curious affection for him and followed him asfaithfully as a dog. When at the end of eight days' weary tramping hecame at last to Algiers he did all he could to lose the animal andhoped he had succeeded. He met the captain of the Zouave who told himthat all Algiers had been laughing at the story of how he had killed theblind lion and he offered Tartarin a free passage home.The Zouave was getting up steam next day as the dejected Tartarin hadjust stepped into the captain's long-boat when lo his faithful camelcame tearing down the quay and gazed affectionately at its friend.Tartarin pretended not to notice it but the animal seemed to implore
comment404,him with his eyes to be taken away. "You are the last Turk" it seemedto say "I am the last camel. Let us never part again O my Tartarin"But the lion-hunter pretended to know nothing of this ship of thedesert.As the boat pulled off to the Zouave the camel jumped into the waterand swam after it and was taken aboard. At last Tartarin had the joy ofhearing the Zouave cast anchor at Marseilles and having no luggage totrouble him he rushed off the boat at once and hastened through thetown to the railway station hoping to get ahead of the camel.He booked third class and quickly hid himself in a carriage. Off wentthe train. But it had not gone far when everybody was looking out of thewindows and laughing. Behind the train ran the camel--holding his owntooWhat a humiliating home-coming All his weapons of the chase left onMoorish soil not a lion with him nothing but a silly camel"Tarascon Tarascon" shout the porters as the train slows up at thestation and the hero gets out. He had hoped to slink home unobservedbut to his amazement he is received with shouts of "Long liveTartarin" "Three cheers for the lion-slayer" The people are wavingtheir caps in the air it is no joke they are serious. There is MajorBravida and there the more noteworthy cap-hunters who cluster roundtheir chief and carry him in triumph down the stairs.Now all this was the result of sending home the skin of the blind lion.But the climax was reached when following the crowd down the stairs ofthe station limping from his long run came the camel. Even thisTartarin turned to good account. He reassured his fellow-citizenspatting the camel's hump."This is my camel a noble beast It has seen me kill all my lions."And so linking his arm with the worthy major he calmly wended his wayto Baobab Villa amid the ringing cheers of the populace. On the road hebegan a recital of his hunts."Picture to yourself" he said "a certain evening in the openSahara----"                                     THOMAS DAYSandford and Merton      Thomas Day was born in London on June 22 1748 and educated     at the Charterhouse and at Corpus Christi College Oxford.     Entering the Middle Temple in 1765 he was called to the Bar     ten years later but never practised. A contemporary and     disciple of Rousseau he convinced himself that human     suffering was in the main the result of the artificial     arrangements of society and inheriting a fortune at an early     age he spent large sums in philanthropy. A poem written by him     in 1773 entitled "The Dying Negro" has been described as     supplying the keynote of the anti-slavery movement. His     "History of Sandford and Merton" published in three volumes     between the years 1783 and 1789 provided a channel through     which many generations of English people have imbibed a kind
comment405,     of refined Rousseauism. It retains its interest for the     philosophic mind despite the burlesque of _Punch_ and its     waning popularity as a book for children. Thomas Day died     through a fall from his horse on September 28 1789._I.--Mr. Barlow and his Pupils_In the western part of England lived a gentleman of a large fortunewhose name was Merton. He had a great estate in Jamaica but haddetermined to stay some years in England for the education of his onlyson. When Tommy Merton came from Jamaica he was six years old. Naturallyvery good-natured he had been spoiled by indulgence. His mother was sofond of him that she gave him everything he cried for and would not lethim learn to read because he complained that it made his head ache. Theconsequence was that though Master Merton had everything he wanted hewas fretful and unhappy made himself disagreeable to everybody andoften met with very dangerous accidents. He was also so delicatelybrought up that he was perpetually ill.Very near to Mr. Merton's seat lived a plain honest farmer namedSandford whose only son Harry was not much older than Master Mertonbut who as he had always been accustomed to run about in the fields tofollow the labourers when they were ploughing and to drive the sheep totheir pasture was active strong hardy and fresh-coloured. Harry hadan honest good-natured countenance was never out of humour and tookthe greatest pleasure in obliging others in helping those lessfortunate than himself and in being kind to every living thing. Harrywas a great favourite particularly with Mr. Barlow the clergyman ofthe parish who taught him to read and write and had him almost alwayswith him.One summer morning while Master Merton and a maid were walking in thefields a large snake suddenly started up and curled itself roundTommy's leg. The maid ran away shrieking for help whilst the child inhis terror dared not move. Harry who happened to be near ran up andseizing the snake by the neck tore it from Tommy's leg and threw it toa great distance. Mrs. Merton wished to adopt the boy who had so bravelysaved her son and Harry's intelligence so appealed to Mr. Merton thathe thought it would be an excellent thing if Tommy could also benefit byMr. Barlow's instruction. With this view he decided to propose to thefarmer to pay for the board and education of Harry that he might be aconstant companion to Tommy. Mr. Barlow on being consulted agreed totake Tommy for some months under his care but refused any monetaryrecompense.The day after Tommy went to Mr. Barlow's the clergyman took his twopupils into the garden and taking a spade in his own hand and givingHarry a hoe they both began to work. "Everybody that eats" he said"ought to assist in procuring food. This is my bed and that is Harry's.If Tommy you choose to join us I will mark you out a piece of groundall the produce of which shall be your own.""No indeed" said Tommy "I am a gentleman and don't choose to slavelike a ploughboy.""Just as you please Mr. Gentleman" said Mr. Barlow. And Tommy notbeing asked to share the plate of ripe cherries with which Mr. Barlowand Harry refreshed themselves after their labour wandereddisconsolately about the garden surprised and vexed to find himself ina place where nobody felt any concern whether he was pleased or not.Meanwhile Harry after a few words of advice from Mr. Barlow readaloud the story of "The Ants and the Flies" in which it is related howthe flies perished for lack of laying up provisions for the winterwhereas the industrious ants by working during the summer provided for
comment406,their maintenance when the bad weather came.Mr. Barlow and Harry then rambled into the fields where Mr. Barlowpointed out the several kinds of plants to be seen and told his littlecompanion the name and nature of each. When they returned to dinnerTommy who had been skulking about all day came in and being veryhungry was going to sit down to the table when Mr. Barlow said "Nosir though you are too much of a gentleman to work we who are not soproud do not choose to work for the idle"Upon this Tommy retired into a corner crying as if his heart wouldbreak when Harry who could not bear to see his friend so unhappylooked up half-crying into Mr. Barlow's face and said "Pray sirmay I do as I please with my dinner""Yes to be sure my boy" was the reply."Why then" said Harry "I will give it to poor Tommy who wants itmore than I do."Tommy took it and thanked Harry but without turning his eyes from theground."I see" said Mr. Barlow "that though certain gentlemen are too proudto be of any use to themselves they are not above taking the bread thatother people have been working hard for."At this Tommy cried more bitterly than before.The next day when they went into the garden Tommy begged that he mighthave a hoe too and having been shown how to use it soon worked withthe greatest pleasure which was much increased when he was asked toshare the fruit provided after the work was done. It seemed to him themost delicious fruit that he had ever tasted.Harry read as before the story this time being about the gentleman andthe basket-maker. It described how a rich man jealous of the happinessof a poor basket-maker destroyed the latter's means of livelihood andwas sent by a magistrate with his humble victim to an island where thetwo were made to serve the natives. On this island the rich man becausehe possessed neither talents to please nor strength to labour wascondemned to be the basket-maker's servant. When they were recalled therich man having acquired wisdom by his misfortunes not only treatedthe basket-maker as a friend during the rest of his life but employedhis riches in relieving the poor._II.--Gentleman Tommy Learns to Read_From this time forward Mr. Barlow and his two pupils used to work intheir garden every morning and when they were fatigued they retired tothe summer-house where Harry who improved every day in reading usedto entertain them with some pleasant story. Then Harry went home for aweek and the morning after when Tommy expected that Mr. Barlow wouldread to him as usual he found to his great disappointment thatgentleman was busy and could not. The same thing happening the next day
comment407,and the day after Tommy said to himself "Now if I could but read likeHarry I should not need to ask anybody to do it for me." So when Harryreturned Tommy took an early opportunity of asking him how he came tobe able to read."Why" said Harry "Mr. Barlow taught me my letters and then byputting syllables together I learnt to read.""And could you not show me my letters" asked Tommy."Very willingly" was Harry's reply. And the lessons proceeded so wellthat Tommy who learned the whole alphabet at the very first lesson atthe end of two months was able to read aloud to Mr. Barlow "The Historyof the Two Dogs" which shows how vain it is to expect courage in thosewho lead a life of indolence and repose and that constant exercise andproper discipline are frequently able to change contemptible charactersinto good ones.Later Harry read the story of Androcles and the Lion and asked how itwas that one person should be the servant of another and bear so muchill-treatment."As to that" said Tommy "some folks are born gentlemen and then theymust command others and some are born servants and they must do asthey are bid." And he recalled how the black men and women in Jamaicahad to wait upon him and how he used to beat them when he was angry.But when Mr. Barlow asked him how these people came to be slaves hecould only say that his father had bought them and that he was born agentleman."Then" said Mr. Barlow "if you were no longer to have a fine housenor fine clothes nor a great deal of money somebody that had all thesethings might make you a slave and use you ill and do whatever he likedwith you."Seeing that he could not but admit this Tommy became convinced that noone should make a slave of another and decided that for the future hewould never use their black William ill.Some days after this Tommy became interested in the growing of corn andHarry promising to get some seed from his father Tommy got up earlyand having dug very perseveringly in a corner of his garden to preparethe ground for the seed asked Mr. Barlow if this was not very good ofhim."That" said Mr. Barlow "depends upon the use you intend to make of thecorn when you have raised it. Where" he asked "will be the greatgoodness in your sowing corn for your own eating That is no more thanall the people round here continually do. And if they did not do itthey would be obliged to fast.""But then" said Tommy "they are not gentlemen as I am.""What" answered Mr. Barlow "must not gentlemen eat as well as othersand therefore is it not for their interest to know how to procure foodas well as other people""Yes sir" answered Tommy "but they can have other people to raise itfor them.""How does that happen""Why they pay other people to work for them or buy bread when it ismade.""Then they pay for it with money""Yes sir.""Then they must have money before they can buy corn""Certainly sir.""But have all gentlemen money"Tommy hesitated some time and at last said "I believe not alwayssir.""Why then" said Mr. Barlow "if they have not money they will find itdifficult to procure corn unless they raise it for themselves." And heproceeded to recount the History of the Two Brothers Pizarro andAlonzo the former of whom setting out on a gold-hunting expeditionprevailed upon the latter to accompany him and became dependent uponAlonzo who instead of taking gold-seeking implements provided himselfwith the necessaries for stocking a farm._III.--Town Life and Country Life_This story was followed by others describing life in different anddistant parts of the world and in addition to the knowledge theyacquired in this way Tommy and Harry in their intercourse with theirneighbours and in the cultivation of their gardens learned a greatdeal. Tommy in particular growing much kinder towards the poor andtowards dumb animals as well as growing in physical well-being.Mr. Barlow's young pupils were gradually taught many interesting anduseful facts about natural history. They learned to cultivate theirpowers of observation also by studying the heavens. From a study of thestars their tutor drew them on to an acquaintance with the compass the
comment408,telescope the magic lantern the magnet and the wonders of arithmetic.The stories of foreign lands were interspersed with others illustratingthe habits of society one for example told how a certain rich man wascured of the gout showing how while most of the diseases of the poororiginate in the want of food and necessaries the rich are generallythe victims of their own sloth and intemperance."Dear me" said Tommy on one occasion "what a number of accidentspeople are subject to in this world.""It is very true" said Mr. Barlow "but as that is the case it isnecessary to improve ourselves in every manner that we may be able tostruggle against them."TOMMY Indeed sir I begin to believe it is for when I was youngerthan I am now I remember I was always fretful and hurting myselfthough I had two or three people constantly to take care of me. Atpresent I seem quite another thing I do not mind falling down andhurting myself or cold or scarcely anything that happens.MR. BARLOW And which do you prefer--to be as you are now or as youwere beforeTOMMY As I am now a great deal sir for then I always had somethingor another the matter with me. At present I think I am ten timesstronger and healthier than ever I was in my life.All the same Tommy found it difficult at first to understand how peoplewho lived in countries where they had to undergo great hardships couldbe so attached to their own land as to prefer it to any other country inthe world. "I have" he said "seen a great many ladies and littlemisses at our house and whenever they were talking of the places wherethey should like to live I have always heard them say that they hatedthe country of all things though they were born and bred there."MR. BARLOW And yet there are thousands who bear to live in it all theirlives and have no desire to change. Should you Harry like to go tolive in some townHARRY Indeed sir I should not for then I must leave everything Ilove in the world.TOMMY And have you ever been in any large townHARRY Once I was in Exeter but I did not much like it. The housesseemed to me to stand too thick and close and then there are littlenarrow alleys where the poor live and the houses are so high that
comment409,neither light nor air can ever get to them. And they most of themappeared so dirty and unhealthy that it made my heart ache to look atthem. I went home the next day and never was better pleased in my life.When I came to the top of the great hill from which you have a prospectof our house I really thought I should have cried with joy. The fieldslooked all so pleasant and the very cattle when I went about to seethem all seemed glad that I was come home again.MR. BARLOW You see by this that it is very possible for people to likethe country and to be happy in it. But as to the fine young ladies youtalk of the truth is that they neither love nor would be contented inany place. It is no wonder they dislike the country where they findneither employment nor amusement. They wish to go to London becausethey there meet with numbers of people as idle and as frivolous asthemselves and these people assist each other to talk about trifles andto waste their time.TOMMY That is true sir really for when we have a great deal ofcompany I have often observed that they never talk about anything buteating or dressing or men and women that are paid to make faces at theplayhouse or a great room called Ranelagh where everybody goes to meettheir friends.Which discourse led on to a story of the ancient Spartans and theirsuperiority to the luxury-loving Persians._IV.--The Bull-Baiting_The time had now arrived when Tommy was by appointment to go home andspend some time with his parents. Mr. Barlow had been long afraid ofthis visit as he knew his pupil would meet a great deal of companythere who would give him impressions of a nature very different fromthose he had with so much assiduity been labouring to excite. Howeverthe visit was unavoidable and Mrs. Merton sent so pressing aninvitation for Harry to accompany his friend after having obtained theconsent of his father that Mr. Barlow with much regret took leave ofhis pupils.When the boys arrived at Mr. Merton's they were introduced into acrowded drawing-room full of the most elegant company which that part ofthe country afforded among whom were several young gentlemen and ladiesof different ages who had been purposely invited to spend their holidayswith Master Merton.As soon as Master Merton entered every tongue was let loose in hispraise. As to Harry he had the good fortune to be taken notice of bynobody except Mr. Merton who received him with great cordiality and aMiss Simmons who had been brought up by an uncle who endeavoured by ahardy and robust education to prevent in his niece that sickly delicacywhich is considered so great an ornament in fashionable life. Harry andthis young lady became great friends though to a considerable extentthey were the butt of the others.A lady who sat by Mrs. Merton asked her in a whisper loud enough to beheard all over the room whether indicating Harry that was the littleploughboy whom she had heard Mr. Barlow was attempting to bring up likea gentleman Mrs. Merton answered "Yes." "Indeed" said the lady "Ishould have thought so by his plebeian look and vulgar air. But Iwonder my dear madam that you will suffer your son who withoutflattery is one of the most accomplished children I ever saw withquite the air of fashion to keep such company."Whilst Tommy was being estranged from his friend by a constantsuccession of flattery from his elders and the example of others of hisown age Harry who never said any of those brilliant things that rendera boy the darling of the ladies and who had not that vivacity orrather impertinence which frequently passes for wit with superficialpeople paid the greatest attention to what was said to him and madethe most judicious observations upon subjects he understood. For this
comment410,reason Miss Simmons although much older and better informed receivedgreat satisfaction from conversing with him and thought him infinitelymore agreeable and sensible than any of the smart young gentlemen shehad hitherto seen.One morning the young gentlemen agreed to take a walk in the country.Harry went with them. As they walked across a common they saw a greatnumber of people moving forward towards a bull-baiting. Instantly theywere seized with a desire to see the diversion. One obstacle alonepresented itself. Their parents particularly Mrs. Merton had made thempromise to avoid every kind of danger. However all except Harry agreedto go insisting among themselves that there was no danger."Master Harry" said one "has not said a word. Surely he will not tellof us."Harry said he did not wish to tell but if he added he were asked hewould have to tell the truth.A quarrel followed in which Tommy struck his friend in the face withhis fist. This added to Tommy's recent conduct towards him caused thetears to start to Harry's eyes whereupon the others assailed him withcries of "Coward" "Blackguard" and so on. Master Mash went further andslapped him in the face. Harry though Master Mash's inferior in sizeand strength returned this by a punch and a fight ensued from whichthough severely punished himself Harry emerged the victor to beassailed with a chorus of congratulation from those who before wereloading him with taunts and outrages.The young gentlemen persisting in their intention to see thebull-baiting Harry followed at some distance deciding not to quit hisfriend till he had once more seen him in a place of safety. As ithappened the bull after disposing of his early tormentors broke loosewhen three fierce dogs were set upon it at once. In the stampede littleTommy fell right in the path of the infuriated animal and would havelost his life had not Harry with a courage and presence of mind abovehis years suddenly seized a prong which one of the fugitives haddropped and at the very moment when the bull was stopping to gore hisdefenceless friend advanced and wounded it in the flank. The bullturned and with redoubled rage made at his new assailant and it isprobable that notwithstanding his intrepidity Harry would have paidwith his own life the price of his assistance to his friend had not apoor negro whom he had helped earlier in the day come opportunely tohis aid and by his promptitude and address secured the animal.The gratitude of Mr. Merton for his son's escape was unbounded and evenMrs. Merton was ashamed of her disparaging remarks about Harry. As forTommy he went to his friend's home to seek reconciliation reflectingwith shame and contempt upon the ridiculous prejudices he had onceentertained.He had now learned to consider all men as his brethren not forgettingthe poor negro and that as he said it is much better to be usefulthan rich or fine.                                   DANIEL DEFOERobinson Crusoe      Daniel Defoe English novelist historian and pamphleteer     was born in 1660 or 1661 in London the son of James Foe a     butcher and only assumed the name of De Foe or Defoe in     middle life. He was brought up as a dissenter and became a     dealer in hosiery in the city. He early began to publish his     opinions on social and political questions and was an     absolutely fearless writer audacious and independent so that     he twice suffered imprisonment for his daring. The immortal
comment411,     "Robinson Crusoe" was published on April 25 1719. Defoe was     already fifty-eight years of age. It was the first English     work of fiction that represented the men and manners of its     own time as they were. It appeared in several parts and the     first part which is here epitomised was so successful that     no fewer than four editions were printed in as many months.     "Robinson Crusoe" was widely pirated and its authorship gave     rise to absurd rumours. Some claimed it had been written by     Lord Oxford in the Tower others that Defoe had appropriated     Alexander Selkirk's papers. The latter idea was only justified     inasmuch as the story was partly founded on Selkirk's     adventures and partly on Dampier's voyages. Defoe died on     April 26 1731._I.--I Go to Sea_I was born of a good family in the city of York where my father--aforeigner of Bremen--settled after having retired from business. Myfather had given me a competent share of learning and designed me forthe law but I would be satisfied in nothing but going to sea. My mindwas filled with thoughts of seeing the world and nothing could persuademe to give up my desire.At length on September 1 1651 I left home and went on board a shipbound for London. The ship was no sooner out of the Humber than the windbegan to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner and as Ihad never been at sea before I was most inexpressibly sick in body andterrified in mind. The next day however the wind abated and forseveral days the weather continued calm. My fears being forgotten andthe current of my desires returned I entirely forgot the vows to returnhome that I made in my distress.The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads and castanchor. Our troubles were not yet over however for a few days laterthe wind increased till it blew a terrible storm indeed. I began to seeterror in the faces even of the seamen themselves and as the captainpassed me I could hear him softly to himself say several times "Weshall be all lost"My horror of mind put me into such a condition that I can by no wordsdescribe it. The storm increased and the seamen every now and thencried out the ship would founder. One of the men cried out that we hadsprung a leak and all hands were called to the pumps but the waterincreasing in the hold it was apparent that the ship would founder. Wefired guns for help and a ship who had rid it out just ahead of usventured a boat out. It was with the utmost hazard the boat came nearus but at last we got all into it and got into shore though notwithout much difficulty and walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth.Having some money in my pocket I travelled to London and there gotacquainted with the master of a ship which traded on the coast ofGuinea. This captain taking a fancy to my conversation told me if Iwould make a voyage with him I might do some trading on my own account.I embraced the offer and went the voyage with him. With the help ofsome of my relations I raised 40 which I laid out in toys beads andsuch trifles as my friend the captain said were most in demand on theGuinea Coast. It was a prosperous voyage. It made me both a sailor and amerchant for my adventure yielded me on my return to London almost300 and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have sinceso completed my ruin.I was now set up as a Guinea trader and made up my mind to go the samevoyage again in the same ship but this was the unhappiest voyage everman made for as we were off the African shore we were surprised by aMoorish rover of Salee who gave chase with all sail. About three in theafternoon he came up with us and after a great fight we were forced to
comment412,yield and were carried all prisoners into the port of Salee where wewere sold as slaves.I was fortunate enough to fall into the hands of a master who treated mewith no little kindness. He frequently went fishing and as I wasdexterous in catching fish he never went without me. One day he sent meout with a Moor to catch fish for him. Then notions of deliverancedarted into my thoughts and I prepared not for fishing but for avoyage. When everything was ready we sailed away to thefishing-grounds. Purposely catching nothing I said we had better gofarther out. The Moor agreed and I ran the boat out near a leaguefarther then I brought to as if I would fish. Instead of that howeverI stepped forward and stooping behind the Moor took him by surpriseand tossed him overboard. He rose to the surface and called on me totake him in. For reply I presented a gun at him and told him if he camenearer the boat I would shoot him and that as the sea was calm hemight easily swim ashore. So he turned about and swam for the shoreand I make no doubt but he reached it with ease.About ten days afterwards as I was steering out to double a cape Icame in sight of a Portuguese ship. On coming nearer they hailed mebut I understood not a word. At last a Scotch sailor called to me and Ianswered I was an Englishman and had made my escape from the Moors ofSalee. They then bade me come on board and very kindly took me in withall my goods.We had a very good voyage to the Brazils and when we reached ourdestination the captain recommended me to an honest man who had a sugarplantation. Here I settled down for a while and learned the planting ofsugar. Then I took a piece of land and became a planter myself. Myaffairs prospered and had I continued in the station I was now in Ihad room for many happy things to have yet befallen me but I was stillto be the agent of my own miseries._II.--Lord of an Island and Alone_Some of my neighbours hearing that I had a knowledge of Guinea tradingproposed to fit out a vessel and send her to the coast of Guinea topurchase negroes to work in our plantations. I was well pleased with theidea and when they asked me to go to manage the trading part I forgotall the perils and hardships of the sea and agreed to go. A ship beingfitted out we set sail on September 1 1659.We had very good weather for twelve days but after crossing the lineviolent hurricanes took us and drove us out of the way of all humancommerce. In this distress one morning there was a cry of "Land" andalmost at the same moment the ship struck against a sandbank. We took toa boat and worked towards the land but before we could reach it araging wave came rolling astern of us and overset the boat. We were allthrown into the sea and out of fifteen who were on board none escapedbut myself. I managed somehow to scramble to shore and clambered upthe cliffs and sat me down on the grass half-dead. Night coming on meI took up my lodging in a tree.When I waked it was broad day the weather clear and the storm abated.What surprised me most was that in the night the ship had been liftedfrom the bank by the swelling tide and driven ashore almost as far asthe place where I had landed. I saw that if we had all kept on board wehad been all safe and I had not been so miserable as to be leftentirely destitute of all company as I now was.I swam out to the ship and found that her stern lay lifted up on thebank. All the ship's provisions were dry and being well disposed toeat I filled my pockets and ate as I went about other things for I hadno time to lose. We had several spare yards and planks and with these Imade a raft. I emptied three of the seamen's chests and let them downupon the raft and filled them with provisions. I also let down thecarpenter's chest and some arms and ammunition--all of which after
comment413,much labour I got safely to land.My next work was to view the country. Where I was I yet knew not butafter I had with great labour got to the top of a hill which rose upvery steep and high I saw my fate to my great affliction--_viz._ thatI was in an island uninhabited except by wild beasts.I now began to consider that I might yet get a great many things out ofthe ship which would be useful to me so every day at low water I wenton board and brought away something or other until I had the biggestmagazine that was ever laid up I believe for one man. I verilybelieve had the calm weather held I should have brought away the wholeship piece by piece but on the fourteenth day it blew a storm and nextmorning behold no more ship was to be seen. I must not forget that Ibrought on shore two cats and a dog. He was a trusty servant to me manyyears. I wanted nothing that he could fetch me nor any company. I onlywanted him to talk to me but that he could not do. Later I managed tocatch a parrot which did much to cheer my loneliness. I taught him tospeak and it would have done your heart good to have heard the pityingtones in which he used to say "Robin--poor Robin Crusoe"I now went in search of a place where to fix my dwelling. I found alittle plain on the side of a rising hill which was there as steep as ahouse-side so that nothing could come down on me from the top. On theside of this rock was a hollow space like the entrance of a cave beforewhich I resolved to pitch my tent. Before I set up my tent I drew ahalf-circle before the hollow place which extended backwards abouttwenty yards. In this half-circle I planted two rows of strong stakesdriving them into the ground like piles above five feet and a halfhigh and sharpened at the top. Then I took some pieces of cable I hadfound in the ship and laid them in rows one upon another between thestakes and this fence was so strong that neither man nor beast couldget into it or over it. The entrance I made to be by a short ladder togo over the top and when I was in I lifted the ladder after me.Inside the fence with infinite labour I carried all my richesprovisions ammunition and stores. And I made me a large tent also topreserve me from the rains. When I had done this I began to work my wayinto the rock. All the earth and stones I dug out I laid up within my
comment414,fence and thus I made me a cave just behind my tent which served melike a cellar.In the middle of my labours it happened that rummaging in my things Ifound a little bag with but husks of corn and dust in it. Wishing tomake use of the bag I shook it out on one side of my fortification. Itwas a little before the great rains that I threw this stuff away notremembering that I had thrown anything there about a month after I sawsome green stalks shooting up. I was perfectly astonished when after alittle longer time I saw ten or twelve ears of barley. I knew not howit came there. At last it occurred to me that I had shaken out the bagthere. Besides the barley there were also a few stalks of rice. Icarefully saved the ears of this corn you may be sure and resolved tosow them all again. When my corn was ripe I used a cutlass as a scytheand cut off the ears and rubbed them out with my hands. At the end ofmy harvesting I had nearly two bushels of rice and two bushels and ahalf of barley. I kept all this for seed and bore the want of breadwith patience.I soon found that I needed many things to make me comfortable. First Iwanted a chair and a table for without them I must live like a savage.So I set to work. I had never handled a tool in my life but I had asaw an axe and several hatchets and I soon learned to use them all.If I wanted a board I had to chop down a tree. From the trunk of thetree I cut a log of the length my board was to be. Then I split the logand with infinite labour hewed it flat till it was as thin as a board.I made myself a table and a chair out of short pieces of board and fromthe large boards I made some wide shelves. On these I laid my tools andother things.From time to time I made many useful things. From a piece of ironwoodcut in the forest with great labour I made a spade to dig with. Then Iwanted a pick-axe but for long I could not think how I was to get one.At length I made use of crowbars from the wreck. These I heated in thefire and little by little shaped them till I made a pick-axe properenough though heavy.At first I felt the need of baskets in which to carry things so I setto work as a basket-maker. It came to my mind that the twigs of the treewhence I cut my stakes might serve. I found them to my purpose as muchas I could desire and during the next rainy season I employed myselfin making a great many baskets. Though I did not finish them handsomelyyet I made them sufficiently serviceable.I had however one want greater than all the others--bread. My barleywas very fine the grains were large and smooth but before I could makebread I must grind the grains into flour. I spent many a day to find outa Stone to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar and could find none
comment415,nor were the rocks of the island of hardness sufficient. So I gave itover and rounded a great block of hard wood and with the help of fireand great labour made a hollow in it. I made a great heavy pestle ofthe wood called ironwood.The baking part was the next thing to be considered for first I hadno yeast. As to that there was no supplying the want so I did notconcern myself much about it. But for an oven I was indeed in greatpain. At length I found out an experiment for that also. I made someearthen vessels broad but not deep about two feet across and aboutnine inches deep. These I burned in the fire till they were as hard asnails and as red as tiles and when I wanted to bake I made a great fireupon a hearth which I paved with some square tiles of my own making.When the fire had all burned I drew the embers forward upon my hearthand let them be there till the hearth was very hot. My loaves beingready I swept the hearth and set them on the hottest part of it. Overeach loaf I placed one of the large earthen pots and drew the embersall round to keep in and add to the heat. And thus I baked my barleyloaves and became in a little time a good pastrycook into the bargain.It need not be wondered at if all these things took up most of the thirdyear of my abode in the island. I had now brought my state of life to bemuch easier than it was at first and I learned to look more upon thebright side of my condition and less on the dark.Had anyone in England met such a man as I was it must have frightenedthem or raised great laughter. On my head I wore a great highshapeless cap of goat's skin. Stockings and shoes I had none but I hadmade a pair of somethings I scarce knew what to call them to slip overmy legs a jacket with the skirts coming down to the middle of mythighs and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same completing myoutfit. I had a broad belt of goat's skin and in this I hung on oneside a saw on the other a hatchet. Under my arm hung two pouches forshot and powder at my back I carried my basket on my shoulder my gunand over my head a great clumsy goat's skin umbrella.A stoic would have smiled to have seen me at dinner. There was mymajesty prince and lord of the whole island. How like a king I dinedtoo all alone attended by my servants Poll my parrot as if he hadbeen my favourite was the only person permitted to talk to me. My olddog sat at my right hand and two cats on each side of the tableexpecting a bit from my hand as a mark of special favour._III.--The Footprint_It was my custom to make daily excursions to some part of the island.One day walking along the beach I was exceedingly surprised with theprint of a man's naked foot plainly impressed on the sand. I stood likeone thunderstruck. I listened I looked around but I could hear nothingnor see anything. I went up to a rising ground to look further I walkedbackwards and forwards on the shore but I could see only that oneimpression.I went to it again. There was exactly a foot--toes heel and every partof a foot. How it came thither I knew not but I hurried home lookingbehind me at every two or three steps and mistaking every bush andtree fancying every stump to be a man. I had no sleep that night butmy terror gradually wore off and after some days I ventured down to thebeach to take measure of the footprint by my own.I found it much larger This filled me again with all manner of fearsand when I went home I began to prepare against an attack. I got out mymuskets loaded them and went to an enormous amount of labour andtrouble--all because I had seen the print of a naked foot on the sand.There seemed to me then no labour too great no task too toilsome and Imade me a second fortification and planted a vast number of stakes onthe outside of my outer wall which grew and became a thick grove oftrees entirely concealing the place of my retreat and adding greatlyto my security.I had now been twenty-two years on the island and had grown soaccustomed to the place that had I felt myself secure from the attack
comment416,by savages I fancied I could have been contented to remain there till Idied of old age.For many months the perturbation of my mind was very great in the daygreat troubles overwhelmed me and in the night I dreamed often ofkilling savages. About two years after I first knew these fears I wassurprised one morning by seeing five canoes on the shore. I could nottell what to think of it so went and lay in my castle perplexed anddiscomforted. At length becoming very impatient I clambered up to thetop of the hill and perceived by the help of my perspective glass noless than thirty men dancing round a fire with barbarous gestures. WhileI was looking two miserable wretches were dragged from the boats. Onewas immediately knocked down while the other seeing himself a littleat liberty started away from them and ran along the sands directlytowards me. I was dreadfully frightened that I must acknowledge when Iperceived him run my way especially when as I thought I saw himpursued by the whole body. But my spirits began to recover when I foundthat but three men followed him and that he outstripped themexceedingly in running.Presently he came to a creek and making nothing of it plunged inlanded and ran on with exceeding strength. Two of the pursuers swam thecreek but the third went no farther and soon after went back again. Iimmediately took my two guns ran down the hill and clapped myself inthe way between the pursuers and the pursued hallooing aloud to himthat fled. Then rushing on the foremost of the pursuers I knocked himdown with the stock of my piece. The other stopped as if frightenedbut as I came nearer I perceived he was fitting a bow and arrow toshoot at me so I was then obliged to shoot at him first which I didand killed him.The poor savage who fled was so frightened with the noise of my piecethat he seemed inclined still to fly. I gave him all the signs ofencouragement I could think of and he came nearer kneeling down everyten or twelve steps. I took him up and made much of him and comfortedhim. Then beckoning him to follow me I took him to my cave on thefarther part of the island. Here having refreshed him I made signs forhim to lie down to sleep which the poor creature did. After he hadslumbered about half an hour he came out of the cave running to melaying himself down and setting my foot upon his head to let me know hewould serve me so long as he lived.In a little time I began to speak to him and teach him to speak to meand first I let him know his name should be Friday which was the dayI saved his life. I likewise taught him to say "Master" and then lethim know that was to be my name. I made a little tent for him and tookin my ladders at night so that he could no way come at me.But I needed not this precaution for never man had a more faithfulloving servant than Friday was to me. I made it my business to teach himeverything that was proper to make him useful especially to make himspeak and he was the aptest scholar that ever was. Indeed this was thepleasantest year of all the life I led in this place. I began now tohave some use for my tongue again and besides the pleasure of talkingto Friday I had a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself. Hissimple unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and more every day and Ibegan really to love the creature and I believe he loved me more thanit was possible for him ever to love anything before._IV.--The End of Captivity_I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my captivity on theisland. One morning I bade Friday go to the seashore and see if he couldfind a turtle. He had not been gone long when he came running back likeone that felt not the ground or the steps he set his feet on and criesout to me "O master O sorrow O bad""What's the matter Friday" said I."O yonder there" says he "one two three canoes""Well" says I "do not be frightened."
comment417,However I saw the poor fellow was most terribly scared for nothing ranin his head but that the savages were come back to look for him andwould cut him in pieces and eat him. I comforted him and told him I wasin as much danger as he. Then I went up the hill and found quickly by myglass that there were one-and-twenty savages whose business seemed tobe a triumphant banquet upon three human bodies. I came down again toFriday and going towards the wretches sent Friday a little ahead tosee what they were doing. He came back and told me that they were eatingthe flesh of one of their prisoners and that a bearded man lay boundwhom he said they would kill next.This fired the very soul within me and going to a little risingground I turned to Friday and said "Now Friday do exactly as you seeme do." So with a musket I took aim at the savages Friday did thelike and we fired killing three of them and wounding five more. Theywere in a dreadful consternation and after we fired again among theamazed wretches I made directly towards the poor victim who was lyingupon the beach. Loosing him I found he was a Spaniard. He took pistoland sword from me thankfully and flew upon his murderers and Fridaypursuing the flying wretches in the end but four of the twenty-oneescaped in a canoe.I was minded to pursue them lest they should return with a greater forceand devour us by mere multitude. So running to a canoe I bade Fridayfollow me but was surprised to find another poor creature lyingtherein bound hand and foot. I immediately cut his fastenings and badeFriday tell him of his deliverance. But when Friday came to hear himspeak and to look in his face it would have moved anyone to tears tohave seen how Friday kissed him embraced him hugged him crieddanced sung and then cried again. It was a good while before I couldmake him tell me what was the matter but when he came a little tohimself he told me it was his father. He sat down by the old man a longwhile and took his arms and ankles which were numbed with the bindingand chafed and rubbed them with his hands.My island was now peopled and I thought myself rich in subjects. TheSpaniard and the old savage had been with us about seven months sharingin our labours when being unable to keep means of deliverance out ofmy thoughts I gave them leave to go over in one of the canoes to themainland where some of the Spaniard's shipmates were cast away givingthem provisions sufficient for themselves and all the Spaniards foreight days.It was no less than eight days I had waited for their return when Fridaycame to me and called aloud "Master master they are come" I jumpedup and climbed to the top of the hill and with my glass plainly madeout an English ship and its long-boat standing in for the shore. Icannot express the joy I was in at seeing a ship and one that wasmanned by my own countrymen but yet I had some secret doubts biddingme keep on my guard. Presently the boat was run upon the beach and inall eleven men landed whereof three were unarmed and bound whom Icould perceive using passionate gestures of entreaty and despair.Presently the seamen were all gone straggling in the woods leaving thethree distressed men under a tree a little distance from me. I resolved
comment418,to discover myself to them and marched with Friday towards them andcalled aloud in Spanish "What are ye gentlemen" They started up atthe noise and I perceived them about to fly from me when I spoke tothem in English."Gentlemen" says I "do not be surprised at me perhaps you may have afriend near when you did not expect it. Can you not put a stranger inthe way to help you"One of them looking like one astonished returned "Sir I was captainof that ship my men have mutinied against me and have set me on shorein this desolate place with these two men--my mate and a passenger."He then told me that if two among the mutineers who were desperatevillains were secured he believed the rest on shore would return totheir duty. He anticipated my proposals in venturing their deliveranceby telling me that both he and the ship if recovered should be whollydirected by me in everything. Then I gave them muskets and themutineers returning the two villains were killed and the rest beggedfor mercy and joined us. More of them coming ashore we fell upon themat night so that at the captain's call they laid down their armstrusting to the mercy of the governor of the island for such theysupposed me to be.It now occurred to me that the time of my deliverance was come and thatit would be easy to bring these fellows in to be hearty in gettingpossession of the ship. And so it proved for the ship being boardednext morning and the new rebel captain shot the rest yielded withoutany more lives lost.When I saw my deliverance then put visibly into my hands I was ready tosink down with the surprise and it was a good while before I couldspeak a word to the captain who was in as great an ecstasy as I. Aftersome time I came dressed in a new habit of the captain's being stillcalled governor. Being all met and the captain with me I caused theprisoners to be brought before me told them I had got a full account oftheir villainous behaviour to the captain and asked of them what theyhad to say why I should not execute them as pirates. I told them I hadresolved to quit the island but that they if they went could only goas prisoners in irons so that I could not tell what was the best forthem unless they had a mind to take their fate in the island. Theyseemed thankful for this and said they would much rather venture tostay than be carried to England to be hanged. So I left it on thatissue. When the captain was gone I sent for the men up to me in myapartment and let them into the story of my living there showed them myfortifications the way I made my bread planted my corn and in aword all that was necessary to make them easy. I told them the storyalso of the Spaniards that were to be expected and made them promise totreat them in common with themselves.I left the next day and went on board the ship with Friday. And thus Ileft the island the 19th of December in the year 1686 after eight andtwenty years and after a long voyage I arrived in England the 11thof June 1687 having been thirty-five years absent.                                   Captain Singleton      Defoe was fifty-nine when he published this remarkable book     in 1720. "Robinson Crusoe" had appeared in the previous year     and "Moll Flanders" came out in 1722. Shrewdness and wit the     study of character vividness of imagination and beyond     these the pure literary style make "Captain Singleton" a     classic in English literature. William the Quaker the first     Quaker in English fiction has never been surpassed in any     later novel and remains an immortal creation. The clear     common sense of this man the combination of business ability     and a real humaneness the quiet humour which prevails over     the stupid barbarity of his pirate companions--who but Defoe     could have drawn such a character as the guide philosopher     and friend of a crew of pirates Bob Singleton himself who     tells the story with a frankness of extraordinary charm
comment419,     confessing his willingness for evil courses as readily as his     later repentance is no less striking a personality. By sheer     imagination the genius of Defoe makes Singleton's adventures     including the impossible journey across Central Africa real     and credible. The book is a model of fine narrative._I.--Sailing With the Devil_If I may believe the woman whom I was taught to call mother I was alittle boy about two years old very well dressed and had a nurse-maidto attend me who took me out on a fine summer's evening into the fieldstowards Islington to give the child some air a little girl being withher of twelve or fourteen years old that lived in the neighbourhood.The maid meets with a fellow her sweetheart he carries her into apublic-house and while they are toying in there the girl plays aboutwith me in her hand sometimes in sight sometimes out of sightthinking no harm.Then comes by one of those sort of people who make it their business tospirit away little children a trade chiefly practised where they foundlittle children well dressed and for bigger children to sell them tothe plantations.The woman pretending to take me up in her arms and play with me drawsthe girl a good way from the house and then bids her go back to themaid and tell her that a gentlewoman had taken a fancy to the child.And so while the girl went she carries me quite away.From that time it seems I was disposed of to a beggar woman and afterthat to a gipsy till I was about six years old.And this gipsy though I was continually dragged about with her from onepart of the country to the other never let me want for anything. Icalled her mother but she told me at last she was not my mother butthat she bought me for twelve shillings and that my name was BobSingleton not Robert but plain Bob.Who my father and mother really were I have never learnt.When my gipsy mother happened in process of time to be hanged I wassent to a parish school and then I was moved from one parish toanother and at Bussleton near Southampton the master of a ship took afancy to me and though I was not above twelve years old he carried meto sea with him on a voyage to Newfoundland.I went several voyages with him when coming home from Newfoundlandabout the year 1695 we were taken by an Algerine rover which was inits turn taken by two great Portuguese men-of-war.We were carried into Lisbon and there my master the only friend I hadin the world dying of his wounds I was left starving in a foreigncountry where I knew nobody and could not speak a word of the language.However an old pilot found me and speaking in broken English askedme if I would go with him."Yes" said I "with all my heart."For two years I lived with him and then he got to be master under DonGarcia de Carravallas captain of a Portuguese galleon which was boundto Goa in the East Indies. On this voyage I began to get a smattering ofthe Portuguese tongue and a superficial knowledge of navigation. I alsolearnt to be an arrant thief and a bad sailor.I was reputed as mighty diligent and faithful to my master but I wasvery far from honest.Indeed I had no sense of virtue or religion in me never having heardmuch of either and was growing up apace to be as wicked as anybodycould be.Thieving lying swearing forswearing joined to the most abominablelewdness was the stated practice of the ship's crew adding to it thatwith the most insufferable boasts of their own courage they weregenerally speaking the most complete cowards that I ever met with. AndI was exactly fitted for their society.According to the English proverb he that is shipped with the devil mustsail with the devil I was among them and I managed myself as well as I
comment420,could.When we came to anchor on the coast of Madagascar to repair some damageto the ship there happened a most desperate mutiny among the men uponaccount of a deficiency in their allowance and I being full ofmischief in my head readily joined.Though I was but a boy as they called me yet I prompted the mischiefall I could and embarked in it so openly that I escaped very littlebeing hanged in the first and most early part of my life.For the captain getting wind of the plot brought two fellows toconfess the particulars and presently no less than sixteen men wereseized and put into irons whereof I was one.The captain who was made desperate by his danger tried us all and wewere all condemned to die. The gunner and purser were hangedimmediately and I expected it with the rest. I do not remember anygreat concern I was under about it only that I cried very much for Iknew little then of this world and nothing at all of the next.However the captain contented himself with executing these two andsome of the rest upon their humble submission were pardoned but fivewere ordered to be set on shore on the island and left there of which Iwas one.At our first coming into the island we were terrified exceedingly withthe sight of the barbarous people but when we came to converse withthem awhile we found they were not cannibals as was reported but theycame and sat down by us and wondered much at our clothes and arms. Nordid we suffer any harm from them during our whole stay on the island.Before the ship sailed twenty-three of the crew decided to join us andthe captain not unwilling to lose them sent us two barrels of powderand shot and lead as well as a great bag of bread.Being now a considerable number and in condition to defend ourselvesthe first thing we did was to give everyone his hand that we would notseparate from one another but that we would live and die together thatwe would be in all things guided by the majority that we would appointa captain among us to be our leader and that we would obey him on painof death._II.--A Mad Venture_For two years we remained on the island of Madagascar for at thebeginning we had no vessel large enough to pass the ocean.I never proposed to speak in the general consultations but one day Itold the company that our best plan was to cruise along the coast incanoes and seize upon the first vessel we could get that was betterthan our own and so from that to another till perhaps we might at lastget a good ship to carry us wherever we pleased to go."Excellent advice" says one of them. "Admirable advice" says another."Yes yes" says the third which was a gunner "the English dog hasgiven excellent advice but it is just the way to bring us all to thegallows. To go a-thieving till from a little vessel we come to a greatship and so shall we turn downright pirates the end of which is to behanged.""You may call us pirates" says another "if you will and if we fallinto bad hands we may be used like pirates but I care not for that.I'll be a pirate or anything rather than starve here"And so they cried all "Let us have a canoe"The gunner overruled by the rest submitted but as we broke up thecouncil he came to me and very gravely. "My lad" says he "thou artborn to do a world of mischief thou hast commenced pirate very youngbut have a care of the gallows young man have a care I say for thouwilt be an eminent thief."I laughed at him and told him I did not know what I might come tohereafter but as our case was now I should make no scruple to take the
comment421,first ship I came at to get our liberty. I only wished we could see oneand come at her.When we had made three canoes of some size we set out on as odd avoyage as ever man went. We were a little fleet of three ships and anarmy of between twenty and thirty as dangerous fellows as ever lived. Wewere bound somewhere and nowhere for though we knew what we intended todo we really did not know what we were doing.We cruised up and down the coast but no ship came in sight and atlast with more courage than discretion more resolution than judgmentwe launched for the main coast of Africa.The voyage was much longer than we expected and when we were landedupon the continent it seemed the most desolate desert and inhospitablecountry in the world.It was here that we took one of the rashest and wildest and mostdesperate resolutions that ever was taken by man this was to traveloverland through the heart of the country from the coast of Mozambiqueto the coast of Angola or Guinea a continent of land of at least 1800miles in which journey we had excessive heats to support impassabledeserts to go over no carriages camels or beasts of any kind to carryour baggage innumerable wild and ravenous beasts to encounter such aslions leopards tigers lizards and elephants we had nations ofsavages to encounter barbarous and brutish to the last degree hungerand thirst to struggle with and in one word terrors enough to havedaunted the stoutest hearts that ever were placed in cases of flesh andblood.Yet fearless of all these we resolved to adventure and not only didwe accomplish our journey but we came to a river where there were vastquantities of gold.The hardships and difficulties of our march were much mitigated by amethod which I proposed and was found very convenient. This was toquarrel with some of the negro natives take them as prisoners andbinding them as slaves cause them to travel with us and make themcarry our baggage.Accordingly we secured about sixty lusty young fellows as prisonersfor the natives stood in great awe of us because of our firearms andthey not only served us faithfully--the more so as we treated themwithout harshness--but were of great help in showing us the way and inconversing with the savages we afterwards met.When we reached the country where the gold was we at once agreed inorder that the good harmony and friendship of our company might bemaintained that however much gold was gotten it should be brought intoone common stock and equally divided at last the negroes sharing withthe rest.This was done and at the end of our long journey we found each man'sshare amounted to many pounds of gold. We also got a cargo of elephants'teeth.We parted at the Gold Coast from our black companions on the best ofterms. Then most of my comrades went off to the Portuguese factoriesnear Gambia and I went to Cape Coast Castle and got passage forEngland where I arrived in September._III.--Quaker and Pirate_I had neither friend nor relation in England though it was my nativecountry I had not a person to trust with what I had or to counsel meto secure or save it but falling into ill company and trusting thekeeper of a public-house in Rotherhithe with a great part of my moneyall that great sum which I got with so much pains and hazard was gonein little more than two years' time--spent in all kinds of folly andwickedness.Then I began to see it was time to think of further adventures and Inext shipped myself in an evil hour to be sure on a voyage to Cadiz.On the coast of Spain I fell in with some masters of mischief andamong them one forwarder than the rest named Harris who began anintimate confidence with me so that we called one another brothers.
comment422,This Harris was afterwards captured by an English man-of-war and beinglaid in irons died of grief and anger.When we were together he asked me if I had a mind for an adventure thatmight make amends for all past misfortunes. I told him yes with all myheart for I did not care where I went having nothing to lose and noone to leave behind me.He told me then there was a brave fellow whose name was Wilmot inanother English ship which rode in the harbour who had resolved tomutiny the next morning and run away with the ship and that if wecould get strength enough among our ship's company we might do thesame.I liked the proposal very well but we could not bring our part toperfection. For there were but eleven in our ship who were in theconspiracy nor could we get any more that we could trust. So that whenWilmot began his work and secured the ship and gave the signal to uswe all took a boat and went off to join him.Being well prepared for all manner of roguery without the least checksof conscience I thus embarked with this crew which at last brought meto consort with the most famous pirates of the age.I that was an original thief and a pirate even by inclination beforewas now in my element and never undertook anything in my life with moreparticular satisfaction.Captain Wilmot--for so we now called him--at once stood out for seasteering for the Canaries and thence onward to the West Indies. Ourship had twenty-two guns and we obtained plenty of ammunition from theSpaniards in exchange for bales of English cloth.We cruised near two years in those seas of the West Indies chiefly uponthe Spaniards--not that we made any difficulty of taking English shipsor Dutch or French if they came in our way. But the reason why wemeddled as little with English vessels as we could was first becauseif they were ships of any force we were sure of more resistance fromthem and secondly because we found the English ships had less bootywhen taken for the Spaniards generally had money on board and that waswhat we best knew what to do with.We increased our stock considerably in these two years having taken60000 pieces of gold in one vessel and 100000 in another and beingthus first grown rich we resolved to be strong too for we had taken abrigantine an excellent sea-boat able to carry twelve guns and alarge Spanish frigate-built ship which afterwards by the help of goodcarpenters we fitted up to carry twenty-eight guns.We had also taken two or three sloops from New England and New Yorkladen with flour peas and barrelled beef and pork going for Jamaicaand Barbados and for more beef we went on shore on the island of Cubawhere we killed as many black cattle as we pleased though we had verylittle salt to cure them.Out of all the prizes we took here we took their powder and bulletstheir small-arms and cutlasses and as for their men we always took thesurgeon and the carpenter as persons who were of particular use to usupon many occasions nor were they always unwilling to go with us.We had one very merry fellow here a Quaker whose name was WilliamWalters whom we took out of a sloop bound from Pennsylvania toBarbados. He was a surgeon and they called him doctor and we made himgo with us and take all his implements with him. He was a comic fellowindeed a man of very good solid sense and an excellent surgeon butwhat was worth all very good-humoured and pleasant in his conversationand a bold stout brave fellow too as any we had among us.I found William not very averse to go along with us and yet resolved todo it so that it might be apparent he was taken away by force. "Friend"he says "thou sayest I must go with thee and it is not in my power toresist thee if I would but I desire thou wilt oblige the master of thesloop to certify under his hand that I was taken away by force andagainst my will." So I drew up a certificate myself wherein I wrotethat he was taken away by main force as a prisoner by a pirate ship
comment423,and this was signed by the master and all his men."Thou hast dealt friendly by me" says he when we had brought himaboard "and I will be plain with thee whether I came willingly to theeor not. But thou knowest it is not my business to meddle when thou artto fight.""No no" says the captain "but you may meddle a little when we sharethe money.""Those things are useful to furnish a surgeon's chest" says Williamand smiled "but I shall be moderate."In short William was a most agreeable companion but he had the betterof us in this part that if we were taken we were sure to be hanged andhe was sure to escape. But he was a sprightly fellow and fitter to becaptain than any of us._IV.--A Respectable Merchant_We cruised the seas for many years and after a time William and I had aship to ourselves with 400 men in authority under us. As for CaptainWilmot we left him with a large company at Madagascar while we went onto the East Indies.At last we had gotten so rich for we traded in cloves and spices to themerchants that William one day proposed to me that we should give upthe kind of life we had been leading. We were then off the coast ofPersia."Most people" said William "leave off trading when they are satisfiedof getting and are rich enough for nobody trades for the sake oftrading much less do men rob for the sake of thieving. It is naturalfor men that are abroad to desire to come home again at last especiallywhen they are grown rich and so rich as they would know not what to dowith more if they had it.""Well William" said I "but you have not explained what you mean byhome. Why man I am at home here is my habitation I never had anyother in my lifetime I was a kind of charity school-boy so that I canhave no desire of going anywhere for being rich or poor for I havenowhere to go.""Why" says William looking a little confused "hast thou no relativesor friends in England No acquaintance none that thou hast any kindnessor any remains of respect for""Not I William" said I "no more than I have in the court of the GreatMogul. Yet I do not say I like this roving cruising life so well asnever to give it over. Say anything to me I will take it kindly." For Icould see he was troubled and I began to be moved by his gravity."There is something to be thought of beyond this way of life" saysWilliam."Why what is that" said I "except it be death""It is repentance.""Why" says I "did you ever know a pirate repent"At this he was startled a little and returned."At the gallows I have known one and I hope thou wilt be the second."He spoke this very affectionately with an appearance of concern for me."My proposal" William went on "is for thy good as well as my own. Wemay put an end to this kind of life and repent.""Look you William" says I "let me have your proposal for putting anend to our present way of living first and you and I will talk of theother afterwards.""Nay" says William "thou art in the right there we must never talk ofrepenting while we continue pirates.""Well" says I "William that's what I meant for if we must notreform as well as be sorry for what is done I have no notion whatrepentance means the nature of the thing seems to tell me that thefirst step we have to take is to break off this wretched course. Dostthou think it practicable for us to put an end to our unhappy way ofliving and get off""Yes" says he "I think it very practicable."We were then anchored off the city of Bassorah and one night Williamand I went ashore and sent a note to the boatswain telling him we werebetrayed and bidding him make off with the ship.By this means we frighted the rogues our comrades and we had nothing todo then but to consider how to convert our treasure into things properto make us look like merchants as we were now to be and not likefreebooters as we really had been.Then we clothed ourselves like Armenian merchants and after many daysreached Venice and at last we agreed to go to London. For William had a
comment424,sister whom he was anxious to see once more.So we came to England and some time later I married William's sisterwith whom I am much more happy than I deserve.                                   CHARLES DICKENSBarnaby Rudge      Charles Dickens son of a clerk in the Navy Pay Office was     born at Landport on February 7 1812. Soon afterwards the     family removed to Chatham and then to London. With all their     efforts they failed to keep out of distress and at the age     of nine Dickens was employed at a blacking factory. With the     coming of brighter days he was sent back to school     afterwards a place was found for him in a solicitor's office.     In the meantime his father had obtained a position as     reporter on the "Morning Herald" and Dickens too resolved     to try his fortune in that direction. Teaching himself     shorthand and studying diligently at the British Museum at     the age of twenty-two he secured permanent employment on the     staff of a London paper. "Barnaby Rudge" the fifth of     Dickens's novels appeared serially in "Master Humphrey's     Clock" during 1841. It thus followed "The Old Curiosity Shop"     the character of Master Humphrey being revived merely to     introduce the new story and on its conclusion "The Clock" was     stopped for ever. In 1849 "Barnaby Rudge" was published in     book form. Written primarily to express the author's     abhorrence of capital punishment from the use he made of the     Gordon Riots of 1780 "Barnaby Rudge" like "A Tale of Two     Cities" may be considered an historical work. It is more of a     story than any of its predecessors. Lord George Gordon the     instigator of the riots died a prisoner in the Tower of     London after making public renunciation of Christianity in     favour of the Jewish religion. "The raven in this story" said     Dickens "is a compound of two originals of whom I have been     the proud possessor." Dickens died at Gad's Hill on June 9     1870 having written fourteen novels and a great number of     short stories and sketches._I.--Barnaby and the Robber_In the year 1775 there stood upon the borders of Epping Forest in the
comment425,village of Chigwell about twelve miles from London a house of publicentertainment called the Maypole kept by John Willet a large-headedman with a fat face of profound obstinacy and slowness of apprehensioncombined with a very strong reliance upon his own merits.From this inn Gabriel Varden stout-hearted old locksmith ofClerkenwell jogged steadily home on a chaise half sleeping and halfwaking on a certain rough evening in March.A loud cry roused him with a start just where London begins and hedescried a man extended in an apparently lifeless state wounded upon thepathway and hovering round him another person with a torch in hishand which he waved in the air with a wild impatience."What's here to do" said the old locksmith. "How's this What BarnabyYou know me Barnaby"The bearer of the torch nodded not once or twice but a score of timeswith a fantastic exaggeration."How came it here" demanded Varden pointing to the body."Steel steel steel" Barnaby replied fiercely imitating the thrust ofa sword."Is he robbed" said the blacksmith.Barnaby caught him by the arm and nodded "Yes" pointing towards thecity."Oh" said the old man. "The robber made off that way did he Now let'ssee what can be done."They covered the wounded man with Varden's greatcoat and carried him toMrs. Rudge's house hard by. On his way home Gabriel congratulatedhimself on having an adventure which would silence Mrs. Varden on thesubject of the Maypole for that night or there was no faith in woman.But Mrs. Varden was a lady of uncertain temper and she was on thisoccasion so ill-tempered and put herself to so much anxiety andagitation aided and abetted by her shrewish hand-maiden Miggs thatnext morning she was she said too much indisposed to rise. Thedisconsolate locksmith had therefore to deliver himself of his storyof the night's experiences to his daughter buxom bewitching Dolly thevery pink and pattern of good looks and the despair of the youth of theneighbourhood.Calling next day in the evening Gabriel Varden learnt the wounded manwas better and would shortly be removed.Varden chatted as an old friend with Barnaby's mother. He knew theMaypole story of the widow Rudge--how her husband employed at Chigwelland his master had been murdered and how her son born upon the veryday the deed was known bore upon his wrist a smear of blood but halfwashed out."Why what's that" said the locksmith suddenly. "Is that Barnabytapping at the door""No" returned the widow "it was in the street I think. Hark 'Tissomeone knocking softly at the shutter.""Some thief or ruffian" said the locksmith. "Give me a light.""No no" she returned hastily. "I would rather go myself alone."She left the room and Varden heard the sound of whispers without. Thenthe words "My God" came tittered in a voice dreadful to hear.Varden rushed out. A look of terror was on the woman's face and beforeher stood a man of sinister appearance whom the locksmith had passedon the road from Chigwell the previous night.The man fled but the locksmith was after him and would have held himbut for the widow who clutched his arms."The other way--the other way" she cried. "Do not touch him on yourlife He carries other lives besides his own. Don't ask what it means.He is not to be followed or stopped Come back""The other way" said the locksmith. "Why there he goes"The old man looked at her in wonder and let her draw him into thehouse. Still that look of terror was on her face as she implored himnot to question her.Presently she withdrew and left him in his perplexity alone andBarnaby came in."I have been asleep" said the idiot with widely opened eyes. "Therehave been great faces coming and going--close to my face and then amile away. That's sleep eh I dreamed just now that something--it wasin the shape of a man--followed me and wouldn't let me be. It camecreeping on to worry me nearer and nearer. I ran faster leaped sprang
comment426,out of bed and to the window and there in the street below--""Halloa halloa halloa Bow wow wow" cried a hoarse voice. "What'sthe matter here Halloa"The locksmith started and there was Grip a large raven Barnaby'sclose companion perched on the top of a chair."Halloa halloa halloa Keep up your spirits Never say die" the birdwent on in a hoarse voice. "Bow wow wow" And then he began towhistle.The locksmith said "Good-night" and went his way home disturbed inthought."In league with that ill-looking figure that might have fallen from agibbet. He listening and hiding here. Barnaby first upon the spot lastnight. Can she who has always borne so fair a name be guilty of suchcrimes in secret" said the locksmith musing. "Heaven forgive me if Iam wrong and send me just thoughts."_II--Barnaby Is Enrolled_It is seven in the forenoon on June 2 1780 and Barnaby and hismother who had travelled to London to escape that unwelcome visitorwhom Varden had noticed were resting in one of the recesses ofWestminster Bridge.A vast throng of persons were crossing the river to the Surrey shore inunusual haste and excitement and nearly every man in this greatconcourse wore in his hat a blue cockade.When the bridge was clear which was not till nearly two hours hadelapsed the widow inquired of an old man what was the meaning of thegreat assemblage."Why haven't you heard" he returned. "This is the day Lord GeorgeGordon presents the petition against the Catholics and his lordship hasdeclared he won't present it to the House of Commons at all unless it isattended to the door by forty thousand good men and true at least.There's a crowd for you""A crowd indeed" said Barnaby. "Do you hear that mother That's abrave crowd he talks of. Come""Not to join it" cried his mother. "You don't know what mischief theymay do or where they may lead you. Dear Barnaby for my sake----""For your sake" he answered. "It _is_ for your sake mother. Here's abrave crowd Come--or wait till I come back Yes yes wait here"A stranger gave Barnaby a blue cockade and bade him wear it and whilehe was still fixing it in his hat Lord Gordon and his secretaryGashford passed and then turned back."You lag behind friend and are late" said Lord George. "It's past tennow. Didn't you know the hour of assemblage was ten o'clock"
comment427,Barnaby shook his head and looked vacantly from one to the other."He cannot tell you sir" the widow interposed. "It's no use to askhim. We know nothing of these matters. This is my son--my poorafflicted son dearer to me than my own life. He is not in his rightsenses--he is not indeed.""He has surely no appearance" said Lord George whispering in hissecretary's ear "of being deranged. We must not construe any triflingpeculiarity into madness. You desire to make one of this body" headded addressing Barnaby. "And intended to make one did you""Yes yes" said Barnaby with sparkling eyes. "To be sure I did. Itold her so myself.""Then follow me." replied Lord George "and you shall have your wish."Barnaby kissed his mother tenderly and telling her their fortunes weremade now did as he was desired.They hastened on to St. George's Fields where the vast army of men wasdrawn up in sections. Doubtless there were honest zealots sprinkled hereand there but for the most part the throng was composed of the veryscum and refuse of London.Barnaby was acclaimed by a man in the ranks Hugh the rough hostler ofthe Maypole whom Barnaby in his frequent wanderings had long known."What you wear the colour do you Fall in Barnaby. You shall marchbetween me and Dennis and you shall carry" said Hugh taking a flagfrom the hand of a tired man "the gayest silken streamer in thisvaliant army.""In the name of God no" shrieked the widow who had followed inpursuit and now darted forward. "Barnaby my lord he'll comeback--Barnaby""Women in the field" cried Hugh stepping between them and holding heroff with his outstretched hand. "It's against all orders--ladiescarrying off our gallant soldiers from their duty. Give the word ofcommand captain."The words "Form March" rang out.She was thrown to the ground the whole field was in motion Barnaby waswhirled away into the heart of a dense mass of men and the widow sawhim no more.Barnaby himself heedless of the weight of the great banner he carriedmarched proud happy and elated past all telling. Hugh was at his sideand next to Hugh came a squat thick-set personage called Dennis whounknown to his companions was no other than the public hangman."I wish I could see her somewhere" said Barnaby looking anxiouslyaround. "She would be proud to see me now eh Hugh She'd cry with joyI know she would.""Why what palaver's this" asked Mr. Dennis with supreme disdain. "Weain't got no sentimental members among us I hope.""Don't be uneasy brother" cried Hugh "he's only talking of hismother.""His mother" growled Mr. Dennis with a strong oath and in tones ofdeep disgust. "And have I combined myself with this here section andturned out on this here memorable day to hear men talk about theirmothers""Barnaby's right" cried Hugh with a grin "and I say it. Lookee boldlad if she's not here to see it's because I've provided for her andsent half-a-dozen gentlemen every one of 'em with a blue flag to takeher to a grand house all hung round with gold and silver banners whereshe'll wait till you come and want for nothing. And we'll get moneyfor her. Money cocked hats and gold lace will all belong to us if weare true to that noble gentleman if we carry our flags and keep 'emsafe. That's all we've got to do."Don't you see man" Hugh whispered to Dennis "that the lad's anatural and can be got to do anything if you take him the right wayHe's worth a dozen men in earnest as you'd find if you tried a fallwith him. You'll soon see whether he's of use or not."Mr. Dennis received this explanation with many nods and winks andsoftened his behaviour towards Barnaby from that moment.Hugh was right. It was Barnaby who stood his ground and grasped hispole more firmly when the Guards came out to clear the mob away fromWestminster.One soldier came spurring on cutting at the hands of those who wouldhave forced his charger back and still Barnaby without retreating aninch waited for his coming. Some called to him to fly when the poleswept the air above the people's heads and the man's saddle was emptyin an instant.Then he and Hugh turned and fled the crowd opening and closing so
comment428,quickly that there was no clue to the course they had taken._III.--The Storming of Newgate_For several days London was in the hands of the rioters. Catholicchapels were burned the private residences of Catholics were sacked.From the moment of the first outbreak at Westminster every symptom oforder vanished. Fifty resolute men might have turned the rioters asingle company of soldiers could have scattered them like dust but noman interposed no authority restrained them.But Barnaby bold Barnaby had been taken. Left behind at the resort ofthe rioters by Hugh who led a body of men to Chigwell he had beencaptured by the soldiers a proclamation of the Privy Council having atlast encouraged the magistrates to set the military in motion for thearrest of certain ringleaders.He was placed in Newgate and heavily ironed and presently Grip withdrooping head and plumes rough and tumbled was thrust into his cell.Another man was also taken and placed in Newgate on that day andpresently he and Barnaby stood staring at each other face to face.Suddenly Barnaby laid hands upon him and cried "Ah I know You arethe robber"The other struggled with him silently but finding the young man toostrong for him raised his eyes and said "I am your father."Barnaby released his hold fell back and looked at him aghast. Then hesprang towards him put his arms about his neck and pressed his headagainst his cheek. He never learnt that his father supposed to havebeen murdered was himself a murderer. This was the widow's dreadfulsecret.And now Hugh with a huge army was at the gates of Newgate bent onrescue. He had returned to find Barnaby taken and at once announcedthat the prison must be stormed. In vain the military commanders triedto rouse the magistrates and in particular the Lord Mayor no orderswere given and the soldiers could do nothing within the precincts ofthe city without the warrant of the civil authorities.In a dense mass the rioters halted before the prison-gate. All those whohad already been conspicuous were there and others who had friends orrelatives within the jail hastened to the attack.Hugh had brought by force old Gabriel Varden to pick the lock of thegreat door but this the sturdy locksmith resolutely refused to do."You have got some friends of ours in your custody master" Hugh calledout to the head jailer who had appeared on the roof. "Deliver up ourfriends and you may keep the rest.""It's my duty to keep them all. I shall do my duty" replied the jailerfirmly.A shower of stones compelled the keeper of the jail to retire.Gabriel Varden was urged by blows by offers of reward and by threatsof instant death to do the office the rioters required of him and allin vain. He was knocked down was up again buffeting with a score of
comment429,them. He had never loved his life so well as then but nothing couldmove him.The cry was raised "You lose time. Remember the prisoners RememberBarnaby" And the crowd left the locksmith to gather fuel for anentrance was to be forced by fire. Furniture from the prison lodge waspiled up in a monstrous heap and set blazing oil was poured on and atlast the great gate yielded to the flames. It settled deeper in thered-hot cinders tottered and was down.Hugh leaped upon the blazing heap and dashed into the jail. The hangmanfollowed. And then so many rushed upon their track that the fire gottrodden down. There was no need of it now for inside and out theprison was soon in flames.Barnaby and his father were quickly released and passed from hand tohand into the street. Soon all the wretched inmates of the jail werefree except four condemned to die whom Dennis kept under guard. Andthese Hugh roughly insisted on liberating to the sullen anger of thehangman."You won't let these men alone and leave 'em to me You've no respectfor nothing haven't you" said Dennis and with a scowl he disappeared.Three hundred prisoners in all were released from Newgate and many ofthese returned to haunt the place of their captivity and were retaken.The day after the storming of Newgate the mob having now had London atits mercy for a week the authorities at last took serious action andat nightfall the military held the streets.Hugh and Barnaby and old Rudge had taken refuge in a rough out-house inthe outskirts of London where they were wont to rest when Dennis stoodbefore them he had not been seen since the storming of Newgate.A few minutes later and the shed was filled with soldiers while a bodyof horse galloping into the field drew op before it."Here" said Dennis "it's them two young ones gentlemen that theproclamation puts a price on. This other's an escaped felon. I'm sorryfor it brother" he added addressing himself to Hugh "but you'vebrought it on yourself you forced me to do it you wouldn't respect thesoundest constitutional principles you know you went and wiolated thewery framework of society."Barnaby and his father were carried off by one road in the centre of abody of foot-soldiers Hugh fast bound upon a horse was taken byanother._IV.--The Fate of the Rioters_The riots had been stamped out and once more the city was quiet.Barnaby sat in his dungeon. Beside him with his hand in hers sat hismother worn and altered full of grief and heavy-hearted but the sameto him.
comment430,"Mother" he said "how long--how many days and nights--shall I be kepthere""Not many dear. I hope not many.""If they kill me--they may I heard it said--what will become of Grip"The sound of the word suggested to the raven his old phrase "Never saydie" But he stopped short in the middle of it as if he lacked the heartto get through the shortest sentence."Will they take his life as well as mine" said Barnaby. "I wish theywould. If you and I and he could die together there would be none tofeel sorry or to grieve for us. Don't you cry for me. They said that Iam bold and so I am and so I will be."The turnkey came to close the cells for the night the widow toreherself away and Barnaby was alone.He was to die. There was no hope. They had tried to save him. Thelocksmith had carried petitions and memorials to the fountain-head withhis own hands. But the well was not one of mercy and Barnaby was todie. From the first his mother had never left him save at night andwith her beside him he was contented."They call me silly mother. They shall see--to-morrow."Dennis and Hugh were in the courtyard. "No reprieve no reprieve Nobodycomes near us. There's only the night left now" moaned Dennis. "Do youthink they'll reprieve me in the night brother I've known reprievescome in the night afore now. Don't you think there's a good chance yetDon't you Say you do.""You ought to be the best instead of the worst" said Hugh stoppingbefore him. "Ha ha ha See the hangman when it comes home to him."The clock struck. Barnaby looked in his mother's face and saw that thetime had come. After a long embrace he rushed away and they carried heraway insensible."See the hangman when it comes home to him" cried Hugh as Dennisstill moaning fell down in a fit. "Courage bold Barnaby what care weA man can die but once. If you wake in the night sing that out lustilyand fall asleep again."The time wore on. Five o'clock had struck--six--seven--and eight. Theywere to die at noon and in the crowd without it was said they couldtell the hangman when he came out by his being the shorter one andthat the man who was to suffer with him was named Hugh and that it wasBarnaby Rudge who would be hanged in Bloomsbury Square.At the first stroke of twelve the prison bell began to toll and thethree were brought forth into the yard together.Barnaby was the only one who had washed or trimmed himself that morning.He still wore the broken peacock's feathers in his hat and all hisusual scraps of finery were carefully disposed about his person."What cheer Barnaby" cried Hugh. "Don't be downcast lad. Leave thatto _him_" he added with a nod in the direction of Dennis held upbetween two men."Bless you" cried Barnaby "I'm not frightened Hugh. I'm quite happy.Look at me Am I afraid to die Will they see _me_ tremble""I'd say this" said Hugh wringing Barnaby by the hand and looking
comment431,round at the officers and functionaries gathered in the yard "that if Ihad ten lives to lose I'd lay them all down to save this one. This onethat will be lost through mine""Not through you" said Barnaby mildly. "Don't say that. You were not toblame. You have always been very good to me. Hugh we shall know whatmakes the stars shine _now_"Hugh spoke no more but moved onward in his place with a careless airlistening as he went to the service for the dead. As soon as he hadpassed the door his miserable associate was carried out and the crowdbeheld the rest. Barnaby would have mounted the steps at the same timebut he was restrained as he was to undergo the sentence elsewhere.It was only just when the cart was starting that the courier reached thejail with the reprieve. All night Gabriel Varden and his friends hadbeen at work they had gone to the young Prince of Wales and even tothe ante-chamber of the king himself. Successful at last in awakeningan interest in his favour they had an interview with the minister inhis bed as late as eight o'clock that morning. The result of a searchinginquiry was that between eleven and twelve o'clock a free pardon toBarnaby Rudge was made out and signed and Gabriel Varden had thegrateful task of bringing him home in triumph with an enthusiastic mob."I needn't say" observed the locksmith when his house in Clerkenwellwas reached at last and he and Barnaby were safe within "that exceptamong ourselves _I_ didn't want to make a triumph of it. But directlywe got into the street we were known and the hub-bub began. Of thetwo and after experience of both I think I'd rather be taken out of myhouse by a crowd of enemies than escorted home by a mob of friends"At last the crowd dispersed. And Barnaby stretched himself on the groundbeside his mother's couch and fell into a deep sleep.                                   Bleak House      "Bleak House" a story with a purpose like most of Dickens's     works was published when the author was forty years old. The     object of the story was to ventilate the monstrous injustice     wrought by delays in the old Court of Chancery which defeated     all the purposes of a court of justice. Many of the     characters who though famous are not essential to the     development of the story were drawn from real life.     Turveydrop was suggested by George IV. and Inspector Bucket     was a friend of the author in the Metropolitan Police Force.     Harold Skimpole was identified with Leigh Hunt. Dickens     himself admitted the resemblance but only in so far as none     of Skimpole's vices could be attributed to his prototype. The     original of Bleak House was a country mansion in     Hertfordshire near St. Albans though it is usually said to     be a summer residence of the novelist at Broadstairs._I.--In Chancery_London. Implacable November weather. The Lord Chancellor sitting inLincoln's Inn Hall. Fog everywhere and at the very heart of the fogsits the Lord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery. The case ofJarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. No man alive knows what it means. Ithas passed into a joke. It has been death to many but it is a joke inthe profession.Mr. Kenge of Kenge and Carboy solicitors Lincoln's Inn firstmentioned Jarndyce and Jarndyce to me and told me that the costsalready amounted to from sixty to seventy thousand pounds.My godmother who brought me up was just dead and Mr. Kenge came totell me that Mr. Jarndyce proposed knowing my desolate position that I
comment432,should go to a first-rate school where my education should be completedand my comfort secured. What did I say to this What could I say butaccept the proposal thankfullyI passed at this school six happy quiet years and then one day came anote from Kenge and Carboy mentioning that their client Mr. Jarndycebeing in the house desired my services as an eligible companion to thisyoung lady.So I said good-bye to the school and went to London and was driven toMr. Kenge's office. He was not altered but he was surprised to see howaltered I was and appeared quite pleased."As you are going to be the companion of the young lady who is now inthe Chancellor's private room Miss Summerson" he said "we thought itwell that you should be in attendance also."Mr. Kenge gave me his arm and we went out of his office and into thecourt and then into a comfortable sort of room where a young lady and ayoung gentleman were standing talking.They looked up when I came in and I saw in the young lady a beautifulgirl with rich golden hair and a bright innocent trusting face."Miss Ada" said Mr. Kenge "this is Miss Summerson."She came to meet me with a smile of welcome and her hand extended butseemed to change her mind in a moment and kissed me.The young gentleman was her distant cousin she told me and his nameRichard Carstone. He was a handsome youth and after she had called himup to where we sat he stood by us talking gaily like a light-heartedboy. He was very young not more than nineteen then but nearly twoyears older than she was. They were both orphans and had never metbefore that day. Our all three coming together for the first time insuch an unusual place was a thing to talk about and we talked about it.Presently we heard a bustle and Mr. Kenge said that the court hadrisen and soon after we all followed him into the next room. There wasthe Lord Chancellor sitting in an armchair at the table and his mannerwas both courtly and kind."Miss Clare" said his lordship. "Miss Ada Clare" Mr. Kenge presentedher."The Jarndyce in question" said the Lord Chancellor turning overpapers "is Jarndyce of Bleak House--a dreary name.""But not a dreary place my lord" said Mr. Kenge."Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House is not married" said his lordship."He is not my lord" said Mr. Kenge."Young Mr. Richard Carstone is present" said the Lord Chancellor.Richard bowed and stepped forward."Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House my lord" Mr. Kenge observed "if I mayventure to remind your lordship provides a suitable companion for----""For Mr. Richard Carstone" I thought I heard his lordship say in a lowvoice."For Miss Ada Clare. This is the young lady Miss Esther Summerson.""Miss Summerson is not related to any party in the cause I think.""No my lord.""Very well" said his lordship after taking Miss Ada aside and askingher if she thought she would be happy at Bleak House. "I shall make theorder. Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House has chosen so far as I may judge a
comment433,very good companion for the young lady and the arrangement seems thebest of which the circumstances admit."He dismissed us pleasantly and we all went out. As we stood for aminute waiting for Mr. Kenge a curious little old woman Miss Flitein a squeezed bonnet and carrying a reticule came curtsying andsmiling up to us with an air of great ceremony."Oh" said she "The wards in Jarndyce. Very happy I am sure to havethe honour. It is a good omen for youth and hope and beauty when theyfind themselves in this place and don't know what's to come of it.""Mad" whispered Richard not thinking she could hear him."Right Mad young gentleman" she returned quickly. "I was a wardmyself. I was not mad at that time. I had youth and hope I believebeauty. It matters very little now. Neither of the three served orsaved me. I have the honour to attend court regularly. I expect ajudgment. On the Day of Judgment. I have discovered that the sixth sealmentioned in the Revelations is the great seal. Pray accept myblessing."Mr. Kenge coming up the poor old lady went on. "I shall confer estateson both. Shortly. On the Day of Judgment. This is a good omen for you.Accept my blessing."We left her at the bottom of the stairs. She was still saying with acurtsy and a smile between every little sentence "Youth. And hope. Andbeauty. And Chancery."The morning after walking out early we met the old lady again smilingand saying in her air of patronage "The wards in Jarndyce Ve-ry happyI am sure Pray come and see my lodgings. It will be a good omen for me.Youth and hope and beauty are very seldom there."She took my hand and beckoned Richard and Ada to come too and in a fewmoments she was at home.She had stopped at a shop over which was written "Krook Rag and BottleWarehouse." Inside was an old man in spectacles and a hair cap andentering the shop the little old lady presented him to us."My landlord Krook" she said. "He is called among the neighbours theLord Chancellor. His shop is called the Court of Chancery."She lived at the top of the house in a room from which she had a glimpseof the roof of Lincoln's Inn Hall and this seemed to be her principalinducement for living there._II.--Bleak House_We drove down to Bleak House in Hertfordshire next day and all threeof us were anxious and nervous when the night closed in and the driverpointing to a light sparkling on the top of a hill cried "That's BleakHouse""Ada my love Esther my dear you are welcome. Rick if I had a hand
comment434,to spare at present I would give it you"The gentleman who said these words in a clear hospitable voice kissedus both in a fatherly way and bore us across the hall into a ruddylittle room all in a glow with a blazing fire."Now Rick" said he "I have a hand at liberty. A word in earnest is asgood as a speech. I am heartily glad to see you. You are at home. Warmyourself"While he spoke I glanced at his face. It was a handsome face full ofchange and motion and his hair was a silvered iron grey. I took him tobe nearer sixty than fifty but he was upright hearty and robust.So this was our coming to Bleak House.The very next morning I was installed as housekeeper and presented withtwo bunches of keys--a large bunch for the housekeeping and a littlebunch for the cellars. I could not help trembling when I met Mr.Jarndyce for I knew it was he who had done everything for me since mygodmother's death."Nonsense" he said. "I hear of a good little orphan girl without aprotector and I take it into my head to be that protector. She growsup and more than justifies my good opinion and I remain her guardianand her friend. What is there in all this"He soon began to talk to me confidentially as if I had been in the habitof conversing with him every morning for I don't know how long."Of course Esther" he said "you don't understand this Chancerybusiness"I shook my head."I don't know who does" he returned. "The lawyers have twisted it intosuch a state of bedevilment that the original merits of the case havelong disappeared. Its about a will and the trusts under a will--or itwas once. It's about nothing but costs now. It was about a will when itwas about anything. A certain Jarndyce in an evil hour made a greatfortune and made a great will. In the question how the trusts under thatwill are to be administered the fortune left by the will is squanderedaway the legatees under the will are reduced to such a miserablecondition that they would be sufficiently punished if they had committedan enormous crime in having money left them and the will itself is madea dead letter. All through the deplorable cause everybody must havecopies over and over again of everything that has accumulated about itin the way of cartloads of papers and must go down the middle and upagain through such an infernal country-dance of costs and fees andnonsense and corruption as was never dreamed of in the wildest visionsof a witch's sabbath. And we can't get out of the suit on any terms forwe are made parties to it and _must be_ parties to it whether we likeit or not. But it won't do to think of it Thinking of it drove my
comment435,great-uncle poor Tom Jarndyce to blow his brains out.""I hope sir--" said I."I think you had better call me Guardian my dear.""I hope Guardian" said I giving the housekeeping keys the least shakein the world "that you may not be trusting too much to my discretion. Iam not clever and that's the truth.""You are clever enough to be the good little woman of our lives here mydear" he returned playfully "the little old woman of the rhyme whosweeps the cobwebs of the sky and you will sweep them out of _our_ skyin the course of your housekeeping Esther."This was the beginning of my being called Old Woman and Mother Hubbardand Dame Durden and so many names of that sort that my own soon becamequite lost.One of the things I noticed from the first about my guardian was thatthough he was always doing a thousand acts of kindness he could notbear any acknowledgments.We had somehow got to see more of Miss Flite on our visits to Londonfor the Lord Chancellor always had to be consulted before Richard couldsettle in any profession and as Richard first wanted to be a doctor andthen tired of that in favour of the army there were severalconsultations. I remember one visit because it was the first time we metMr. Woodcourt.My guardian and Ada and I heard of Miss Flite having been ill and whenwe called we found a medical gentleman attending her in her garret inLincoln's Inn.Miss Flite dropped a general curtsy."Honoured indeed" she said "by another visit from the wards inJarndyce Very happy to receive Jarndyce of Bleak House beneath myhumble roof""Has she been very ill" asked Mr. Jarndyce in a whisper of the doctor."Oh decidedly unwell" she answered confidentially. "Not pain youknow--trouble. Only Mr. Woodcourt knows how much. My physician Mr.Woodcourt"--with great stateliness--"The wards in Jarndyce Jarndyce ofBleak House. The kindest physician in the college" she whispered to me."I expect a judgment. On the Day of Judgment. And shall then conferestates.""She will be as well in a day or two" said Mr. Woodcourt with anobservant smile "as she ever will be. Have you heard of her goodfortune""Most extraordinary" said Miss Flite. "Every Saturday Kenge and Carboyplace a paper of shillings in my hand. Always the same number. One forevery day in the week. _I_ think that the Lord Chancellor forwards them.Until the judgment I expect is given."My guardian was contemplating Miss Flite's birds and I had no need tolook beyond him._III.--I Am Made Happy_I sometimes thought that Mr. Woodcourt loved me and that if he hadbeen richer he would perhaps have told me that he loved me before hewent away. I had thought sometimes that if he had done so I should havebeen glad. As it was he went to the East Indies and later we read inthe papers of a great shipwreck that Allan Woodcourt had worked like ahero to save the drowning and succour the survivors.I had been ill when my dear guardian asked me one day if I would care toread something he had written and I said "Yes." There was estrangementat that time between Richard and Mr. Jarndyce for the unhappy boy hadtaken it into his head that the case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce would yetbe settled and would bring him fortune and this kept him from devotinghimself seriously to any profession. Of course he and my darling Adahad fallen in love and my guardian insisting on their waiting tillRichard was earning some income before any engagement could berecognised increased the estrangement. I knew to my distress thatRichard suspected my guardian of having a conflicting claim in thehorrible lawsuit and this made him think unjustly of Mr. Jarndyce.
comment436,I read the letter. It was so impressive in its love for me and in theunselfish caution it gave me that my eyes were too often blinded toread much at a time. But I read it through three times before I laid itdown. It asked me would I be the mistress of Bleak House. It was not alove-letter though it expressed so much love but was written just ashe would at any time have spoken to me.I felt that to devote my life to his happiness was to thank him poorlyfor all he had done for me. Still I cried very much not only in thefulness of my heart after reading the letter but as if something forwhich there was no name or distinct idea were lost to me. I was veryhappy very thankful very hopeful but I cried very much.On entering the breakfast-room next morning I found my guardian just asusual quite as frank as open as free. I thought he might speak to meabout the letter but he never did.At the end of a week I went to him and said rather hesitating andtrembling "Guardian when would you like to have the answer to theletter""When it's ready my dear" he replied."I think it's ready" said I "and I have brought it myself."I put my two arms around his neck and kissed him and he said was thisthe mistress of Bleak House And I said "Yes" and it made no differencepresently and I said nothing to my pet Ada about it.It was a few days after this when Mr. Vholes the attorney whom Richardemployed to watch his interests called at Bleak House and told us thathis client was very embarrassed financially and so thought of throwingup his commission in the army.To avert this I went down to Deal and found Richard alone in thebarracks. He was writing at a table with a great confusion of clothestin cases books boots and brushes strewn all about the floor. So wornand haggard he looked even in the fulness of his handsome youthMy mission was quite fruitless."No Dame Durden Two subjects I forbid. The first is John Jarndyce. Thesecond you know what. Call it madness and I tell you I can't help itnow and can't be sane. But it is no such thing it is the one object Ihave to pursue."He went on to tell me that it was impossible to remain a soldier thatapart from debts and duns he took no interest in his employment and wasnot fit for it. He showed me papers to prove that his retirement wasarranged. Knowing I had done no good by coming down I prepared toreturn to London on the morrow.There was some excitement in the town by reason of the arrival of a bigIndiaman and as it happened amongst those who came on shore from theship was Mr. Allan Woodcourt. I met him in the hotel where I wasstaying and he seemed quite pleased to see me. He was glad to meetRichard again too and promised on my asking him to befriend Richard
comment437,in London._IV.--End of Jarndyce and Jarndyce_Richard always declared that it was Ada he meant to see righted no lessthan himself and his anxiety on that point so impressed Mr. Woodcourtthat he told me about it. It revived a fear I had had before that mydear girl's little property might be absorbed by Mr. Vholes and thatRichard's justification to himself would be this.So I went up to London to see Richard who now lived in Symond's Innand my darling Ada went with me. He was poring over a table covered withdusty papers but he received us very affectionately.I noticed as he passed his two hands over his head how sunken and howlarge his eyes appeared and how dry his lips were. He spoke of the casehalf-hopefully half-despondently "Either the suit must be endedEsther or the suitor. But it shall be the suit--the suit." Then he tooka few turns up and down and sank upon the sofa. "I get so tired" hesaid gloomily. "It is such weary weary work.""Esther dear" Ada said very quietly "I am not going home again.Never any more. I am going to stay with my dear husband. We have beenmarried above two months. Go home without me my own Esther I shallnever go home any more."I often came to Richard and his wife and I often met Mr. Woodcourtthere. Richard still suspected my guardian and refused to see him andwhen I said this was so unreasonable my guardian only said "What shallwe find reasonable in Jarndyce and Jarndyce Unreason and injustice frombeginning to end if it ever has an end. How should poor Rick alwayshovering near it pluck reason out of it"It was some months after this when Mr. Woodcourt asked me to be hiswife and I had to tell him I was not free. But I had to tell him that Icould never forget how proud and glad I was at having been beloved byhim.He took my hand and kissed it and was like himself again.All this time my guardian had never referred to his letter or my answerso I said to him next morning I would be the mistress of Bleak Housewhenever he pleased."Next month" my guardian said gaily."Next month dear guardian."At the end of the month my guardian went away to Yorkshire and asked meto follow him. I was very much surprised and when the journey was overmy guardian explained that he had asked me to come down to see a househe had bought for Mr. Woodcourt with whom he was always very pleased.It was a beautiful summer morning when we went out to look at the houseand there over the porch was written. "Bleak House." He led me to aseat and sitting down beside me said"When I wrote you the letter to which you brought the answer"--myguardian smiled as he referred to it--"I had my own happiness too muchin view but I had yours too. Hear me my love but do not speak. When
comment438,Woodcourt came home I saw that there was other happiness for you I sawwith whom you would be happier. Well I have long been in AllanWoodcourt's confidence although he was not until yesterday in mine.One more last word. When Allan Woodcourt spoke to you my dear he spokewith my knowledge and consent. But I gave him no encouragement not Ifor these surprises were my great reward and I was too miserly to partwith a scrap of it. He was to come and tell me all that passed and hedid. I have no more to say. This is Bleak House. This day I give thishouse its little mistress and before God it is the brightest day in allmy life."He rose and raised me with him. We were no longer alone. My husband--Ihave called him by that name full seven happy years now--stood at myside."Allan" said my guardian "take from me the best wife that ever manhad. What more can I say for you than that I know you deserve her"He kissed me once again. And now the tears were in his eyes as he saidmore softly "Esther my dearest after so many years there is a kindof parting in this too. I know that my mistake has caused you somedistress. Forgive your old guardian in restoring him to his old place inyour affections. Allan take my dear."We all three went home together next day. We had an intimation from Mr.Kenge that the case would come on at Westminster in two days and that acertain will had been found which might end the suit in Richard'sfavour.Allan took me down to Westminster and when we came to Westminster Hallwe found that the Court of Chancery was full and that something unusualhad occurred. We asked a gentleman by us if he knew what case was on. Hetold us Jarndyce and Jarndyce and that as well as he could make outit was over. Over for the day "No" he said "over for good."In a few minutes a crowd came streaming out and we saw Mr. Kenge. Hetold us that Jarndyce and Jarndyce was a monument of Chancery practiceand--in a good many words--that the case was over because the wholeestate was found to have been absorbed in costs.We hurried away first to my guardian and then to Ada and Richard.Richard was lying on the sofa with his eyes closed when I went in. Whenhe opened them I fully saw for the first time how worn he was. But hespoke cheerfully and said how glad he was to think of our intendedmarriage.In the evening my guardian came in and laid his hand softly onRichard's."Oh sir" said Richard "you are a good man a good man" and burstinto tears.My guardian sat down beside him keeping his hand on Richard's."My dear Rick" he said "the clouds have cleared away and it is brightnow. We can see now. And how are you my dear boy""I am very weak sir but I hope I shall be stronger. I have to beginthe world."He sought to raise himself a little."Ada my darling" Allan raised him so that she could hold him on herbosom. "I have done you many wrongs my own. I have married you topoverty and trouble I have scattered your means to the winds. You willforgive me all this my Ada before I begin the world"A smile lit up his face as she bent to kiss him. He slowly laid his faceupon her bosom drew his arms closer round her neck and with oneparting sob began the world. Not this--oh not this The world that setsthis right.                                   David Copperfield      "David Copperfield"--published in 1849-50--will always be     acclaimed by many as the best of all Dickens's books. It was     its author's favourite and its universal and lasting     popularity is entirely deserved. "David Copperfield" is     especially remarkable for the autobiographical element not     only in the wretched days of childhood at the wine merchant's     but in the shorthand-reporting in the House of Commons.     Dickens never forgot his early degradation as it seemed to     him in the blacking warehouse at Hungerford Stairs or quite
comment439,     forgave those who sent him to an occupation he so loathed.     Much of "David Copperfield" is familiar in our mouths as     household words and Swinburne has maintained that Micawber     ranks with Dick Swiveller as one of the greatest characters in     all Dickens's novels. "Copperfield" comes midway in the great     list of works by Charles Dickens._I.--My Early Childhood_I was born as I have been informed and believe on a Friday at twelveo'clock at night at Blunderstone in Suffolk. I was a posthumous child.My father's eyes had been closed upon the light of this world six monthswhen mine opened upon it. Miss Betsey Trotwood an aunt of my father'sand consequently a great-aunt of mine arrived on the afternoon of theday I was born and explained to my mother who was very much afraid ofher that she meant to provide for her child which was to be a girl.My aunt said never a word when she learnt that it was a boy and not agirl but took her bonnet by the strings in the manner of a sling aimeda blow at the doctor's head with it put it on bent walked out andnever came back. She vanished like a discontented fairy.The first objects that assume a distinct presence before me as I lookfar back into the blank of my infancy are my mother with her prettyair and youthful shape and Peggotty my old nurse with no shape atall and with cheeks and arms so red and hard that I wondered the birdsdidn't peck her in preference to apples.I remember a few years later a gentleman with beautiful black hair andwhiskers walking home from church on Sunday with us and somehow Ididn't like him or his deep voice and I was jealous that his handshould touch my mother's in touching me--which it did.It must have been about this time that waking up from an uncomfortabledoze one night I found Peggotty and my mother both in tears and bothtalking."Not such a one as this Mr. Copperfield wouldn't have liked" saidPeggotty. "That I say and that I swear""Good heavens" cried my mother. "You'll drive me mad How can you havethe heart to say such bitter things to me when you are well aware thatout of this place I haven't a single friend to turn to" But thefollowing Sunday I saw the gentleman with the black whiskers again andhe walked home from church with us and gradually I became used toseeing him and knowing him as Mr. Murdstone. I liked him no better thanat first and had the same uneasy jealousy of him.It was on my return from a visit to Yarmouth where I went with Peggottyto spend a fortnight at her brother's that I found my mother married to
comment440,Mr. Murdstone. They were sitting by the fire in the best parlour when Icame in.I gave him my hand. After a moment of suspense I went and kissed mymother. I could not look at her I could not look at him I knew quitewell he was looking at us both. As soon as I could creep away I creptupstairs and cried myself to sleep.A word of encouragement of pity for my childish ignorance of welcomehome of reassurance to me that it _was_ home might have made medutiful to him in my heart henceforth instead of in my hypocriticaloutside and might have made me respect instead of hating him.Miss Murdstone arrived next day she was dark like her brother andgreatly resembled him in face and voice. Firmness was the grand qualityon which both of them took their stand.I soon fell into disgrace over my lessons. I never could do them with mymother satisfactorily with the Murdstones sitting by their influenceupon me was like the fascination of two snakes on a wretched young bird.One dreadful morning when the lessons had turned out even more badlythan usual Mr. Murdstone seized hold of me and twisted my head underhis arm preparatory to beating me with a cane. At the first stroke Icaught the hand with which he held me in my mouth between my teethand bit it through. He beat me then as if he would have beaten me todeath. And when he had gone I was kept a close prisoner in my room andwas not allowed to see my mother and was only permitted to walk in thegarden for half an hour every day. Miss Murdstone acted as gaoler andafter five days of this confinement she told me I was to be sent awayto school--to Salem House School Blackheath.I saw my mother before I left. They had persuaded her I was a wickedfellow and she was more sorry for that than for my going._II.--I Begin Life on My own Account_I was doing my second term at school when I was told that my mother wasdead and that I was to go home to the funeral.I never returned to Salem House. Mr. Murdstone and his sister left me tomyself and I could see that Mr. Murdstone liked me less than ever. Atodd times I speculated on the possibility of not being taught any moreor cared for any more and growing up to be a shabby moody manlounging an idle life away about the village.Peggotty was under notice to quit and thought of going to live with herbrother at Yarmouth but as it turned out she didn't do this butmarried the old carrier Barkis instead."Young or old Davy dear as long as I am alive and have this houseover my head" said Peggotty to me on the day she was married "youshall find it as if I expected you here directly. I shall keep it everyday as I used to keep your old little room my darling."The solitary condition I now fell into for some weeks was ended one dayby Mr. Murdstone telling me that I was to be put into the business ofMurdstone and Grinby."You will earn enough to provide for your eating and drinking andpocket money" said Mr. Murdstone. "Your lodging which I have arrangedfor will be paid by me. So will your washing and your clothes will belooked after for you too. You are now going to London David to beginthe world on your own account."
comment441,"In short you are provided for" observed his sister "and will pleaseto do your duty."So I became at ten years old a little labouring hind in the service ofMurdstone and Grinby.Murdstone and Grinby's warehouse was at the waterside down inBlackfriars and an important branch of their trade was the supply ofwines and spirits to certain packet ships. A great many empty bottleswere one of the consequences of this traffic and a certain number ofmen and boys of whom I was one were employed to rinse and wash them.When the empty bottles ran short there were labels to be pasted on fullones or corks to be fitted to them or finished bottles to be packed incasks.There were three or four boys counting me. Mick Walker was the name ofthe oldest he wore a ragged apron and a paper cap. The next boy wasintroduced to me under the extraordinary name of Mealy Potatoes whichhad been bestowed upon him on account of his complexion which was paleor mealy.No words can express the secret agony of my soul as I sunk into thiscompanionship and compared these associates with those of my happierchildhood with the boys at Salem House. Often in the early morningwhen I was alone I mingled my tears with the water in which I waswashing the bottles and sobbed as if there were a flaw in my breastand it were in danger of bursting.My salary was six or seven shillings a week--I think it was six atfirst and seven afterwards--and I had to support myself on that moneyall the week. My breakfast was a penny loaf and a pennyworth of milkand I kept another small loaf and a modicum of cheese to make my supperon at night.I was so young and childish and so little qualified to undertake thewhole charge of my existence that often of a morning I could not resistthe stale pastry put out for sale at half price at the pastry-cooks'doors and spent on that the money I should have kept for my dinner. Onthose days I either went without my dinner or bought a roll or a sliceof pudding.I was such a child and so little that frequently when I went into thebar of a strange public-house for a glass of ale or porter to moistenwhat I had for dinner they were afraid to give it me.I know I do not exaggerate the scantiness of my resources or thedifficulties of my life. I know that if a shilling were given me at anytime I spent it in a dinner or a tea. I know that I worked from morninguntil night a shabby child and that I lounged about the streetsinsufficiently and unsatisfactorily fed. I know that but for the mercyof God I might easily have been for any care that was taken of me alittle robber or a little vagabond.Arrangements had been made by Mr. Murdstone for my lodging with Mr.Micawber--who took orders on commission for Murdstone and Grinby--andMr. Micawber himself escorted me to his house in Windsor Terrace CityRoad.Mr. Micawber was a stoutish middle-aged person in a brown surtoutwith no more hair upon his head than there is upon an egg and with avery extensive face. His clothes were shabby but he wore an imposing
comment442,shirt-collar. He carried a jaunty sort of a stick with a large pair ofrusty tassels to it and an eyeglass hung outside his coat--forornament I afterwards found as he very seldom looked through it andcouldn't see anything when he did.Arrived at his house in Windsor Terrace--which I noticed was shabbylike himself but also like himself made all the show it could--hepresented me to Mrs. Micawber a thin and faded lady not at all young."I never thought" said Mrs. Micawber as she showed me my room at thetop of the house at the back "before I was married that I should everfind it necessary to take a lodger. But Mr. Micawber being indifficulties all considerations of private feeling must give way."I said "Yes ma'am.""Mr. Micawber's difficulties are almost overwhelming just at present"said Mrs. Micawber "and whether it is possible to bring him throughthem I don't know. If Mr. Micawber's creditors _will not_ give him timethey must take the consequences."In my forlorn state I soon became quite attached to this family andwhen Mr. Micawber's difficulties came to a crisis and he was arrestedand carried to the King's Bench Prison in the Borough and Mrs. Micawbershortly afterwards followed him I hired a little room in theneighbourhood of that institution.Mr. Micawber was in due time released under the Insolvent Debtors' Actand it was decided that he should go down to Plymouth where Mrs.Micawber held that her family had influence.My own mind was now made up. I had resolved to run away--to go by somemeans or other down into the country to the only relation I had in theworld and tell my story to my aunt Miss Betsey. I knew from Peggottythat Miss Betsey lived near Dover but whether at Dover itself atHythe Sandgate or Folkstone she could not say. One of our menhowever informing me on my asking him about these places that they wereall close together I deemed this enough for my object and after seeingthe Micawbers off at the coach office I set off._III.--My Aunt Provides for Me_It was on the sixth day of my flight that I reached the wide downs nearDover and set foot in the town.I had walked every step of the way sleeping under haystacks at night.Fortunately it was summer weather for I was obliged to part with coatand waistcoat to buy food. My shoes were in a woeful condition and myhat--which had served me for a nightcap too--was so crushed and bentthat no old battered saucepan on the dunghill need have been ashamed tovie with it. My shirt and trousers stained with heat dew grass andthe Kentish soil on which I had slept might have frightened the birdsfrom my aunt's garden as I stood at the gate. My hair had known no comb
comment443,or brush since I left London. In this plight I waited to introducemyself to my formidable aunt.As I stood there a lady came out of the house with a handkerchief overher cap a pair of gardening gloves on her hands and carrying a greatknife. I was sure she must be Miss Betsey from her walk for my motherhad often described the way my aunt came to the house when I was born."Go away" said Miss Betsey shaking her head. "Go along No boys here"I watched her as she marched to a corner of the garden and then indesperation I went softly and stood beside her."If you please ma'am--if you please aunt I am your nephew.""Oh Lord" said my aunt and sat flat down in the garden path."I am David Copperfield of Blunderstone in Suffolk where you camewhen I was born. I have been very unhappy since my mother died. I havebeen taught nothing and put to work not fit for me. It made me run awayto you and I have walked all the way and have never slept in bed sinceI began the journey."Here my self-support gave way all at once and I broke into a passion ofcrying.Thereupon my aunt got up in a great hurry collared me and took meinto the parlour.The first thing my aunt did was to pour the contents of several bottlesdown my throat. I think they must have been taken out at random for Iam sure I tasted aniseed water anchovy sauce and salad dressing. Thenshe put me on the sofa and acting on the advice of a pleasant-lookinggrey-headed gentleman whom she called "Mr. Dick" heated a bath for me.After that I was enrobed in a shirt and trousers belonging to Mr. Dicktied up in two or three great shawls and fell asleep.That was the beginning of my aunt's adoption of me. She wrote to Mr.Murdstone and he and his sister arrived a few days later and wererouted by my aunt.Mr. Murdstone said finally he would only take me back unconditionallyand that if I did not return there and then his doors would be shutagainst me henceforth."And what does the boy say" said my aunt. "Are you ready to go David"I answered "No" and entreated her not to let me go. I begged and prayedmy aunt to befriend and protect me for my father's sake."Mr. Dick" said my aunt "what shall I do with this child"Mr. Dick considered hesitated brightened and rejoined "Have himmeasured for a suit of clothes directly""Mr. Dick" said my aunt "give me your hand for your commonsense isinvaluable." She pulled me towards her and said to Mr. Murdstone "Youcan go when you like I'll take my chance with the boy"When they had gone my aunt announced that Mr. Dick would be joint
comment444,guardian of me with herself and that I should be called TrotwoodCopperfield.Thus I began my new life in a new name and with everything new aboutme.My aunt sent me to school at Canterbury and there being no room at theschool for boarders settled that I should board with her old lawyerMr. Wickfield.My aunt was as happy as I was in this arrangement. For Mr. Wickfield'shouse was quiet and still and Mr. Wickfield's little housekeeper washis only daughter Agnes a child of about my own age whose face sobright and happy was the child likeness of a woman's portrait that wason the staircase. There was a tranquility about the house and aboutAgnes a good calm spirit that I have never forgotten and never shall.The school I now went to was better in every way than Salem House. Itseemed to me so long however since I had been among any companions ofmy own age except Mick Walker and Mealy Potatoes that I felt verystrange at first. Whatever I had learnt had so slipped away from me thatwhen I was examined about what I knew I knew nothing and was put inthe lowest form of the school.But I got a little the better of my uneasiness when I went to school thenext day and a good deal the better the day after and so shook it offby degrees that in less than a fortnight I was quite at home and happyamong my new companions."Trot" said my aunt when she left me at Mr. Wickfield's "be a creditto yourself to me and Mr. Dick and Heaven be with you Never be meanin anything never be false never be cruel. Avoid these vices Trotand I can always be hopeful of you. And now the pony's at the door andI am off"She embraced me hastily and went out of the house shutting the doorafter her. When I looked into the street I noticed how dejectedly shegot into the chaise and that she drove away without looking up._IV.--Uriah Heep and Mr. Micawber_I first saw Uriah Heep on the day my aunt introduced me to Mr.Wickfield's house. He was then a red-haired youth of fifteen butlooking much older whose hair was cropped as close as the closeststubble who had hardly any eyebrows and no eyelashes and eyes of ared-brown. He was high-shouldered and bony dressed in decent blackwith a white wisp of a neck-cloth buttoned up to the throat and had along lank skeleton hand.Heep was Mr. Wickfield's clerk and I often saw him of an evening in thelittle round office reading and from time to time strayed in to talk tohim.He told me one night he was not doing office work but was improvinghis legal knowledge."I suppose you are quite a great lawyer" I said after looking at himfor some time."Me Master Copperfield" said Uriah. "Oh no I'm a very 'umble person.I am well aware that I am the 'umblest person going let the other bewhere he may. My mother is likewise a very 'umble person. We live in a
comment445,'umble abode Master Copperfield but have much to be thankful for. Myfather's former calling was 'umble he was a sexton.""What is he now" I asked."He is a partaker of glory at present Master Copperfield" said UriahHeep. "But we have much to be thankful for. How much have I to bethankful for in living with Mr. Wickfield"I asked Uriah if he had been with Mr. Wickfield long."I have been with him going on four years Master Copperfield" saidUriah "since a year after my father's death. How much I have to bethankful for in that How much have I to be thankful for in Mr.Wickfield's kind intention to give me my articles which would otherwisenot lay within the 'umble means of mother and self""Perhaps when you're a regular lawyer you'll be a partner in Mr.Wickfield's business one of these days" I said to make myselfagreeable "and it will be Wickfield and Heep or Heep late Wickfield.""Oh no Master Copperfield" returned Uriah shaking his head "I ammuch too 'umble for that"It must have been five or six years later when I was in London thatUriah recalled my prophecy to me.Agnes had noticed as I had noticed long before this a gradualalteration in Mr. Wickfield. He sat longer and longer over his wine andit was at such times when his hands trembled and his speech was notplain that Uriah was most certain to want him on some business.So it came about that Agnes had to tell me that Uriah had made himselfindispensable to her father."He is subtle and watchful" she said. "He has mastered papa'sweaknesses fostered them and taken advantage of them until papa isafraid of him."If I was indignant to hear that Uriah had wormed himself into suchpromotion I restrained my feelings when we met for Agnes had bidden menot to repel him for her father's sake and for her own."What a prophet you have shown yourself Master Copperfield" saidUriah reminding me of my early words. "You may not recollect it butwhen a person is 'umble a person treasures such things up. But the'umblest persons Master Copperfield may be instruments of good. I amglad to think I have been the instrument of good to Mr. Wickfield andthat I may be more so. Oh what a worthy man he is but how imprudent hehas been"When the rascal went on to tell me confidentially that he "loved theground his Agnes walked on" and that he thought she might come to bekind to him knowing his usefulness to her father I had a deliriousidea of seizing the red-hot poker out of the fire and running himthrough with it. However I thought of Agnes and could say nothing. Inthe end all the evil machinations of Uriah Heep were frustrated by myold friend Mr. Micawber who visiting Canterbury on the chance ofsomething suitable turning up and meeting me in Heep's company wassubsequently engaged by Heep as a clerk at twenty-two and sixpence perweek.It was only after Micawber had found that Uriah Heep had forged Mr.Wickfield's name to various documents and had fraudulently speculatedwith moneys entrusted by my aunt amongst others to his partner thathe turned upon him and denounced him and accomplished what he called"the final pulverisation of Keep."Mr. Micawber being once more "in pecuniary shackles" my aunt sograteful as we all were for the services he had rendered suggestedemigration to Australia to him he at once responded to the idea."The climate I believe is healthy" said Mrs. Micawber. "Then thequestion arises Now _are_ the circumstances of the country such that aman of Mr. Micawber's abilities would have a fair chance of rising--Iwill not say at present to be governor or anything of that sort butwould there be a reasonable opening for his talents to developthemselves If so it is evident to me that Australia is the legitimatesphere of action for Mr. Micawber.""I entertain the conviction" said Mr. Micawber "that it is underexisting circumstances the land the only land for myself and familyand that something of an extraordinary nature will turn up on that
comment446,shore."But the defeat of Heep and Micawber's departure belong to the days of mymanhood. Let me look back at intervening years._V.--I Achieve Manhood_My school-days The silent gliding on of my existence--the unseenunfelt progress of my life--from childhood up to youthTime has stolen on unobserved and _I_ am the head boy now in theschool and look down on the line of boys below me with a condescendinginterest in such of them as bring to my mind the boy I was myself when Ifirst came here. That little fellow seems to be no part of me Iremember him as something left behind upon the road of life and almostthink of him as of someone else.And the little girl I saw on that first day at Mr. Wickfield's where isshe Gone also. In her stead the perfect likeness of the picture achild likeness no more moves about the house and Agnes--my sweetsister as I call her in my thoughts my counsellor and friend--thebetter angel of the lives of all who come within her calm goodself-denying influence--is quite a woman.It is time for me to have a profession and my aunt proposes that Ishould be a proctor in Doctors' Commons. I learn that the proctors are asort of solicitors and that the Doctors' Commons is a faded court heldnear St. Paul's Churchyard where people's marriages and wills aredisposed of and disputes about ships and boats are settled.So I am articled and later when my aunt has lost her money through nofault of her own but through the rascality of Uriah Heep and I seekMr. Spenlow to know if it is possible for my articles to be cancelledit is I am assured Mr. Jorkins who is inexorable."If it had been my lot to have my hands unfettered if I had not apartner--Mr. Jorkins" says Mr. Spenlow. "But I know my partnerCopperfield. Mr. Jorkins is _not_ a man to respond to a proposition ofthis peculiar nature. Mr. Jorkins is very difficult to move from thebeaten track."The years pass.I have come legally to man's estate. I have attained the dignity oftwenty-one. Let me think what I have achieved.Determined to do something to bring in money I have mastered the savagemystery of shorthand and make a respectable income by reporting thedebates in Parliament for a morning newspaper. Night after night Irecord predictions that never come to pass professions that are neverfulfilled explanations that are only meant to mystify.I have come out in another way. I have taken with fear and tremblingto authorship. I wrote a little something in secret and sent it to amagazine and it was published. Since then I have taken heart to write agood many trifling pieces.My record is nearly finished.Peggotty a widow is with my aunt and Mr. Dick is in the room."Goodness me" said my aunt "who's this you're bringing home""Agnes" said I.We were to be married within a fortnight. It was not till I had toldAgnes of my love that I learnt from her as she laid her gentle handsupon my shoulders and looked calmly in my face that she had loved meall my life.Let me look back once more for the last time before I close theseleaves.I have advanced in fame and fortune. I have been married ten years andI see my children playing in the room.Here is my aunt in stronger spectacles an old woman of fourscore yearsand more but upright yet and godmother to a real living BetseyTrotwood. Always with her here comes Peggotty my good old nurselikewise in spectacles. A newspaper from Australia tells me that Mr.Micawber is now a magistrate and a rising townsman at Port Middlebay.One face is above all these and beyond them all. I turn my head and seeit in its beautiful serenity beside me. So may thy face be by meAgnes when I close my life and when realities are melting from me mayI still find thee near me pointing upward                                   
comment447,Dombey and Son      The publication of "Dombey and Son" began in October 1846     and the story was completed in twenty monthly parts at one     shilling each the last number being issued in April 1848.     Its success was striking and immediate the sale of its first     number exceeding that of "Martin Chuzzlewit" by more than     12000 copies--a remarkable thing considering the immense     superiority of "Chuzzlewit." "Dombey and Son" indeed is by     no means one of Dickens's best books though little Paul will     always retain the sympathies of the reader and the story of     his short life for ever move us with its pathos. The     popularity of "Dombey and Son" provoked an impudent     publication called "Dombey and Daughter" which was started in     January 1847 and was issued monthly at a penny. Two stage     versions of "Dombey" appeared--in London in 1873 and in New     York in 1888 but in neither case was the adaptation     particularly successful. "What are the wild waves saying" was     made the subject of a song--a duet--which at one time was     widely sung but is now happily forgotten._I.--Dombey and Son_Dombey sat in the corner of the darkened room in the great armchair bythe bedside and Son lay tucked up warm in a little basket-bedstead.Dombey was about eight-and-forty years of age Son about eight-and-fortyminutes. Dombey was rather bald rather red and though a handsomewell-made man too stern and pompous in appearance to be prepossessing.Son was very bald and very red and somewhat crushed and spotted in hisgeneral effect as yet."The house will once again Mrs. Dombey" said Mr. Dombey "be not onlyin name but in fact Dombey and Son Dombey and Son He will bechristened Paul Mrs. Dombey of course"The sick lady feebly echoed "Of course" and closed her eyes again."His father's name Mrs. Dombey and his grandfather's I wish hisgrandfather were alive this day." And again he said "Dombey and Son" inexactly the same tone as before and then went downstairs to learn whatthat fashionable physician Dr. Parker Peps had to say for Mrs. Dombeylay very weak and still."Dombey and Son"--those three words conveyed the idea of Mr. Dombey'slife. The earth was made for Dombey and Son to trade in and the sun andmoon were made to give them light.He had risen as his father had before him in the course of life anddeath from Son to Dombey and for nearly twenty years had been the solerepresentative of the firm. Of those years he had been marriedten--married as some said to a lady with no heart to give him. Butsuch idle talk never reached the ears of Mr. Dombey. Dombey and Sonoften dealt in hides never in hearts. Mr. Dombey would have reasonedthat a matrimonial alliance with himself _must_ in the nature ofthings be gratifying and honourable to any woman of commonsense.One drawback only could be admitted. Until the present day there hadbeen no issue--to speak of. There had been a girl some six years beforea child who now crouched by her mother's bed unobserved. But what wasthat girl to Dombey and Son"Nature must be called upon to make a vigorous effort in this instance"said Doctor Parker Peps referring to Mrs. Dombey.Mrs. Chick Mr. Dombey's married sister emphasised this opinion."Now my dear Paul" said Mrs. Chick "you may rest assured that there isnothing wanting but an effort on Fanny's part."They returned to the sick-room and its stillness. In vain Mrs. Chickexhorted her sister-in-law to make an effort no sound came in answerbut the loud ticking of Mr. Dombey's watch and Dr. Parker Pep's watchwhich seemed in the silence to be running a race."Fanny" said Mrs. Chick "Only look at me. Only open your eyes to showme that you hear and understand me."Still no answer. Mrs. Dombey lay motionless clasping her littledaughter to her breast."Mamma" cried the child sobbing aloud. "Oh dear mamma"Thus clinging fast to that slight spar within her arms the motherdrifted out upon the dark and unknown sea that rolls round all theworld.Mr. Dombey in the days to come could not forget that closing scene--that he had had no part in it that he had stood a mere spectator while
comment448,those two figures lay clasped in each other's arms. His previousfeelings of indifference towards his little daughter Florence changedinto an uneasiness of an extraordinary kind. He had never conceived anaversion to her it had not been worth his while or in his humour. Butnow he was ill at ease about her. He read nothing in her glance when hesaw her later in the solemn house of the passionate desire to runclinging to him and the dread of a repulse the pitiable need in whichshe stood of some assurance and encouragement. He saw nothing of this._II.--Mrs. Pipchin's_In spite of his early promise all the vigilance and care bestowed uponhim could not make little Paul a thriving boy. There was something wanand wistful in his look and he had a strange old-fashioned thoughtfulway of sitting brooding in his miniature armchair.The medical practitioner recommended sea-air and Mrs. Pipchin whoconducted an infantile boarding house of a very select description atBrighton and whose scale of charges was high was entrusted with thecare of Paul's health when he was little more than five years old.Mrs. Pipchin was a marvellous ill-favoured ill-conditioned old ladywith a mottled face like bad marble a hook nose and a hard grey eye.It was generally said that Mrs. Pipchin was a woman of system withchildren and no doubt she was. Certainly the wild ones went home tameenough after sojourning for a few months beneath her hospitable roof.At this exemplary old lady Paul would sit staring in his little armchairby the fire for any length of time. He was not fond of her he was notafraid of her.Once she asked him when they were alone what he was thinking about."You" said Paul without the least reserve. "I'm thinking how old youmust be.""You mustn't say such things as that young gentleman" returned thedame."Why not" asked Paul."Because it's not polite" said Mrs. Pipchin snappishly."Not polite" said Paul."No And remember the story of the little boy that was gored to death bya mad bull for asking questions""If the bull was mad" said Paul "how did _he_ know that the boy hadasked questions Nobody can go and whisper secrets to a mad bull. Idon't believe that story.""You don't believe it sir""No" said Paul."Not if it should happen to have been a tame bull you little infidel"said Mrs. Pipchin.As Paul had not considered the subject in that light he allowed himselfto be put down for the present.Mr. Dombey came down to Brighton every Sunday and Florence was herbrother's constant companion.At first Paul got no stronger and a little carriage was procured forhim in which he could lie at his ease and be wheeled down to thesea-side there he would sit or lie for hours together never sodistressed as by the company of children--Florence alone exceptedalways."Go away if you please" he would say to any child who came up to him."Thank you but I don't want you. I think you had better go and play ifyou please."His favourite spot was quite a lonely one far away from most loungersand with Florence sitting by his side and the wind blowing on hisface and the water near the wheels of his bed he wanted nothing more."I want to know what it says" he said once looking steadily in herface. "The sea Floy what is it that it keeps on saying"She told him that it was only the noise of the rolling waves."Yes yes" he said. "But I know that they are always saying something.Always the same thing. What place is over there" He rose up lookingeagerly at the horizon.She told him that there was another country opposite but he said hedidn't mean that he meant farther away--farther awayVery often afterwards in the midst of their talk he would break off
comment449,to try to understand what it was that the waves were always saying andwould rise up on his couch to look at that invisible region far away.At the end of twelve months at Mrs. Pipchin's Paul had grown strongenough to dispense with his little carriage though he still looked thinand delicate.Mr. Dombey therefore decided to remove him not from Brighton but toDoctor Blimber's educational establishment. "I fear" said Mr. Dombeyaddressing Mrs. Pipchin "that my son in his studies is behind manychildren of his age. Now instead of being behind his peers my son oughtto be before them--far before them. There is an eminence ready for himto mount upon. The education of my son must not be delayed. It must notbe left imperfect."Doctor Blimber only undertook the charge of ten young gentlemen and hisestablishment was a great hot-house in which there was a forcingapparatus incessantly at work.Florence would remain at Mrs. Pipchin's and for the first six monthsPaul would return there for the Sunday."Now Paul" said Mr. Dombey exultingly when they stood on the doctor'sdoorsteps "This is the way indeed to be Dombey and Son and havemoney. You are almost a man already.""Almost" returned the child._III.--Doctor Blimber's Academy_The Doctor was a portly gentleman in a suit of black with strings athis knees and stockings below them. He had a bald head highlypolished a deep voice and a chin so very double that it was a wonderhow he ever managed to shave into the creases.Mrs. Blimber was not learned herself but she pretended to be and thatdid quite as well.As to Miss Blimber there was no light nonsense about her. She was dryand sandy with working in the graves of dead languages.Mr. Feeder B.A. Dr. Blimber's assistant was a kind of human barrel-organ with a list of tunes at which he was continually working overand over again without any variation.Under the forcing system at Dr. Blimber's a young gentleman usually tookleave of his spirits in three weeks he had all the cares of the worldon his head in three months and he conceived bitter sentiments againsthis parents or guardians in four.The doctor was sitting in his study when Mr. Dombey and Paul arrived."And how do you do sir" he said to Mr. Dombey. "And how is my littlefriend" It seemed to Paul as if the great clock in the hall took thisup and went on saying "how is my lit-tle friend how is my
comment450,lit-tle friend" over and over again.Paul was handed over to Miss Blimber at once to be "brought on.""Cornelia" said the doctor. "Dombey will be your charge at first. Bringhim on Cornelia bring him on."It was hard work for no sooner had Paul mastered subject A than he wasimmediately provided with subject B from which we passed to C and evenD. Often he felt giddy and confused and drowsy and dull.But there were always the Saturdays when Florence came at noon to fetchhim and never would she in any weather stay away. Florence broughtthe school-books he was studying and every Saturday night wouldpatiently assist him through so much as they could anticipate togetherof his next week's work. And this saved him possibly from sinkingunderneath the burden which the fair Cornelia Blimber piled upon hisback.It was not that Miss Blimber meant to be too hard upon him or that Dr.Blimber meant to bear too heavily on the young gentlemen in general. Butwhen Dr. Blimber said that Paul made great progress and was naturallyclever Mr. Dombey was more bent than ever on his being forced andcrammed.Such spirits as he had at the outset Paul soon lost of course. But heretained all that was strange and odd and thoughtful in his characterand Mrs. Blimber thought him "odd" and whispered that he was "oldfashioned" and that was all.Between little Paul Dombey the youngest and Mr. Toots the oldest ofDr. Blimber's young gentlemen a strong attachment existed. Toots had"gone through" so much that he had left off growing and was free topursue his own course of study which was chiefly to write long lettersto himself from persons of distinction addressed "P. Toots EsquireBrighton" to preserve them in his desk with great care."How are you" Toots would say to Paul fifty times a day."Quite well sir thank you" Paul would answer."Shake hands" would be Toot's next advance. Which Paul of coursewould immediately do."I say" cried Toots one evening finding Paul looking out of thewindow. "I say what do you think about""Oh I think about a great many things" replied Paul."Do you though" said Toots appearing to consider that fact in itselfsurprising."If you had to die" said Paul "don't you think you would rather die ona moonlight night when the sky is quite clear and the wind blowing asit did last night"Mr. Toots looking doubtfully at Paul said he didn't know about that."It was a beautiful night" said Paul. "There was a boat over there inthe full light of the moon a boat with a sail."Mr. Toots feeling called upon to say something suggested "Smugglers"and then added "or Preventive.""A boat with a sail" repeated Paul. "It went away into the distanceand what do you think it seemed to do as it moved with the waves"
comment451,"Pitch" said Mr. Toots."It seemed to beckon" said the child "to beckon me to come."Certainly people found him an "old-fashioned" child. At the end of theterm Dr. and Mrs. Blimber gave an early party to their pupils and theirparents and guardians and it was a day or two before this event whenPaul was taken ill. This illness released him from his books and madehim think the more of Florence.They all loved "Dombey's sister" at that party and Paul sitting in acushioned corner heard her praises constantly. There was ahalf-intelligible sentiment too diffused around referring to Florenceand himself and breathing sympathy for both that soothed and touchedhim. He did not know why but it seemed to have something to do with his"old-fashioned" reputation.The time arrived for taking leave."Good-bye Doctor Blimber" said Paul stretching out his hand."Good-bye my little friend" returned the doctor. "Dombey Dombey youhave always been my favourite pupil.""God bless you" said Cornelia taking both Paul's hands in hers. And itshowed Paul thought how easily one might do injustice to a person forMiss Blimber meant it--though she _was_ a Forcer--and felt it.There was a general move after Paul and Florence down the staircase inwhich the whole Blimber family were included. Such a circumstance Mr.Feeder said aloud as has never happened in the case of any former younggentleman within his experience. The servants with the butler--a sternman--at their head had all an interest in seeing little Dombey gowhile the young gentlemen pressed to shake hands with him cryingindividually "Dombey don't forget me"Once for a last look Paul turned and gazed upon the faces addressed tohim and from that time whenever he thought of Dr. Blimber's it cameback as he had seen it in this last view and it never seemed to be areal place but always a dream full of faces._IV.--Paul Goes Out with the Stream_From the night they brought him home from Dr. Blimber's Paul had neverrisen from his little bed. He lay there listening to the noises in thestreet quite tranquilly not caring much how the time went butwatching it and watching everywhere about him with observing eyes.When the sunbeams struck into his room through the rustling blinds andquivered on the opposite wall like golden water he knew that eveningwas coming on.By little and little he got tired of the bustle of the day the noise ofthe carriages and carts and people passing and repassing and wouldfall asleep or be troubled with a restless and uneasy sense of a rushingriver. "Why will it never stop Floy" he would sometimes ask her. "Itis bearing me away I think"But Floy could always soothe him.He was visited by as many as three grave doctors and the room was soquiet and Paul was so observant of them that he even knew thedifference in the sound of their watches. But his interest centred inSir Parker Peps for Paul had heard them say long ago that that
comment452,gentleman had been with his mamma when she clasped Florence in her armsand died. And he could not forget it now. He liked him for it. He wasnot afraid.The people in the room were always changing and in the night-time Paulbegan to wonder languidly who the figure was with its head upon itshand that returned so often and remained so long."Floy" he said "what is that--there at the bottom of the bed""There's nothing there except papa."The figure lifted up its head and rose and said "My own boy Don't youknow me"Paul looked it in the face and thought was that his father The nexttime he observed the figure at the bottom of the bed he called to it."Don't be sorry for me dear papa. Indeed I am quite happy."That was the beginning of his always saying in the morning that he was agreat deal better and that they were to tell his father so.How many times the golden water danced upon the wall how many nightsthe dark dark river rolled towards the sea Paul never counted neversought to know.One night he had been thinking of his mother and her picture in thedrawing-room downstairs."Floy did I ever see mamma""No darling."The river was running very fast now and confusing his mind. Paul fellasleep and when he awoke the sun was high."Floy come close to me and let me see you."Sister and brother wound their arms around each other and the goldenlight came streaming in and fell upon them locked together."How fast the river runs between its green banks and the rushes FloyBut it's very near the sea. I hear the waves. They always said so."Presently he told her that the motion of the boat upon the stream waslulling him to rest now the boat was out at sea but gliding smoothlyon. And now there was a shore before him. Who stood on the bankHe put his hands together as he had been used to do at his prayers. Hedid not remove his arms to do it but they saw him fold them so behindher neck."Mamma is like you Floy. I know her by the face The light about herhead is shining on me as I go."The golden ripple on the wall came back again and nothing else stirredin the room. The old old fashion The fashion that came in with ourfirst parents and will last unchanged until our race has run itscourse and the wide firmament is rolled up like a scroll. The old oldfashion--Death_V.--The End of Dombey and Son_The stonemason to whom Mr. Dombey gave his order for a tablet in thechurch in memory of little Paul called his attention to theinscription "Beloved and only child" and said "It should be 'son' Ithink sir""You are right of course. Make the correction."And there came a time when it was to Florence and Florence only thatMr. Dombey turned. For the great house of Dombey and Son fell and inthe crash its proud head became a ruined man ruined beyond recovery.Bankrupt in purse his personal pride was yet further humbled. For Mr.
comment453,Dombey had married again a loveless match and his wife deserted him.In the hour when he discovered that desertion he had driven his daughterFlorence from the house.He was fallen now never to be raised up any more. For the night of hisworldly ruin there was no to-morrow's sun for the stain of his domesticshame there was no purification.In his pride--for he was proud yet--he let the world go from him freely.As it fell away he shook it off. He knew now what it was to berejected and deserted. Dombey and Son was no more--his children no more.His daughter Florence had married--married a young sailor once a boy inthe office of Dombey and Son--and thinking of her Dombey in thesolitude of his dismantled home remembered that she had never changedto him through all those years and the mist through which he had seenher cleared and showed him her true self.He wandered through the rooms and thought of suicide a guilty hand wasgrasping what was in his breast.It was arrested by a cry--a wild loud loving rapturous cry and hesaw his daughter."Papa Dearest papa"Unchanged still. Of all the world unchanged.He tottered to his chair. He felt her draw his arms about her neck. Hefelt her kisses on his face he felt--oh how deeply--all that he haddone.She laid his face now covered with his hands against the heart that hehad almost broken and said sobbing "Papa love I am a mother. Papadear oh say God bless me and my little child"His head now grey was encircled by her arm and he groaned to thinkthat never never had it rested so before."My little child was born at sea papa. I prayed to God to spare me thatI might come. The moment I could land I came to you. Never let us beparted any more papa"He kissed her on the lips and lifting up his eyes said "Oh my Godforgive me for I need it very much"                                   Great Expectations      "Great Expectations" first published as a serial in "All the     Year Round" in 1861 is one of Dickens's finest works. It is     rounded off so completely and the characters are so admirably     drawn that as a finished work of art it is hard to say where     the genius of its author has surpassed it. If there is less of     the exuberance of "Pickwick" there is also less of the     characteristic exaggeration of Dickens and the pathos of the     ex-convict's return is far deeper than the pathos of     children's death-beds so frequently exhibited by the author.     "Great Expectations" for all its rare qualities has never     achieved the wide popularity of the novels of Charles Dickens     that preceded it. We are not generally familiar with any name     in the story as we are with at least one name in all the     other novels. Yet Pip as a study of child-life youth and     early manhood is as excellent as anything in the whole range     of English fiction._I.--In the Marshes_My father's family name being Pirrip and my Christian name Philip Icalled myself with my infant tongue Pip and came to be called Pip.My first most vivid impression of things seems to me to have been gainedon a memorable raw afternoon one Christmas Eve. Ours was the marshcountry down the river within twenty miles of the sea and I hadwandered into a bleak place overgrown with nettles called a churchyard."Hold your noise" cried a terrible voice as a man started up fromamong the graves at the side of the church porch. "Keep still youlittle devil or I'll cut your throat"A fearful man all in coarse grey with a great iron on his leg. A manwho had been soaked in water and smothered in mud and cut by stoneswho limped and shivered and glared and growled."Oh don't cut my throat sir" I pleaded in terror. "Pray don't do itsir.""Tell us your name quick""Pip sir.""Show us where you live" said the man. "P'int out the place. Who d'yelive with"I pointed to where our village was and said "With my sister sir--Mrs.Joe Gargery--wife of Joe Gargery the blacksmith sir.""Blacksmith eh" said he and looked down at his leg. Then he took me
comment454,by the arms. "Now lookee here. You know what a file is""Yes sir.""And you know what wittles is""Yes sir.""You get me a file and you get me wittles. You bring 'em both to me orI'll have your heart and liver out. You bring the lot to me to-morrowmorning early that file and them wittles you bring the lot to me atthat old battery over yonder. You do it and you never dare to say aword concerning your having seen me and you shall be let to live. Youfail or you go from my words in any partickler no matter how small itis and your heart and your liver shall be tore out roasted and ate.Now what do you say"I said that I would get him the file and I would get him what brokenbits of food I could and I would come to him at the Battery early inthe morning.As soon as the darkness outside my little window was shot with grey Igot up and went downstairs. I stole some bread some rind of cheeseabout half a jar of mincemeat which I tied up in my pockethandkerchief some brandy from a stone bottle which I decanted into aglass bottle I had used for Spanish liquorice water up in my room ameat bone with very little on it and a beautiful round pork pie.There was a door in the kitchen communicating with the forge I unlockedand unbolted that door got a file from among Joe's tools put thefastenings as I had found them and ran for the marshes.It was a rainy morning and very damp. I knew my way to the Battery forI had been down there on a Sunday with Joe and had just scrambled upthe mound beyond the ditch when I saw the man sitting before me--withhis back toward me.I touched him on the shoulder and he instantly jumped up and it wasnot the same man but another man--dressed in coarse grey too with agreat iron on his leg.He aimed a blow at me and then ran into the mist stumbling as he wentand I lost him.I was soon at the Battery after that and there was the right manwaiting for me. He was awfully cold. And his eyes looked awfully hungry.He devoured the food mincemeat meatbone bread cheese and pork pieall at once--more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in aviolent hurry than a man who was eating it only stopping from time totime to listen."You're not a deceiving imp You brought no one with you""No sir No""Well" said he "I believe you. You'd be but a fierce young houndindeed if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretchedvarmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched varmintis."While he was eating I mentioned that I had just seen another man dressedlike him and with a badly bruised face."Not here" he exclaimed striking his left cheek."Yes there"He swore he would pull him down like a bloodhound and then crammed whatlittle food was left into the breast of his grey jacket and began tofile at his iron like a madman so I thought the best thing that I coulddo was to slip off home._II.--I Meet Estella_I must have been about ten years old when I went to Miss Havisham's andfirst met Estella.My uncle Pumblechook who kept a cornchandler's shop in the high-streetof the town took me to the large old dismal house which had all itswindows barred. For miles round everybody had heard of Miss Havisham asan immensely rich and grim lady who led a life of seclusion andeverybody soon knew that Mr. Pumblechook had been commissioned to bringher a boy.He left me at the courtyard and a young lady who was very pretty andseemed very proud let me in and I noticed that the passages were alldark and that there was a candle burning. My guide who called me"boy" but was really about my own age was as scornful of me as if shehad been one-and-twenty and a queen. She led me to Miss Havisham'sroom and there in an armchair with her elbow resting on the tablesat the strangest lady I have ever seen or shall ever see.She was dressed in rich materials--satins and lace and silks--all of
comment455,white--or rather which had been white but like all else in the roomwere now faded yellow. Her shoes were white and she had a long whiteveil dependent from her hair and bridal flowers in her hair but herhair was white. I saw that the bride within the bridal dress hadwithered like the dress."Who is it" said the lady at the table."Pip ma'am. Mr. Pumblechook's boy.""Come nearer let me look at you come close. You are not afraid of awoman who has never seen the sun since you were born""No ma'am.""Do you know what I touch here" she said laying her hands one uponthe other on her left side."Yes ma'am your heart.""Broken" She was silent for a little while and then added "I amtired I want diversion. Play play play"What was an unfortunate boy to do I didn't know how to play."Call Estella" said the lady. "Call Estella at the door."It was a dreadful thing to be bawling "Estella" to a scornful young ladyin a mysterious passage in an unknown house but I had to do it. AndEstella came and I heard her say in answer to Miss Havisham "Playwith this boy Why he is a common labouring boy"I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer "Well You can break hisheart."We played at beggar my neighbour and before the game was out Estellasaid disdainfully "He calls the knaves Jacks this boy And what coarsehands he has And what thick boots"I was very glad to get away. My coarse hands and my common boots hadnever troubled me before but they troubled me now and I determined toask Joe why he had taught me to call those picture cards Jacks whichought to be called knaves.For a long time I went once a week to this strange gloomy house--it wascalled Satis House--and once Estella told me I might kiss her.And then Miss Havisham decided I was to be apprenticed to Joe and gavehim 25 for the purpose and I left off going to see her and helped Joein the forge. But I didn't like Joe's trade and I was afflicted by thatmost miserable thing--to feel ashamed of home.I couldn't resist paying Miss Havisham a visit and not seeing Estellastammered that I hoped she was well."Abroad" said Miss Havisham "educating for a lady far out of reachprettier than ever admired by all who see her. Do you feel that youhave lost her"I was spared the trouble of answering by being dismissed and went homedissatisfied and uncomfortable thinking myself coarse and common andwanting to be a gentleman.It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship when one Saturday nightJoe and I were up at the Three Jolly Bargemen according to our custom.A stranger who did not recognise me but whom I recognised as agentleman I had met on the stairs at Miss Havisham's was in the roomand on his asking for a blacksmith named Gargery and his apprenticenamed Pip and being answered said he wanted to have a privateconference with us two.Joe took him home and the stranger told us his name was Jaggers andthat he was a lawyer in London."Now Joseph Gargery I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of thisyoung fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel hisindentures at his request and for his good""No" said Joe."The communication I have got to make to this young fellow is that hehas great expectations."Joe and I gasped and looked at one another."I am instructed to tell him" said Mr. Jaggers "that he will come intoa handsome property. Further it is the desire of the present possessorof that property that he be immediately removed from his present sphereof life and be brought up as a gentleman and that he always bear the
comment456,name of Pip. Now you are to understand that the name of the person whois your liberal benefactor remains a profound secret until the personchooses to reveal it and you are most positively prohibited from makingany inquiry on this head. If you have a suspicion keep it in your ownbreast."Mr. Jaggers went on to say that if I accepted the expectations on theseterms there was already money in hand for my education and maintenanceand that one Mr. Matthew Pocket in London whom I knew to be a relationof Miss Havisham's could be my tutor if I was willing to go to himsay in a week's time. Of course I accepted this wonderful good fortuneand had no doubt in my own mind that Miss Havisham was my benefactress.When Mr. Jaggers asked Joe whether he desired any compensation Joe laidhis hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman. "Pip is that heartywelcome" said Joe "to go free with his services to honour andfortun' as no words can tell him. But if you think as money can makecompensation to me for the loss of the little child--what come to theforge--and ever the best of friends" He scooped his eyes with hisdisengaged hand but said not another word._III.--I Know My Benefactor_I went to London and studied with Mr. Matthew Pocket and shared roomswith his son Herbert who knowing my earlier life decided to call meHandel first in Barnard's Inn and later in the Temple.On my twenty-first birthday I received 500 and this unknown toHerbert I managed to make over to my friend in order to secure him amanagership in a business house.My studies were not directed in any professional channel but werepursued with a view to my being equal to any emergency when myexpectations which I had been told to look forward to were fulfilled.Estella was often in London and I met her at many houses and wasdesperately in love with her. But though she treated me with friendshipshe was proud and capricious as ever and a few years later married aman whom I knew and detested--a Mr. Bentley Drummle a bully and ascoundrel.When I was three-and-twenty I happened to be alone one night in ourchambers reading for I had a taste for books. Herbert was away atMarseilles on a business journey.The clocks had struck eleven and I closed my books. I was stilllistening to the clocks when I heard a footstep on the staircase andstarted. The staircase lights were blown out by the wind and I took myreading-lamp and went out to see who it was."There is someone there is there not" I called out. "What floor do youwant""The top--Mr. Pip.""That is my name. There is nothing the matter""Nothing the matter" returned the voice. And the man came on.I made out that the man was roughly but substantially dressed that hehad iron-grey hair that his age was about sixty that he was a muscularman hardened by exposure to weather. I saw nothing that in the leastexplained him but I saw that he was holding out both his hands to me.I could not recall a single feature but I knew him. No need to take afile from his pocket and show it to me. I knew my convict in spite ofthe intervening years as distinctly as I knew him in the churchyardwhen we first stood face to face.He sat down on a chair that stood before the fire and covered hisforehead with his large brown hands."You acted nobly my boy" said he.I told him that I hoped he had mended his way of life and was doingwell."I've done wonderful well" he said. And then he asked me if I was doingwell. And when I mentioned that I had been chosen to succeed to someproperty he asked whose property And after that if mylawyer-guardian's name began with "J."
comment457,All the truth of my position came flashing on me and quickly Iunderstood that Miss Havisham's intentions towards me were all a meredream."Yes Pip dear boy I've made a gentleman on you. It's me wot has doneit I swore that time sure as ever I earned a guinea that guineashould go to you. I swore afterwards sure as ever I spec'lated and gotrich that you should get rich. Look 'ee here Pip. I'm your secondfather. You're my son--more to me nor any son. I've put away money onlyfor you to spend. You ain't looked slowly forward to this as I have. Youwasn't prepared for this as I wos. It warn't easy Pip for me to leavethem parts nor it wasn't safe. Look 'ee here dear boy caution isnecessary.""How do you mean" I said. "Caution""I was sent for life. It's death to come back. There's been overmuchcoming back of late years and I should of a certainty be hanged iftook."As Herbert was away I put the man in the spare room and gave out thathe was my uncle.He told me something of his story next day and when Herbert came backand we had found a bed-room for our visitor in Essex Street he told usall of it. His name was Magwitch--Abel Magwitch--he called himselfProvis now--and he had been left by a travelling tinker to grow upalone. "In jail and out of jail in jail and out of jail--that's my lifepretty much down to such times as I got shipped off arter Pip stood myfriend." But there was a man who "set up fur a gentleman namedCompeyson" and this Compeyson's business was swindling forging andstolen banknote passing. Magwitch became his servant and when both menwere arrested Compeyson turned round on the man whom he had employedand got off with seven years to Magwitch's fourteen. Compeyson was thesecond convict of my childhood.On consideration of the case and after consultation with Mr. Jaggerswho corroborated the statement that a colonist named Abel Magwitch ofNew South Wales was my benefactor and admitted that a Mr. Provis hadwritten to him on behalf of Magwitch concerning my address we decidedthat the best thing to be done was to take a lodging for Mr. Provis onthe riverside below the Pool at Mill Pond Bank. It was out of the wayand in case of danger it would be easy to get away by a packet steamer.The only danger was from Compeyson--for he had gone in terror of hislife and feared the vengeance of the man he had betrayed._IV--My Fortune_We were soon warned that Compeyson was aware of the return of his enemyand that flight was necessary. Both Herbert and I noticed how quicklyProvis had become softened and on the night when we were to take him onboard a Hamburg steamer he was very gentle.We were out in mid-stream in a small rowing boat moving quietly withthe tide when just as the Hamburg steamer came in sight a four-oaredgalley ran aboard of us and the man who held the lines in it calledout "You have a returned transport there. That's the man wrapped in thecloak. His name is Abel Magwitch--otherwise Provis. I call upon him tosurrender and you to assist."At once there was great confusion. The steamer was right upon us and Iheard the order given to stop the paddles. In the same moment I saw thesteersman of the galley lay his hand on the prisoner's shoulder and theprisoner start up lean across his captor and pull the cloak from the
comment458,neck of a shrinking man in the galley. Still in the same moment I sawthat the face disclosed was the face of the other convict of long agoand white terror was on it. Then I heard a cry and a loud splash in thewater and for an instant I seemed to struggle with a thousand millweirs the instant past I was taken on board the galley. Herbert wasthere but our boat was gone and the two convicts were gone. Presentlywe saw a man swimming but not swimming easily and knew him to beMagwitch. He was taken on board and instantly menacled at the wristsand ankles.It was not till we had pulled up and had landed at the riverside thatI could get some comforts for Magwitch who had received injury in thechest and a deep cut in the head. He told me that he believed himselfto have gone under the keel of the steamer and to have been struck onthe head in rising. The injury to his chest he thought he had receivedagainst the side of the galley. He added that Compeyson in the momentof his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him had staggered upand back and they had both gone overboard together locked in eachother's arms. He had disengaged himself under water and swam away.He was taken to the police-court next day and committed for trial atthe next session which would come on in a month."Dear boy" he said. "Look 'ee here. It's best as a gentleman shouldnot be knowed to belong to me now.""I will never stir from your side" said I "when I am suffered to benear you. Please God I will be as true to you as you have been to me"When the sessions came round the trial was very short and very clearand the capital sentence was pronounced. But the prisoner was very ill.Two of his ribs had been broken and one of his lungs seriously injuredand ten days before the date fixed for his execution death set him free."Dear boy" he said as I sat down by his bed on that last day. "Ithought you was late. But I knowed you couldn't be that. You've neverdeserted me dear boy."I pressed his hand in silence."And what's the best of all" he said "you've been more comfortablealong of me since I was under a dark cloud than when the sun shone.That's best of all."He had spoken his last words and holding my hand in his passed away.And with his death ended my expectations for the pocket-book containinghis wealth went to the Crown.Herbert took me into his business and I became a clerk and afterwardswent abroad to take charge of the eastern branch and when many a yearhad gone round became a partner.It was eleven years later when I was down in the marshes again. I hadbeen to see Joe Gargery who was as friendly as ever and had strolled
comment459,on to where Satis House once stood. I had been told of Miss Havisham'sdeath and also of the death of Estella's husband.Nothing was left of the old house but the garden wall and as I stoodlooking along the desolate garden walk a solitary figure came up. I sawit stop and half turn away and then let me come up to it. It falteredas if much surprised and uttered my name and I cried out "Estella"I took her hand in mine and we went out of the ruined place and as themorning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge so theevening mists were rising now and in all the broad expanse of tranquillight they showed to me I saw no shadow of another parting from her.                                    Hard Times      "Hard Times" is not one of the longest but it is one of the     most powerful of Dickens's works. John Ruskin went so far as     to call it "in several respects the greatest" book Dickens had     written. It is of course a fierce attack on the early     Victorian school of political economists. The Bounderbys and     Gradgrinds are typical of certain characters and though they     change their form of speech are still recognisable to-day. As     a study of social and industrial life in England in the     manufacturing districts fifty years ago "Hard Times" will     always be valuable though allowance must be made here as     elsewhere for the novelist's tendency to     exaggeration--exaggeration of virtue no less than of vice or     weakness. In Josiah Bounderby and Stephen Blackpool this     characteristic is pronounced. The first according to John     Ruskin being a dramatic monster and the second a dramatic     perfection. The story first appeared serially in "Household     Words" between April 1 and August 12 1854._I.--Mr. Thomas Gradgrind_"Thomas Gradgrind sir. A man of facts and calculations. With a rule anda pair of scales and the multiplication table always in his pocketsir ready to weigh and measure any parcel of human nature and tell youexactly what it comes to."In such terms Mr. Gradgrind always mentally introduced himself whetherto his private circle of acquaintance or to the public in general. Insuch terms Thomas Gradgrind presented himself to the schoolmaster andchildren before him. It was his school and he intended it to be amodel."Now what I want is facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing butfacts. Facts alone are wanted in life. You can only form the minds ofreasoning animals upon facts. This is the principle on which I bring upmy own children and this is the principle on which I bring up thesechildren. Stick to facts sir."
comment460,Mr. Gradgrind having waited to hear a model lesson delivered by theschool master walked home in a considerable state of satisfaction.There were five young Gradgrinds and they were models every one. Theyhad been lectured at from their tenderest years coursed like littlehares almost as soon as they could run they had been made to run tothe lecture-room.To his matter-of-fact home which was called Stone Lodge Mr. Gradgrinddirected his steps. The house was situated on a moor within a mile ortwo of a great town called Coketown.On the outskirts of this town a travelling circus "Sleary'sHorse-riding" had pitched its tent and to his amazement Mr.Gradgrind observed his two eldest children trying to obtain a peep atthe back of the booth of the hidden glories within.Mr. Gradgrind laid his hand upon the shoulder of each erring child andsaid "Louisa Thomas""I wanted to see what it was like" said Louisa shortly. "I brought himI was tired father. I have been tired a long time.""Tired Of what" asked the astonished father."I don't know of what--of everything I think."They walked on in silence for some half a mile before Mr. Gradgrindgravely broke out with "What would your best friends say Louisa Whatwould Mr. Bounderby say"All the way to Stone Lodge he repeated at intervals "What would Mr.Bounderby say"At the first mention of the name his daughter a child of fifteen orsixteen now but at no distant day to become a woman all at once stolea look at him remarkable for its intense and searching character. Hesaw nothing of it for before he looked at her she had again cast downher eyes.Mr. Bounderby was at Stone Lodge when they arrived. He stood before thefire on the hearth rug delivering some observations to Mrs. Gradgrindon the circumstance of its being his birthday. It was a commandingposition from which to subdue Mrs. Gradgrind.He stopped in his harangue which was entirely concerned with the storyof his early disadvantages at the entrance of his eminently practicalfriend and the two young culprits."Well" blustered Mr. Bounderby "what's the matter What is youngThomas in the dumps about"He spoke of young Thomas but he looked at Louisa."We were peeping at the circus" muttered Louisa haughtily "and fathercaught us.""And Mrs. Gradgrind" said her husband in a lofty manner "I should assoon have expected to find my children reading poetry.""Dear me" whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind. "How can you Louisa and Thomas Iwonder at you. I declare you're enough to make one regret ever having
comment461,had a family at all. I have a great mind to say I wish I hadn't. _Then_what would you have done I should like to know As if with my head inits present throbbing state you couldn't go and look at the shells andminerals and things provided for you instead of circuses. I'm sure youhave enough to do if that's what you want. With my head in its presentstate I couldn't remember the mere names of half the facts you have gotto attend to.""That's the reason" pouted Louisa."Don't tell me that's the reason because it can be nothing of thesort" said Mrs. Gradgrind. "Go and be something logical directly."Mrs. Gradgrind not being a scientific character usually dismissed herchildren to their studies with the general injunction that they were tochoose their own pursuit._II.--Mr. Bounderby of Coketown_Mr. Josiah Bounderby was as near being Mr. Gradgrind's bosom friend as aman perfectly devoid of sentiment can be to another man perfectly devoidof sentiment.He was a rich man--banker merchant manufacturer and what not. A bigloud man with a stare and a metallic laugh. A man who could neversufficiently vaunt himself--a self-made man. A man who was alwaysproclaiming through that brassy speaking-trumpet of a voice of his hisearly ignorance and poverty. A man who was the bully of humility.He was fond of telling was Mr. Bounderby how he was born in a ditchand abandoned by his mother how he ran away from his grandmother whostarved and ill-used him and so became a vagabond. "I pulled throughit" he would say "though nobody threw me out a rope. Vagabonderrand-boy labourer porter clerk chief manager smallpartner--Josiah Bounderby of Coketown."This myth of his early life was dissipated later and it turned out thathis mother a respectable old woman whom Bounderby pensioned off withthirty pounds a year on condition she never came near him had pinchedherself to help him out in life and put him as apprentice to a trade.From this apprenticeship he had steadily risen to riches.Mr. Bounderby held strong views about the people who worked for him the"hands" he called them and found whenever they complained of anythingthat they always expected to be set up in a coach and six and to be fedon turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon.As time went on and young Thomas Gradgrind became old enough to go intoBounderby's Bank Bounderby decided that Louisa was old enough to bemarried.Mr. Gradgrind now member of parliament for Coketown mentioned thematter to his daughter."Louisa my dear you are the subject of a proposal of marriage that hasbeen made to me."He waited as if he would have been glad that she said something.Strange to relate Mr. Gradgrind was not so collected at this moment ashis daughter was."I have undertaken to let you know that--in short that Mr. Bounderbyhas long hoped that the time might arrive when he should offer you hishand in marriage. That time has now come and Mr. Bounderby has made hisproposal to me and has entreated me to make it known to you.""Father" said Louisa "do you think I love Mr. Bounderby"Mr. Gradgrind was extremely discomforted by this unexpected question."Well my child" he returned "I--really--cannot take upon myself tosay.""Father" pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice as before "do youask me to love Mr. Bounderby""My dear Louisa no. No I ask nothing.""Father does Mr. Bounderby ask me to love him"
comment462,"Really my dear it is difficult to answer your question. Because thereply depends so materially Louisa on the sense in which we use theexpression. Mr. Bounderby does not pretend to anything sentimental. NowI should advise you to consider this question simply as one of fact.Now what are the facts of this case You are we will say in roundnumbers twenty years of age. Mr. Bounderby is we will say in roundnumbers fifty. There is some disparity in your respective years but inyour means and position there is none on the contrary there is a greatsuitability. Confining yourself rigidly to fact the questions of factare 'Does Mr. Bounderby ask me to marry him' 'Yes he does.' And'Shall I marry him'""Shall I marry him" repeated Louisa with great deliberation.There was silence between the two before Louisa spoke again. She thoughtof the shortness of life of how her brother Tom had said it would be agood thing for him if she made up her mind to do--she knew what."While it lasts" she said aloud "I would like to do the little I canand the little I am fit for. What does it matter Mr. Bounderby asks meto marry him. Let it be so. Since Mr. Bounderby likes to take me thus Iam satisfied to accept his proposal. Tell him father as soon as youplease that this was my answer. Repeat it word for word if you canbecause I should wish him to know what I said.""It is quite right my dear" retorted her father approvingly "to beexact I will observe your very proper request. Have you any wish inreference to the period of your marriage my child""None father. What does it matter"They went into the drawing-room and Mr. Gradgrind presented Louisa tohis wife as Mrs. Bounderby."Oh" said Mrs. Gradgrind. "So you have settled it. I am sure I give youjoy my dear and I hope you may turn all your ological studies to goodaccount. And now you see I shall be worrying myself morning noon andnight to know what I am to call him""Mrs. Gradgrind" said her husband solemnly "what do you mean""Whatever am I to call him when he is married to Louisa I must call himsomething. It's impossible to be constantly addressing him and nevergiving him a name. I cannot call him Josiah for the name isinsupportable to me. You yourself wouldn't hear of Joe you very wellknow. Am I to call my own son-in-law 'Mister' I believe not unless thetime has arrived when I am to be trampled upon by my relations. Thenwhat am I to call him"There being no answer to this conundrum Mrs. Gradgrind retired to bed.The day of the marriage came and after the wedding-breakfast thebridegroom addressed the company--an improving party there was nononsense about any of them--in the following terms."Ladies and gentlemen I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown. Since youhave done my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths andhappiness I suppose I must acknowledge the same. If you want a speechmy friend and father-in-law Tom Gradgrind is a member of parliamentand you know where to get it. Now you have mentioned that I am this daymarried to Tom Gradgrind's daughter. I am very glad to be so. It has
comment463,long been my wish to be so. I have watched her bringing up and Ibelieve she is worthy of me. At the same time I believe I am worthy ofher. So I thank you for the goodwill you have shown towards us."Shortly after which oration as they were going on a nuptial trip toLyons in order that Mr. Bounderby might see how the hands got on inthose parts and whether they too required to be fed with gold spoonsthe happy pair departed for the railroad. As the bride passed downstairsher brother Tom whispered to her. "What a game girl you are to be sucha first-rate sister too"She clung to him as she would have clung to some far better nature thatday and was shaken in her composure for the first time._III.--Mr. James Harthouse_The Gradgrind party wanting assistance in the House of Commons Mr.James Harthouse who was of good family and appearance and had triedmost things and found them a bore was sent down to Coketown to studythe neighbourhood with a view to entering Parliament.Mr. Bounderby at once pounced upon him and James Harthouse wasintroduced to Mrs. Bounderby and her brother. Tom Gradgrind juniorbrought up under a continuous system of restraint was a hypocrite athief and to Mr. James Harthouse a whelp.Yet the visitor saw at once that the whelp was the only creature Mrs.Bounderby cared for and it occurred to him as time went on that towin Mrs. Bounderby's affection for he made no secret of his contemptfor politics he must devote himself to the whelp.Mr. Bounderby was proud to have Mr. James Harthouse under his roofproud to show off his greatness and self-importance to this gentlemanfrom London."You're a gentleman and I don't pretend to be one. You're a man offamily. I am a bit of dirty riff-raff and a genuine scrap of rag tagand bobtail" said Mr. Bounderby.At the same time Mr. Bounderby blustered at his wife and bullied hishands so that Mr. Harthouse might understand his independence.One of these hands Stephen Blackpool an old steady faithful workmanwho had been boycotted by his fellows for refusing to join a tradeunion was summoned to Mr. Bounderby's presence in order that Harthousemight see a specimen of the people that had to be dealt with.Blackpool said he had nought to say about the trade union business hehad given a promise not to join that was all."Not to me you know" said Bounderby."Oh no sir not to you""Here's a gentleman from London present" Mr. Bounderby said pointingat Harthouse. "A Parliament gentleman. Now what do you complain of""I ha' not come here sir to complain. I were sent for. Indeed we are
comment464,in a muddle sir. Look round town--so rich as 'tis. Look how we liveand where we live an' in what numbers and look how the mills is alwaysa-goin' and how they never works us no nigher to any distant object'cepting always death. Sir I cannot wi' my little learning tell thegentleman what will better this though some working men o' this towncould. But the strong hand will never do't nor yet lettin' alone willnever do't. Ratin' us as so much power and reg'latin' us as if we wasfigures in a sum will never do't.""Now it's clear to me" said Mr. Bounderby "that you are one of thosechaps who have always got a grievance. And you are such a raspishill-conditioned chap that even your own union--the men who know youbest--will have nothing to do with you. And I tell you what I go so faralong with them for a novelty that I'll have nothing to do with youeither. You can finish off what you're at and then go elsewhere."Thus James Harthouse learnt how Mr. Bounderby dealt with hands.Mr. Harthouse however only felt bored and took the earliestopportunity to explain to Mrs. Bounderby that he really had no opinionsand that he was going in for her father's opinions because he might aswell back them as anything else."The side that can prove anything in a line of units tens hundredsand thousands Mrs. Bounderby seems to me to afford the most fun and togive a man the best chance. I am quite ready to go in for it to the sameextent as if I believed it. And what more could I possibly do if I didbelieve it"."You are a singular politician" said Louisa."Pardon me I have not even that merit. We are the largest party in thestate I assure you if we all fell out of our adopted ranks and werereviewed together."The more Mr. Harthouse's interest waned in politics the greater becamehis interest in Mrs. Bounderby. And he cultivated the whelp cultivatedhim earnestly and by so doing learnt from the graceless youth that "Loonever cared anything for old Bounderby" and had married him to pleaseher brother.Gradually bit by bit James Harthouse established a confidence with thewhelp's sister from which her husband was excluded. He established aconfidence with her that absolutely turned upon her indifference towardsher husband and the absence at all times of any congeniality betweenthem. He had artfully but plainly assured her that he knew her heartin its last most delicate recesses and the barrier behind which shelived had melted away.And yet he had not even now any earnest wickedness of purpose in him.So drifting icebergs setting with a current wreck the ships._IV.--Mr. Gradgrind and His Daughter_Mrs. Gradgrind died while her husband was up in London and Louisa waswith her mother when death came."You learnt a great deal Louisa and so did your brother" said Mrs.Gradgrind when she was dying. "Ologies of all kinds from morning tonight. But there is something--not an ology at all--that your father hasmissed or forgotten. I don't know what it is I shall never get itsname now. But your father may. It makes me restless. I want to write tohim to find out for God's sake what it is."It was shortly after Mrs. Gradgrind's death that Mr. Bounderby wascalled away from home on business for a few days and Mr. JamesHarthouse still not sure at times of his purpose found himself alonewith Mrs. Bounderby.They were in the garden and Harthouse implored her to accept him as herlover. She urged him to go away she commanded him to go away but sheneither turned her face to him nor raised it but sat as still as thoughshe were a statue.Harthouse declared that she was the stake for which he ardently desiredto play away all that he had in life that the objects he had latelypursued turned worthless beside her the success that was almost within
comment465,his grasp he flung away from him like the dirt it was compared withher.All this and more he said and pleaded for a further meeting."Not here" Louisa said calmly.They parted at the beginning of a heavy shower of rain and the fallJames Harthouse had ridden for was averted.Mrs. Bounderby left her husband's house left it for good not to shareMr. Harthouse's life but to return to her father.Mr. Gradgrind released from parliament for a time was alone in hisstudy when his eldest daughter entered."What is the matter Louisa""Father I want to speak to you. You have trained me from my cradle""Yes Louisa.""I curse the hour in which I was born to such a destiny. How could yougive me life and take from me all the things that raise it from thestate of conscious death Now hear what I have come to say. With ahunger and a thirst upon me father which have never been for a momentappeased in a condition where it seemed nothing could be worth the painand trouble of a contest you proposed my husband to me.""I never knew you were unhappy my child""I took him. I never made a pretence to him or you that I loved him. Iknew and father you knew and he knew that I never did. I was notwholly indifferent for I had a hope of being pleasant and useful toTom. But Tom had been the subject of all the little tenderness of mylife perhaps he became so because I knew so well how to pity him. Itmatters little now except as it may dispose you to think more lenientlyof his errors.""What can I do child Ask me what you will.""I am coming to it. Father chance has thrown into my way a newacquaintance a man such as I had had no experience of--light polishedeasy. I only wondered it should be worth his while who cared fornothing else to care so much for me. It matters little how he gained myconfidence. Father he did gain it. What you know of the story of mymarriage he soon knew just as well."Her father's face was ashy white."I have done no worse I have not disgraced you. This night my husbandbeing away he has been with me. This minute he expects me for I couldrelease myself of his presence by no other means. I do not know that Iam sorry or ashamed. All that I know is your philosophy and yourteaching will not save me. Father you have brought me to this. Save meby some other means"She fell insensible and he saw the pride of his heart and the triumphof his system lying at his feet. And it came to Thomas Gradgrind thatnight and on the morrow when he sat beside his daughter's bed thatthere was a wisdom of the heart no less than a wisdom of the head andthat in supposing the latter to be all sufficient he had erred.But no such change of mind took place in Mr. Bounderby. Finding his wife
comment466,absent he went at once to Stone Lodge and blustered in his usual way.Mr. Gradgrind tried to make him understand that the best thing to do wasto leave things as they were for a time and that Louisa who had beenso tried should stay on a visit to her father and be treated withtenderness and consideration. It was all wasted on Blunderby."Now I don't want to quarrel with you Tom Gradgrind" he retorted. "Ifyour daughter whom I made Loo Bounderby and might have done better byleaving Loo Gradgrind don't come home at noon to-morrow I shallunderstand that she prefers to stay away and you'll take charge of herin future. What I shall say to people in general of the incompatibilitythat led to my so laying down the law will be this I am JosiahBounderby she's the daughter of Tom Gradgrind and the two horseswouldn't pull together. I am pretty well known to be rather an uncommonman and most people will understand that it must be a woman rather outof the common who would come up to my mark. I have got no more to say.Good-night"At five minutes past twelve next day Mr. Bounderby directed his wife'sproperty to be carefully packed up and sent to Tom Gradgrind's and thenresumed a bachelor's life.Mr. James Harthouse learning from Louisa's maid--a young woman greatlyattached to her mistress--that his attentions were altogetherundesirable and that he would never see Mrs. Bounderby again decidedto throw up politics and leave Coketown at once. Which he did.Into how much of futurity did Mr. Bounderby see as he sat alone Had heany prescience of the day five years to come when Josiah Bounderby ofCoketown was to die in a fit in the Coketown street Could he foreseeMr. Gradgrind a white-haired man making his facts and figuressubservient to Faith Hope and Charity and no longer trying to grindthat Heavenly trio in his dusty little mills These things were to be.Could Louisa sitting alone in her father's house and gazing into thefire foresee the childless years before her Could she picture a lonelybrother flying from England after robbery and dying in a strange landconscious of his want of love and penitent These things were to be.Herself again a wife--a mother--lovingly watchful of her children evercareful that they should have a childhood of the mind no less than achildhood of the body as knowing it to be an even more beautiful thingand a possession any hoarded scrap of which is a blessing and happinessto the wisest Such a thing was never to be.                                   Little Dorrit      "Little Dorrit" was written at a time when the author was     busying himself not only with other literary work but also
comment467,     with semi-private theatricals. John Forster Charles Dickens's     biographer and friend even had some sort of fear at that time     that Dickens was in danger of adopting the stage as a     profession. Domestic troubles culminating a year later in the     separation from his wife also explain the restlessness and     general dissatisfaction which affected the great novelist in     the years 1855-57 when this story appeared. Hence there is no     surprise that "Little Dorrit" added but little to its author's     reputation. It is a very long book but it will never take a     front-rank place. The story however on its appearance in     monthly parts the first of which was published in January     1856 and the completed work in 1857 was enormously     successful beating in Dickens's own words "'Bleak House'     out of the field." Popular with the public it has never won     the critics._I.--The Father of the Marshalsea_Thirty years ago there stood a few doors short of the church of SaintGeorge in the Borough of Southwark on the left-hand side of the waygoing southward the Marshalsea Prison. It had stood there many yearsbefore and it remained there some years afterwards but it is gone nowand the world is none the worse without it.A debtor had been taken to the Marshalsea Prison a very amiable andvery helpless middle-aged gentleman who was perfectly clear--"like allthe rest of them" the turnkey on the lock said--that he was going outagain directly.The affairs of this debtor a shy retiring man with a mild voice andirresolute hands were perplexed by a partnership of which he knew nomore than that he had invested money in it."Out" said the turnkey. "He'll never get out unless his creditors takehim by the shoulders and shove him out"The next day the debtor's wife came to the Marshalsea bringing with hera little boy of three and a little girl of two."Two children" the turnkey observed to himself. "And you another whichmakes three and your wife another which makes four."Six months later a little girl was born to the debtor and when thischild was eight years old her mother who had long been languishingdied.The debtor had long grown accustomed to the place. Crushed at first byhis imprisonment he had soon found a dull relief in it. His elderchildren played regularly about the yard. If he had been a man withstrength of purpose he might have broken the net that held him orbroken his heart but being what he was he slipped easily into thissmooth descent and never more took one step upward.The shabby old debtor with the soft manners and the white hair becamethe Father of the Marshalsea. And he grew to be proud of the title. Allnewcomers were presented to him. He was punctilious in the exaction of
comment468,this ceremony. They were welcome to the Marshalsea he would tell them.It became a not unusual circumstance for letters to be put under hisdoor at night enclosing half-a-crown two half-crowns now and then atlong intervals even half a sovereign for the Father of the Marshalsea"With the compliments of a collegian taking leave." He received thegifts as tributes to a public character.Later he established the custom of attending collegians of a certainstanding to the gate and taking leave of them there. The collegianunder treatment would often wrap up something in a paper and give it tohim "For the Father of the Marshalsea."_II.--The Child of the Marshalsea_The youngest child of the Father of the Marshalsea born within thejail was a very very little creature indeed when she gained theknowledge that while her own light steps were free to pass beyond theprison gate her father's feet must never cross that line.At thirteen she could read and keep accounts--that is could put down inwords and figures how much the bare necessaries they needed would costand how much less they had to buy them with. From the first she wasinspired to be something which was not what the rest were and to bethat something for the sake of the rest. Recognised as useful evenindispensable she took the place of eldest of the three in all butprecedence was the head of the fallen family and bore in her ownheart its anxieties and shames. She had been by snatches of a fewweeks at a time to an evening school outside and got her sister andbrother sent to day schools by desultory starts during three or fouryears. There was no instruction for any of them at home but she knewwell--no one better--that a man so broken as to be the Father of theMarshalsea could be no father to his own children.To these scanty means of improvement she added others. Her sister Fannyhaving a great desire to learn dancing the Child of the Marshalseapersuaded a dancing-master detained for a short time to teach her. AndFanny became a dancer.There was a ruined uncle in the family group ruined by his brother theFather of the Marshalsea and knowing no more how than his ruiner didon whom Fanny's protection devolved. Naturally a retired and simple manhe had shown no particular sense of being ruined further than that heleft off washing when the shock was announced and never took to thatluxury any more. Having been a very indifferent musical amateur in hisbetter days when he fell with his brother he resorted for support toplaying a clarionet in a small theatre orchestra. It was the theatre in
comment469,which his niece became a dancer and he accepted the task of serving asher escort and guardian.To get her brother--christened Edward but called Tip--out of the prisonwas a more difficult task. Every post she obtained for him he alwaysgave up returning with the announcement that he was tired of it andhad cut it.One day he came back and said he was in for good that he had beentaken for forty pounds odd. For the first time in all those years shesank under her cares. It was so hard to make Tip understand that theFather of the Marshalsea must not know the truth about his son.For the Father of the Marshalsea as he grew more dependent on thecontributions of his changing family made the greater stand by hisforlorn gentility. So the pretence had to be kept up that neither of hisdaughters earned their bread.The Child of the Marshalsea learned needlework of an insolvent millinerand went out daily to work for a Mrs. Clennam.This was the life and this the history of the Child of the Marshalsea attwenty-two. Worldly wise in hard and poor necessities she was innocentin all things else. This was the life and this the history of LittleDorrit now going home upon a dull September evening and observed at adistance by Arthur Clennam. Arthur Clennam had returned to his mother'shouse--a dark and gloomy place--from the Far East. He had noticed thatLittle Dorrit appeared at eight and left at eight. She let herself outto do needlework he was told. What became of her between the two eightswas a mystery.It was not easy for Arthur Clennam to make out Little Dorrit's face sheplied her needle in such retired corners. But it seemed to be a paletransparent face quick in expression though not beautiful in feature.A delicately bent head a tiny form a quick little pair of busy handsand a shabby dress--shabby but very neat--were Little Dorrit as she satat work.Arthur Clennam watched Little Dorrit disappear within the outer gate ofthe Marshalsea and presently stopped an old man to ask what place itwas."This is the Marshalsea sir.""Can anyone go in here""Anyone can go in" replied the old man plainly implying "but it isnot everyone who can go out.""Pardon me once more. I am not impertinently curious. But are youfamiliar with the place Do you know the name of Dorrit here""My name sir" replied the old man "is Dorrit."Clennam explained that he had seen a young woman working at hismother's spoken of as Little Dorrit and had noticed her come in hereand that he was sincerely interested in her and wanted to knowsomething about her."I know very little of the world sir" replied the old man "it wouldnot be worth while to mislead me. The young woman whom you saw go in ismy brother's child. You say you have seen her at your mother's and havefelt an interest in her and wish to know what she does here. Come andsee."Arthur Clennam followed his guide to the room of the Father of theMarshalsea."I found this gentleman" said the uncle--"Mr. Clennam William son ofAmy's friend--at the outer gate wishful as he was going by of payinghis respects. This is my brother William sir."
comment470,"Mr. Clennam" said William Dorrit "you are welcome sir pray sitdown. I have welcomed many visitors here."The Father of the Marshalsea went on to mention that he had beengratified by the testimonials of his visitors--the "very acceptabletestimonials."When Clennam left he presented his testimonial and the next morningfound him there again. He went out with Little Dorrit alone asked herif she had ever heard his mother's name before."No sir.""I am not asking from any reason that can cause you anxiety. You thinkthat at no time of your father's life was my name of Clennam everfamiliar to him""No sir. And oh I hope you will not misunderstand my father Don'tjudge him sir as you would judge others outside the gates. He has beenthere so long."They had walked some way before they returned. She was not working atMrs. Clennam's that day.The courtyard received them at last and there he said good-bye toLittle Dorrit. Little as she had always looked she looked less thanever when he saw her going into the Marshalsea Lodge passage.Aware that his mother might have once averted the ruin of the Dorritfamily Clennam returned more than once to the Marshalsea. No word oflove crossed his lips he told Little Dorrit to think of him as an oldman old enough to be her father and he besought her only to let himknow if at any time he could do her service. "I press for no confidencenow. I only ask you to repose unhesitating trust in me" he said."Can I do less than that when you are so good""Then you will trust me fully Will have no secret unhappiness oranxiety concealed from me""Almost none."But if Arthur Clennam kept silent Little Dorrit was not without alover. Years ago young John Chivery the sentimental son of the turnkeyhad eyed her with admiring wonder. There seemed to young John a fitnessin the attachment. She the Child of the Marshalsea he thelock-keeper. Every Sunday young John presented cigars to the Father ofthe Marshalsea--who was glad to get them--and one particular Sundayafternoon he mustered up courage to urge his suit.Little Dorrit was out walking on the Iron Bridge when young John foundher."Miss Amy" he stammered "I have had for a long time--ages they seem tome--a heart-cherished wish to say something to you. May I say it May IMiss Amy I but ask the question humbly--may I say it I know very wellyour family is far above mine. It were vain to conceal it. I know verywell that your high-souled brother and likewise your spirited sisterspurn me from a height.""If you please John Chivery" Little Dorrit answered in a quiet way
comment471,"since you are so considerate as to ask me whether you shall say anymore--if you please no.""Never Miss Amy""No if you please. Never.""Oh Lord" gasped young John."When you think of us John--I mean my brother and sister and me--don'tthink of us as being any different from the rest for whatever we oncewere we ceased to be long ago and never can be any more. And good-byeJohn. And I hope you will have a good wife one day and be a happy man.I am sure you will deserve to be happy and you will be John.""Good-bye Miss Amy. Good-bye"_III.--The Marshalsea Becomes an Orphan_It turned out that Mr. Dorrit being of the Dorrits of Dorsetshire washeir-at-law to a great fortune. Inquiries and investigations confirmedit.Arthur Clennam broke the news to Little Dorrit and together they wentto the Marshalsea. William Dorrit was sitting in his old grey gown andhis old black cap in the sunlight by the window when they entered."Father Mr. Clennam has brought me such joyful and wonderfulintelligence about you"Her agitation was great and the old man put his hand suddenly to hisheart and looked at Clennam."Tell me Mr. Dorrit what surprise would be the most unlocked for andthe most acceptable to you. Do not be afraid to imagine it or to saywhat it would be."He looked steadfastly at Clennam and so looking at him seemed tochange into a very old haggard man. The sun was bright upon the wallbeyond the window and on the spikes at the top. He slowly stretched outthe hand that had been upon his heart and pointed at the wall."It is down" said Clennam. "Gone And in its place are the means topossess and enjoy the utmost that they have so long shut out. Mr.Dorrit there is not the smallest doubt that within a few days you willbe free and highly prosperous."They had to fetch wine for the old man and when he had swallowed alittle he leaned back in his chair and cried. But he quickly recoveredand announced that everybody concerned should be nobly rewarded."No one my dear sir shall say that he has an unsatisfied claim againstme. Everybody shall be remembered. I will not go away from here inanybody's debt. I particularly wish to act munificently Mr. Clennam."Clennam's offer of money for present contingencies was at once accepted."I am obliged to you for the temporary accommodation sir. Exceedinglytemporary but well timed--well timed. Be so kind sir as to add theamount to former advances."He grew more composed presently and then when he seemed to be fallingasleep unexpectedly sat up and said "Mr. Clennam am I to understandmy dear sir that I could pass through the lodge at this moment andtake a walk""I think not Mr. Dorrit" was the unwilling reply. "There are certainforms to be completed. It is but a few hours now.""A few hours sir" he returned in a sudden passion. "You talk veryeasily of hours sir How long do you suppose sir that an hour is to aman who is choking for want of air"It was his last demonstration for that time but in the interval before
comment472,the day of his departure he was very imperious with the lawyersconcerned in his release and a good deal of business was transacted.Mr. Arthur Clennam received a cheque for 24 93. 8d. from the solicitorsof Edward Dorrit Esq.--once "Tip"--with a note that the favour of theadvance now repaid had not been asked of him.To the applications made by collegians within the so-soon-to-be-orphanedMarshalsea for small sums of money Mr. Dorrit responded with thegreatest liberality. He also invited the whole College to acomprehensive entertainment in the yard and went about among thecompany on that occasion and took notice of individuals like a baronof the olden time in a rare good humour.And now the final hour arrived when he and his family were to leave theprison for ever. The carriage was reported ready in the outer courtyard.Mr. Dorrit and his brother proceeded arm in arm Edward Dorrit Esq.and his sister Fanny followed also arm in arm.There was not a collegian within doors nor a turnkey absent as theycrossed the yard. Mr. Dorrit--whose meat and drink had many a time beenbought with money presented by some of those who stood to watch himgo--yielding to the vast speculation how the poor creatures were to geton without him was great and sad but not absorbed. He patted childrenon the head like Sir Roger de Coverley going to church spoke to peoplein the background by their Christian names and condescended to allpresent.At last three honest cheers announced that he had passed the gate andthat the Marshalsea was an orphan.Only when the family had got into their carriage and not before MissFanny exclaimed "Good gracious I Where's Amy"Her father had thought she was with her sister. Her sister had thoughtshe was somewhere or other. They had all trusted to find her as theyhad always done quietly in the right place at the right moment. Thisgoing away was perhaps the very first action of their joint lives thatthey had got through without her."Now I do say Pa" cried Miss Fanny flushed and indignant "that thisis disgraceful Here is that child Amy in her ugly old shabby dress.Disgracing us at the last moment by being carried out in that dressafter all. And by that Mr. Clennam too"Clennam appeared at the carriage-door bearing the little insensiblefigure in his arms."She has been forgotten" he said. "I ran up to her room and found thedoor open and that she had fainted on the floor."They received her in the carriage and the attendant getting betweenClennam and the carriage-door with a sharp "By your leave sir"bundled up the steps and drove away._IV.--Another Prisoner in the Marshalsea_The Dorrit family travelled abroad in handsome style and in due timeMiss Fanny married.A sudden seizure carried off old Mr. Dorrit and he died thinkinghimself back in the Marshalsea. His brother Frederick stricken withgrief did not long survive him.Arthur Clennam who had gone into partnership with a friend named Doyceunfortunately invested his money in the financial schemes of Mr. Merdlethe greatest swindler of the day and when the crash came and Merdlecommitted suicide Clennam with hundreds of other innocent persons wasinvolved in the general ruin.Doyce was working at the time in Germany and it was some weeks beforehe could be found in the meantime Clennam being insolvent was takento the Marshalsea.Mr. Chivery was on the lock and young John was in the lodge when theMarshalsea was reached. The elder Mr. Chivery shook hands with him in ashamefaced kind of way and said "I don't call to mind sir as I wasever less glad to see you."The prisoner followed young John up the old staircase into the old room."I thought you'd like the room and here it is for you" said youngJohn.Young John waited upon him and it was young John who explained that he
comment473,did this not on the ground of the prisoner's merits but because of themerits of another of one who loved the prisoner. Clennam tried to argueto himself the improbability of Little Dorrit loving him but he wasn'taltogether successful.He fell ill and it was Little Dorrit whose living presence firstcheered him when he returned from the world of feverish dreams andshadows.He did his best to dissuade her from coming. He was a ruined man andthe time when Little Dorrit and the prison had anything in common hadlong gone by.But still she came and often read to him. And one day she told him thatall her money had gone as his had gone lost in the Merdle whirlpooland that her sister Fanny's was lost too in the same way."I have nothing in the world. I am as poor as when I lived here. Whenpapa came over to England just before his death he confided everythinghe had to the same hands and it is all swept away. Oh my dearest andbest are you quite sure you will not share my fortune with me"Locked in his arms held to his heart she drew the slight hand roundhis neck and clasped it in its fellow-hand.Of course when Doyce who was a thoroughly good fellow and successfulto boot found out his partner's plight he came back and put thingsright and the business was soon set going again.And on the very day of his release Arthur Clennam and Little Dorritwent into the neighbouring church of St. George and were married Doycegiving the bride away.Little Dorrit and her husband walked out of the church alone when thesigning of the register was done.They paused for a moment on the steps of the portico and then went downinto the roaring streets inseparable and blessed.                                   Martin Chuzzlewit      On its monthly publication in 1843-44 "Martin Chuzzlewit"     was pecuniarily the least successful of Dickens's serials     though popular as a book. It was his first novel after his     American tour and the storm of resentment that had hailed the     appearance of "American Notes" in 1842 was intensified by     his merciless satire of American characteristics and     institutions in "Martin Chuzzlewit." Despite all adverse     criticism however "Chuzzlewit" is worthy to rank with     anything that ever came from the pen of the great Victorian     novelist. It is a very long story and a very full one the     canvas is crowded with a gallery of typical Dickensian people.
comment474,     Through Mrs. Gamp Dickens dealt a death-blow to the drunken     nurse of the period. The name Pecksniff has become synonymous     with a certain type of hypocrite and the adjective     Pecksniffian is in common use wherever the English language is     spoken. Charged with exaggeration regarding Mr. Pecksniff     Dickens wrote in the preface to "Martin Chuzzlewit" "All the     Pecksniff family upon earth are quite agreed I believe that     no such character ever existed. I will not offer any plea on     his behalf to so powerful and genteel a body." Mrs. Gamp     though one of the humorous types that have perhaps     contributed most largely to the fame of Dickens does not     appear in this epitome the character being a minor one in the     development of the story._I.--Mr. Pecksniff's New Pupil_Mr. Pecksniff lived in a little Wiltshire village within an easy journeyof Salisbury.The brazen plate upon his door bore the inscription "PecksniffArchitect" to which Mr. Pecksniff on his cards of business added"and Land Surveyor." Of his architectural doings nothing was clearlyknown except that he had never designed or built anything.Mr. Pecksniff's professional engagements indeed were almost if notentirely confined to the reception of pupils. His genius lay inensnaring parents and guardians and pocketing premiums.Mr. Pecksniff was a moral man. Perhaps there never was a more moral manthan Mr. Pecksniff especially in his conversation and correspondence.Some people likened him to a direction-post which is always telling theway to a place and never goes there but these were his enemies.Into Mr. Pecksniff's house came young Martin Chuzzlewit a relation ofthe architect's. Tom Pinch Mr. Pecksniff's assistant had driven overto Salisbury for the new pupil and had already discoursed to Martin onMr. Pecksniff and his family for Mr. Pecksniff had twodaughters--Mercy and Charity in whose good qualities he had aprofound and pathetic belief.Festive preparations on a rather extensive scale were already completedfor Martin's benefit on the night of his arrival. There were two bottlesof currant wine white and red a dish of sandwiches very long andvery slim another of apples another of captain's biscuits a plate oforanges cut up small and gritty with powdered sugar and a highlygeological home-made cake. The magnitude of these preparations quitetook away Tom Pinch's breath for though the new pupils were usually letdown softly particularly in the wine department still this was abanquet a sort of lord mayor's feast in private life a something tothink of and hold on by afterwards.To this entertainment Mr. Pecksniff besought the company to do fulljustice."Martin" he said addressing his daughters "will seat himself betweenyou two my dears and Mr. Pinch will come by me. This is a minglingthat repays one for much disappointment and vexation. Let us be merry."Here he took a captain's biscuit. "It is a poor heart that neverrejoices and our hearts are not poor. No"The following morning Mr. Pecksniff announced that he must go to London."On professional business my dear Martin strictly on professional
comment475,business and I promised my girls long ago that they should accompanyme. We shall go forth to-night by the heavy coach--like the dove of oldmy dear Martin--and it will be a week before we again deposit ourolive-branches in the passage. When I say olive branches" observed Mr.Pecksniff in explanation "I mean our unpretending luggage.""And now let me see" said Mr. Pecksniff presently "how can you bestemploy yourself Martin while I am absent. Suppose you were to give meyour idea of a monument to a Lord Mayor of London or a tomb for asheriff or your notion of a cow-house to be erected in a nobleman'spark. A pump is a very chaste practice. I have found that a lamp-post iscalculated to refine the mind and give it a classical tendency. Anornamental turnpike has a remarkable effect upon the imagination. Whatdo you say to beginning with an ornamental turnpike""Whatever Mr. Pecksniff pleased" said Martin doubtfully."Stay" said that gentleman. "Come as you're ambitious and are a veryneat draughtsman you shall try your hand on these proposals for agrammar-school. When your mind requires to be refreshed by change ofoccupation Thomas Pinch will instruct you in the art of surveying theback-garden or in ascertaining the dead level of the road between thishouse and the finger-post or in any other practical and pleasingpursuit. There is a cart-load of loose bricks and a score or two of oldflower-pots in the back-yard. If you could pile them up my dear Martininto any form which would remind me on my return say of St. Peter's atRome or the Mosque of St. Sophia at Constantinople it would be at onceimproving to you and agreeable to my feelings."The coach having rolled away with the olive-branches in the boot andthe family of doves inside Martin Chuzzlewit and Tom Pinch were lefttogether. Now there was something in the very simplicity of Pinch thatinvited confidences and young Martin could not refrain from telling hisstory."I must talk openly to somebody" he began "I'll talk openly to you.You must know then that I have been bred up from childhood with greatexpectations and have always been taught to believe that one day Ishould be very rich. Certain things however have led to my beingdisinherited.""By your father" inquired Tom."By my grandfather. I have had no parents these many years. Now mygrandfather has a great many good points but he has two very greatfaults which are the staple of his bad side. He has the most confirmed
comment476,obstinacy of character and he is most abominably selfish I have heardthat these are failings of our family and I have to be very thankfulthat they haven't descended to me. Now I come to the cream of my storyand the occasion of my being here. I am in love Pinch. I am in lovewith one of the most beautiful girls the sun ever shone upon. But she iswholly and entirely dependent upon the pleasure of my grandfather andif he were to know that she favoured my passion she would lose her homeand everything she possesses in the world. My grandfather although I hadconducted myself from the first with the utmost circumspection is fullof jealousy and mistrust and suspected me of loving her. He saidnothing to her but attacked me in private and charged me withdesigning to corrupt the fidelity to himself--observe his selfishness--of a young creature who was his only disinterested and faithfulcompanion. The upshot of it was that I was to renounce her or berenounced by him. Of course I was not going to yield to him and here Iam"Mr. Pinch after staring at the fire said "Pecksniff of course youknew before""Only by name. My grandfather kept not only himself but me aloof fromall his relations. But our separation took place in a town in theneighbouring county. I saw Pecksniff's advertisement in the paper when Iwas at Salisbury and answered it having always had some natural tastein the matters to which it referred. I was doubly bent on coming to himif possible on account of his being--""Such an excellent man" interposed Tom rubbing his hands."Why not so much on that account" returned Martin "as because mygrandfather has an inveterate dislike to him and after the old man'sarbitrary treatment of me I had a natural desire to run as directlycounter to all his opinions as I could."_II.--Mr. Pecksniff Discharges His Duty_Mr. Pecksniff and his daughters took up their lodging in London at Mrs.Todgers's Commercial Boarding House and it was at that favoured abodethat old Martin Chuzzlewit whose grandson had just entered Mr.Pecksniff's house sought him out."I very much regret" said old Martin "that you and I held such aconversation as we did when we met awhile since. The intentions that Ibear towards you now are of another kind. Deserted by all in whom I haveever trusted hoodwinked and beset by all who should help and sustainme I fly to you for refuge. I confide in you to be my ally to attachyourself to me by ties of interest and expectations. I regret havingbeen severed from you so long."Mr. Pecksniff looked up to the ceiling and clasped his hands inrapture."I fear you don't know what an old man's humours are" resumed oldMartin. "You don't know what it is to be required to court his likingsand dislikings to do his bidding be it what it may. You have a newinmate in your house. He must quit it.""For--for yours" asked Mr. Pecksniff."For any shelter he can find. He has deceived you.""I hope not" said Mr. Pecksniff eagerly "I trust not. I have beenextremely well disposed towards that young man. Deceit--deceit my dearMr. Chuzzlewit would be final. I should hold myself bound on proof ofdeceit to renounce him instantly."
comment477,"Of course you know that he has made his matrimonial choice""Surely not without his grandfather's consent and approbation my dearsir" cried Mr. Pecksniff. "Don't tell me that. For the honour of humannature say you're not about to tell me that""I thought he had suppressed it."The indignation felt by Mr. Pecksniff at this terrible disclosure wasonly to be equalled by the kindling anger of his daughters. What hadthey taken to their hearth and home a secretely contracted serpentHorribleOld Martin then went on to inquire when they would be returning homeand after relieving Mr. Pecksniff's unexpressed anxiety by mentioningthat Mary Graham the young lady whom the old man had adopted wouldreceive nothing at his death announced that they might expect to seehim before long.With a hasty farewell the old man left the house followed to the doorby Mr. Pecksniff and his daughters. A few days later the Pecksniffs setout for home.Tom Pinch and Martin were both out in the lane to meet the coach butMr. Pecksniff pointedly ignored Martin's presence even when the househad been reached and it was not till Martin sharply demanded anexplanation that he addressed him."You have deceived me" said Mr. Pecksniff. "You have imposed upon anature which you knew to be confiding and unsuspicious. This lowly roofsir must not be contaminated by the presence of one who has furtherdeceived--and cruelly deceived--an honourable and venerable gentlemanand who wisely suppressed that deceit from me when he sought myprotection. I weep for your depravity. I mourn over your corruption butI cannot have a leper and a serpent for an inmate Go forth" said Mr.Pecksniff stretching out his hand "go forth young man Like all whoknow you I renounce you"Martin made a stride forward at these words and Mr. Pecksniff steppedback so hastily that he missed his footing tumbled over a chair andfell in a sitting posture on the ground where he remained perhapsconsidering it the safest place."Look at him Pinch" said Martin "as he lies there--a cloth for dirtyhands a mat for dirty feet a lying fawning servile hound And markme Pinch the day will come when even you will find him out"He pointed at him as he spoke with unutterable contempt and flinginghis hat upon his head walked from the house. He went on so rapidly thathe was clear of the village before Tom Pinch overtook him."Are you going" cried Tom."Yes" he answered sternly "I am.""Where" asked Tom."I don't know. Yes I do--to America."_III.--New Eden_Martin did not go to America alone for Mark Tapley formerly of theBlue Dragon an inn in the village where Mr. Pecksniff resided insistedon accompanying him."Now sir here am I without a sitiwation" Mr. Tapley put it "withoutany want of wages for a year to come--for I saved up I didn't mean todo it but I couldn't help it at the Dragon here am I with a likingfor what's wentersome and a liking for you and a wish to come out
comment478,strong under circumstances as would keep other men down--and will youtake me or will you leave me"Once landed in the United States the question of what to do arose andMartin decided to invest his savings in buying land in the risingtownship of New Eden."Mark you shall be a partner in the business" said Martin Mark havinginvested 37 to Martin's 8 "an equal partner with myself. We are nolonger master and servant. I will put in as my additional capital myprofessional knowledge and half the annual profits as long as it iscarried on shall be yours. Our business shall be commenced as soon aswe get to New Eden under the name of Chuzzlewit and Tapley.""Lord love you sir" cried Mark "don't have my name in it I must be'Co.' I must.""You shall have your own way Mark.""Thank 'ee sir If any country gentleman thereabouts in the public waywanted such a thing as a skittle-ground made I could take that part ofthe bis'ness sir."It was a long steamboat journey but at last they stopped at Eden. Thewaters of the Deluge might have left it but a week ago so choked withslime and matted growth was the hideous swamp which bore that name.A man advanced towards them when they landed walking slowly leaning ona stick."Strangers" he exclaimed."The very same" said Mark. "How are you sir""I've had the fever very bad" he answered faintly. "I haven't stoodupright these many weeks. My eldest son has a chill upon him. Myyoungest died last week.""I'm sorry for it governor with all my heart" said Mark. "The goodsis safe enough" he added turning to Martin and pointing to theirboxes. "There ain't many people about to make away with 'em. What acomfort that is""No" cried the man "we've buried most of 'em. The rest have gone away.Them that we have here don't come out at night.""The night air ain't quite wholesome I suppose" said Mark."It's deadly poison" was the answer.Mark showed no more uneasiness than if it had been commended to him asambrosia but he gave the man his arm and as they went along explainedthe nature of their purchase and inquired where it lay. Close to hisown log-house he said.It was a miserable cabin rudely constructed of the trunks of trees thedoor of which had either fallen down or been carried away. When they hadbrought up their chest Martin gave way and lay down on the ground andwept aloud."Lord love you sir" cried Mr. Tapley. "Don't do that. Anything butthat It never helped man woman or child over the lowest fence yetsir and it never will."Mark stole out gently in the morning while his companion slept and tooka rough survey of the settlement. There were not above a score of cabinsin the whole and half of these appeared untenanted. Their own land wasmere forest. He went down to the landing-place where they had lefttheir goods and there he found some half a dozen men wan and forlornwho helped him to carry them to the log-house.Martin was by this time stirring but he had greatly changed even inone night. He was very pale and languid and spoke of pains andweakness."Don't give in sir" said Mr. Tapley. "Why you must be ill. Wait halfa minute till I run up to one of our neighbours and find out what'sbest to be took."Martin was soon dangerously ill very near his death. Mark fatigued inmind and body working all the day and sitting up at night worn by hard
comment479,living surrounded by dismal and discouraging circumstances nevercomplained or yielded in the least degree. And then when Martin wasbetter Mark was taken ill. He fought against it but the malady foughtharder and his efforts were vain."Floored for the present sir" he said one morning sinking back uponhis bed "but jolly."And now it was Martin's turn to work and sit beside the bed and watchand listen through the long long nights to every sound in the gloomywilderness.Martin's reflections in those days slowly showed him his ownselfishness and when Mark Tapley recovered he found a singularalteration in his companion."I don't know what to make of him" he thought one night. "He don'tthink of himself half as much as he did. It's a swindle. There'll be nocredit in being jolly with _him_"The settlement was deserted. The only thing to be done was to return toEngland._IV.--The Downfall of Pecksniff_Old Martin Chuzzlewit had for some time taken up his residence at Mr.Pecksniff's and Martin and Mark Tapley went to the Blue Dragon on theirreturn.Martin at once sought out his grandfather and marched into the houseresolved on reconciliation. The old man listened to his appeal insilence but Mr. Pecksniff spoke for him and bade the young man begone.But old Martin was awake to Pecksniff's character and resolved to setMr. Pecksniff right and Mr. Pecksniff's victims too.Mark Tapley was the first person old Martin invited to see him. The oldman had gone to London and his grandson Mary Graham and Tom Pinchwere all summoned to wait on him at a certain hour.From Mark old Martin learnt that his grandson was an altered man."There was always a deal of good in him" said Mr. Tapley "but a littleof it got crusted over somehow. I can't say who rolled the paste of that'ere paste but--well I think it may have been you sir.""So you think" said Martin "that his old faults are in some degree ofmy creation""Well sir I'm very sorry but I can't unsay it. I don't believe thatneither of you ever gave the other a fair chance."Presently came a knock at the door and young Martin entered. The oldman pointed to a distant chair. Then came Tom Pinch and his sisterRuth and Mary Graham and Mrs. Lupin the landlady of the Blue Dragonand John Westlock an old friend of Tom Pinch's."Set the door open Mark" said Mr. Chuzzlewit.
comment480,The last appointed footstep sounded now upon the stairs. They all knewit. It was Mr. Pecksniff's and Mr. Pecksniff was in a hurry too forhe came bounding up with such uncommon expedition that he stumbled onceor twice."Where is my venerable friend" he cried upon the upper landing. Andthen darting in and catching sight of old Martin "My venerable friendis well"Mr. Pecksniff looked round upon the assembled group and shook his headreproachfully."Oh vermin" said Mr. Pecksniff. "Oh bloodsuckers Horde of unnaturalplunderers and robbers Leave him Leave him I say Begone AbscondYou had better be off Wander over the face of the earth young sirsand do not presume to remain in a spot which is hallowed by the greyhairs of the patriarchal gentleman to whose tottering limbs I have thehonour to act as an unworthy but I hope an unassuming prop and staff."He advanced with outstretched arms to take the old man's hand but hehad not seen how the hand clasped and clutched the stick within itsgrasp. As he came smiling on and got within his reach old Martinburning with indignation rose up and struck him to the ground."Drag him away Take him out of my reach" said Martin. And Mr. Tapleyactually did drag him away and struck him upon the floor with his backagainst the opposite wall."Hear me rascal" said Mr. Chuzzlewit. "I have summoned you here towitness your own work. Come hither my dear Martin Why did we everpart How could we ever part How could you fly from me to him Thefault was mine no less than yours. Mark has told me so and I have knownit long. Mary my love come here."She trembled and was very pale but he sat her in his own chair andstood beside it holding her hand Martin standing by him."The curse of our house" said the old man looking kindly down uponher "has been the love of self--has ever been the love of self." Hedrew one hand through Martin's arm and standing so between themproceeded "What's this Her hand is trembling strangely. See if you canhold it."Hold it If he clasped it half as tightly as he did her waist--wellwellBut it was good in him that even then in high fortune and happiness hehad still a hand left to stretch out to Tom Pinch.                                   Nicholas Nickleby      Writing in 1848 Charles Dickens declared that when "Nicholas     Nickleby" was begun in 1838 "there were then a good many-cheap     Yorkshire schools in existence. There are very few now." In     the preface to the completed book the author mentioned that     more than one Yorkshire schoolmaster laid claim to be the     original of Squeers and he had reason to believe "one worthy     has actually consulted authorities learned in the law as to     his having good grounds on which to rest an action for libel."     But Squeers as Dickens insisted was the representative of a     class and not an individual. The Brothers Cheeryble were "no     creations of the author's brain" Dickens also wrote and in     consequence of this statement "hundreds upon hundreds of
comment481,     letters from all sorts of people" poured in upon him to be     forwarded "to the originals of the Brothers Cheeryble." They     were the Brothers Grant cotton-spinners near Manchester.     "Nicholas Nickleby" was completed in October 1839._I.--A Yorkshire Schoolmaster_Mr. Nickleby a country gentleman of small estate having endeavoured toincrease his scanty fortune by speculation found himself ruined hetook to his bed apparently resolved to keep that at all events andafter embracing his wife and children very soon departed this life. SoMrs. Nickleby went to London to wait upon her brother-in-law Mr. RalphNickleby and with her two children Nicholas then nineteen and Katea year or two younger took lodgings in the Strand.It was to these apartments that Ralph Nickleby a hard unscrupulouscunning money-lender came on receipt of the widow's note."Are you willing to work sir" said Ralph frowning at his nephew."Of course I am" replied Nicholas haughtily."Then see here" said his uncle. "This caught my eyes this morning andyou may thank your stars for it."With that Mr. Ralph Nickleby took a newspaper from his pocket and readthe following advertisement."_Education_.--At Mr. Wackford Squeers' Academy Dotheboys Hall at thedelightful village of Dotheboys in Yorkshire youths are boardedclothed booked furnished with pocket-money instructed in alllanguages living or dead mathematics orthography geometrytrigonometry the use of the globes algebra single-stick ifrequired writing arithmetic fortification and every other branch ofclassic literature. Terms twenty guineas per annum. No extras novacations and diet unparalleled. Mr. Squeers is in town and attendsdaily from one till four at the Saracen's Head Snow Hill. N.B.--An ableassistant wanted. Annual salary 5 A Master of Arts would bepreferred.""There" said Ralph folding the paper again. "Let him get thatsituation and his fortune's made. If he don't like that let him get onefor himself.""I am ready to do anything you wish me" said Nicholas starting gailyup. "Let us try our fortune with Mr. Squeers at once he can butrefuse.""He won't do that" said Ralph. "He will be glad to have you on myrecommendation. Make yourself of use to him and you'll rise to be apartner in the establishment in no time."Nicholas having taken down the address of Mr. Wackford Squeers theuncle and nephew at once went forth in quest of that accomplishedgentleman."Perhaps you recollect me" said Ralph looking narrowly at theschoolmaster as the Saracen's Head."You paid me a small account at each of my half-yearly visits to townfor some years I think sir" replied Squeers "for the parents of aboy who unfortunately----""Unfortunately died at Dotheboys Hall" said Ralph finishing thesentence. "And now let us come to business. You have advertised for anassistant. Do you really want one""Certainly" answered Squeers."Here he is" said Ralph. "My nephew Nicholas hot from school is justthe man you want.""I am afraid" said Squeers perplexed with such an application from ayouth of Nicholas's figure--"I am afraid the young man won't suit me.""I fear sir" said Nicholas "that you object to my youth and to notbeing a Master of Arts""The absence of the college degree _is_ an objection." replied Squeersconsiderably puzzled by the contrast between the simplicity of thenephew and the shrewdness of the uncle."Let me have two words with you" said Ralph. The two words were hadapart in a couple of minutes Mr. Wackford Squeers' announced that Mr.Nicholas Nickleby was from that moment installed in the office of firstassistant master at Dotheboys Hall."At eight o'clock to-morrow morning Mr. Nickleby" said Squeers "thecoach starts. You must be here at a quarter before as we take some boyswith us.""And your fare down I have paid" growled Ralph. "So you'll have nothingto do but keep yourself warm."_II.--At Dotheboys Hall_"Past seven Nickleby" said Mr. Squeers on the first morning after thearrival at Dotheboys Hall. "Come tumble up. Here's a pretty go the
comment482,pump's froze. You can't wash yourself this morning so you must becontent with giving yourself a dry polish till we break the ice in thewell and can get a bucketful out for the boys."Nicholas huddled on his clothes and followed Squeers across a yard tothe school-room."There" said the schoolmaster as they stepped in together "this isour shop."It was a bare and dirty room the windows mostly stopped up with oldcopybooks and paper and Nicholas looked with dismay at the old ricketydesks and forms.But the pupilsPale and haggard faces lank and bony figures boys of stunted growthand others whose long and meagre legs would hardly bear their stoopingbodies. Faces that told of young lives which from infancy had been onehorrible endurance of cruelty and neglect. Little faces that should havebeen handsome darkened with the scowl of sullen dogged suffering. Andyet painful as the scene was it had its grotesque features.Mrs. Squeers wearing a beaver bonnet of some antiquity on the top of anightcap stood at the desk presiding over an immense basin ofbrimstone and treacle. This compound she administered to each boy insuccession using an enormous wooden spoon for the purpose."We purify the boys' blood now and then Nickleby" said Squeers whenthe operation was over.A meagre breakfast followed and then Mr. Squeers made his way to hisdesk and called up the first class."This is the first class in English spelling and philosophy Nickleby"said Squeers beckoning Nicholas to stand beside him. "Now then where'sthe first boy""Please sir he's cleaning the back parlour window.""So he is to be sure" replied Squeers. "We go upon the practical modeof teaching Nickleby the regular education system. C-l-e-a-n cleanverb active to make bright. W-i-n win d-e-r winder a casement. Whenthe boy knows this out of a book he goes and does it. Where's thesecond boy""Please sir he's weeding the garden.""So he is" said Squeers. B-o-t bot t-i-n bottin n-e-y neybottiney noun substantive a knowledge of plants. When he has learnedthat bottiney means a knowledge of plants he goes and knows 'em. That'sour system Nickleby. Third boy what's a horse""A beast sir" replied the boy."So it is" said Squeers. "A horse is a quadruped and quadruped's Latinfor beast as everybody that's gone through the grammar knows. As you'reperfect in that go and look after _my_ horse and rub him down well orI'll rub you down. The rest of the class go and draw water up tillsomebody tells you to leave off for it's washing day to-morrow andthey want the coppers filled."The deficiencies of Mr. Squeers' scholastic methods were made up bylavish punishments and Nicholas was compelled to stand by every day andsee the unfortunate pupils of Dotheboys Hall beaten without mercy andknow that he could do nothing to alleviate their misery.In particular the plight of one poor boy older than the rest calledSmike a drudge whom starvation and ill-treatment had rendered dull andslow-witted aroused all Nicholas's pity.It was Smike who was the cause of Nicholas leaving Yorkshire.Nicholas could endure the coarse and brutal language of Squeers thedispleasure of Mrs. Squeers who decided that the new usher was "aproud haughty consequential turned-up-nosed peacock" and that "she'dbring his pride down" and the petty indignities this lady couldinflict upon him. He bore with the bad food dirty lodging and dailyround of squalid misery in the school.But there came a day when Smike unable to face his tormentors anylonger ran away. He was taken within four-and-twenty hours and broughtback bedabbled with mud and rain haggard and worn--to all appearance
comment483,more dead than alive.The work this unhappy drudge performed would have cost the establishmentsome ten or twelve shillings a week in the way of wages and Squeerswho as a matter of policy made severe examples of all runaways fromDotheboys Hall prepared to take full vengeance on Smike.At the first blow Smike uttered a shriek of pain and Nicholas Nicklebystarted up from his desk and cried "Stop" in a furious voice."Touch that boy at your peril. I will not stand by and see it done."He had scarcely spoken when Squeers in a violent outbreak of wrathspat upon him and struck him across the face with his cane.All Nicholas's feelings of rage scorn and indignation wereconcentrated into that moment and smarting at the blow he sprang uponthe schoolmaster wrested the weapon from him and pinning him by thethroat beat the ruffian until he roared for mercy.Mrs. Squeers with many shrieks for aid hung on to the tail of herpartner's coat and tried to drag him from his infuriated adversary.With the result that when Nicholas having thrown all his remainingstrength into a half dozen finishing cuts flung the schoolmaster fromhim with all the force he could muster Mrs. Squeers was precipitatedover an adjacent form and Squeers striking his head against it in hisdescent lay at full length on the ground stunned and motionless.Nicholas assured that Squeers was only stunned and not dead left theroom packed up his few clothes in a small leathern valise marchedboldly out by the front door and struck into the road for London._III.--Brighter Days for Nicholas_After many adventures in the quest of fortune Nicholas who had spurnedall further connection with his uncle stood one day outside a registryoffice in London. And as he stood there looking at the various placardsin the window an old gentleman a sturdy old fellow in broad-skirtedblue coat happened to stop too.Nicholas caught the old gentleman's eye and began to wonder whether thestranger could by any possibility be looking for a clerk or secretary.As the old gentleman moved away he noticed that Nicholas was about tospeak and good-naturedly stood still."I was only going to say" said Nicholas "that I hoped you had someobject in consulting those advertisements in the window.""Ay ay what object now" returned the old gentleman. "Did you think Iwanted a situation now eh I thought the same of you at first upon myword I did.""If you had thought so at last too sir you would not have been farfrom the truth" rejoined Nicholas. "The kindness of your face andmanner--both so unlike any I have ever seen--tempt me to speak in a wayI should never dream of doing to a stranger in this wilderness ofLondon.""Wilderness Yes it is it is. It was a wilderness to me once. I camehere barefoot--I have never forgotten it. What's the matter how did itall come about" said the old man laying his hand on the shoulder ofNicholas and walking him up the street. "In mourning too eh" layinghis finger on the sleeve of his black coat."My father" replied Nicholas."Bad thing for a young man to lose his father. Widowed mother perhaps"Nicholas nodded."Brothers and sisters too eh""One sister.""Poor thing poor thing You're a scholar too I dare say. Education's agreat thing. I never had any. I admire it the more in others. A veryfine thing. Tell me more of your history all of it. No impertinentcuriosity--no no"There was something so earnest and guileless in the way this was saidthat Nicholas could not resist it. So he told his story and at theend the old gentleman carried him straight off to the City where theyemerged in a quiet shady square. The old gentleman led the way intosome business premises which had the inscription "Cheeryble Brothers"on the doorpost and stopped to speak to an elderly large-faced clerkin the counting-house."Is my brother in his room Tim" said Mr. Cheeryble.
comment484,"Yes he is sir" said the clerk.What was the amazement of Nicholas when his conductor took him into aroom and presented him to another old gentleman the very type and modelof himself--the same face and figure the same clothes. Nobody couldhave doubted their being twin brothers."Brother Ned" said Nicholas's friend "here is a young friend of minethat we must assist." Then brother Charles related what Nicholas hadtold him. And after that and some conversation between the brothersTim Linkinwater was called in and brother Ned whispered a few words inhis ear."Tim" said brother Charles "you understand that we have an intentionof taking this young gentleman into the counting-house."Brother Ned remarked that Tim quite approved of it and Tim havingnodded said with resolution "But I'm not coming an hour later in themorning you know. I'm not going to the country either. It's forty-fouryears since I first kept the books of Cheeryble Brothers. I've openedthe safe all that time every morning at nine and I've never slept outof the back attic one single night. This ain't the first time you'vetalked about superannuating me Mr. Edwin and Mr. Charles but if youplease we'll make it the last and drop the subject for evermore."With which words Tim Linkinwater stalked out with the air of a man whowas thoroughly resolved not to be put down.The brothers coughed."He must be done something with brother Ned. We must disregard hisscruples he must be made a partner.""Quite right quite right brother Charles. If he won't listen toreason we must do it against his will. But in the meantime we arekeeping our young friend and the poor lady and her daughter will beanxious for his return. So let us say good-bye for the present." And atthat the brothers hurried Nicholas out of the office shaking hands withhim all the way.That was the beginning of brighter days for Nicholas and for Mrs.Nickleby and Kate. The brothers Cheeryble not only took Nicholas intotheir office but a small cottage at Bow then quite out in the countrywas found for the widow and her children.There never was such a week of discoveries and surprises as the firstweek at that cottage. Every night when Nicholas came home something newhad been found. One day it was a grape-vine and another day it was aboiler and another day it was the key of the front parlour cupboard atthe bottom of the water-butt and so on through a hundred items.As for Nicholas's work in the counting-house Tim Linkinwater wassatisfied with the young man the very first day.Tim turned pale and stood watching with breathless anxiety when Nicholasmade his first entry in the books of Cheeryble Brothers while the twobrothers looked on with smiling faces.Presently the old clerk nodded his head signifying "He'll do." But whenNicholas stopped to refer to some other page Tim Linkinwater unable torestrain his satisfaction any longer descended from his stool andcaught him rapturously by the hand."He has done it" said Tim looking round triumphantly at his employers."His capital 'B's' and 'D's' are exactly like mine he dots his small
comment485,'i's' and crosses every 't.' There ain't such a young man in all London.The City can't produce his equal. I challenge the City to do it"_IV.--The Brothers Cheeryble_In course of time the brothers Cheeryble in their frequent visits tothe cottage at Bow often took with them their nephew Frank and it alsohappened that Miss Madeline Bray a ward of the brothers was taken tothe cottage to recover from a serious illness.Nicholas from the first time he had seen Madeline in the office ofCheeryble Brothers had fallen in love with her but he decided that asan honourable man no word of love must pass his lips. While KateNickleby had been equally firm in declining to listen to any proposalfrom Frank.It was some time after Madeline had left the cottage and Nicholas andKate had begun to try in good earnest to stifle their own regrets andto live for each other and for their mother when there came oneevening per Mr. Linkinwater an invitation from the brothers to dinneron the next day but one."You may depend on it that this means something besides dinner" saidMrs. Nickleby solemnly.When the great day arrived who should be there at the house of thebrothers but Frank and Madeline."Young men" said brother Charles "shake hands.""I need no bidding to do that" said Nicholas."Nor I" rejoined Frank and the two young men clasped hands heartily.The old gentleman took them aside."I wish to see you friends--close and firm friends. Frank look hereMrs. Nickleby will you come on the other side This is a copy of thewill of Madeline's grandfather bequeathing her the sum of 12000. NowFrank you were largely instrumental in recovering this document. Thefortune is but a small one but we love Madeline. Will you become asuitor for her hand""No sir. I interested myself in the recovery of that instrumentbelieving that her hand was already pledged elsewhere. In this itseems I judged hastily.""As you always do sir" cried brother Charles. "How dare you thinkFrank that we could have you marry for money How dare you go and makelove to Mr. Nickleby's sister without telling us first and letting usspeak for you. Mr. Nickleby sir Frank judged hastily but he judgedfor once correctly. Madeline's heart is occupied--give me your hand--itis occupied by you and worthily. She chooses you Mr. Nickleby as weher dearest friends would have her choose. Frank chooses as we wouldhave _him_ choose. He should have your sister's little hand sir if shehad refused it a score of times--ay he should and he shall What Youare the children of a worthy gentleman. The time was sir when mybrother Ned and I were two poor simple-hearted boys wandering almostbarefoot to seek bur fortunes. Oh Ned Ned Ned what a happy day thisis for you and me If our poor mother had only lived to see us now Ned
comment486,how proud it would have made her dear heart at last"So Madeline gave her heart and fortune to Nicholas and on the same dayand at the same time Kate became Mrs. Frank Cheeryble. Madeline's moneywas invested in the firm of Cheeryble Brothers in which Nicholas hadbecome a partner and before many years elapsed the business was carriedon in the names of "Cheeryble and Nickleby."Tim Linkinwater condescended after much entreating and brow-beating toaccept a share in the house but he could never be prevailed upon tosuffer the publication of his name as partner and always persisted inthe punctual and regular discharge of his clerkly duties.The twin brothers retired. Who needs to be told that they were happyThe first act of Nicholas when he became a rich and prosperousmerchant was to buy his father's old house. As time crept on and therecame gradually about him a group of lovely children it was altered andenlarged but no tree was rooted up nothing with which there was anyassociation of bygone times was ever removed or changed. Mr. Squeershaving come within the meshes of the law over some nefarious scheme ofRalph Nickleby's suffered transportation beyond the seas and with hisdisappearance Dotheboys Hall was broken up for good.                                   Oliver Twist      "The Adventures of Oliver Twist" published serially in     "Bentley's Miscellany" 1837-39 and in book form in 1838 was     the second of Dickens's novels. It lacks the exuberance of     "Pickwick" and is more limited in its scenes and characters     than any other novel he wrote excepting "Hard Times" and     "Great Expectations." But the description of the workhouse     its inmates and governors is done in Dickens's best style     and was a frontal attack on the Poor Law administration of the     time. Bumble indeed has passed into common use as the     typical workhouse official of the least satisfactory sort. No     less powerful than the picture of Oliver's wretched childhood     is the description of the thieves' kitchen presided over by     Fagin. Bill Sikes and the Artful Dodger are household words     for criminals and the character of Fagin is drawn with     wonderful skill in this terrible view of the underworld of     London._I.--The Parish Boy_Oliver was born in the workhouse and his mother died the same night.
comment487,Not even a promised reward of 10 could produce any information as tothe boy's father or the mother's name. The woman was young frail anddelicate--a stranger to the parish."How comes he to have any name at all then" said Mrs. Mann who wasresponsible for the early bringing up of the workhouse children to Mr.Bumble the parish beadle.The beadle drew himself up with great pride and said "I invented it.We name our foundings in alphabetical order. The last was a S Swubble Inamed him. This was a T Twist I named _him_. I have got names readymade to the end of the alphabet and all the way through it again whenwe come to Z.""Why you're quite a literary character sir" said Mrs. Mann.Oliver being now nine years old was removed from the tender mercies ofMrs. Mann in whose wretched home not one kind word or look had everlighted the gloom of his infant years and was taken into the workhouse.Now the members of the board who were long-headed men had justestablished the rule that all poor people should have the alternativefor they would compel nobody not they of being starved by a gradualprocess in the house or by a quick one out of it. All relief wasinseparable from the workhouse and the thin gruel issued three times aday to its inmates.The system was in full operation for the first six months after OliverTwist's admission and boys having generally excellent appetites OliverTwist and his companions suffered the tortures of slow starvation. Eachboy had one porringer of gruel and no more. At last the boys got sovoracious and wild with hunger that one who was tall for his age andhadn't been used to that sort of thing for his father had kept a smallcook's shop hinted darkly to his companions that unless he had anotherbasin of gruel _per diem_ he was afraid he might some night happen toeat the boy who slept next him a weakly youth of tender age. He had awild hungry eye and they implicitly believed him. A council was heldlots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper thatevening and ask for more and it fell to Oliver Twist.The evening arrived the boys took their places. The master in hiscook's uniform stationed himself at the copper to ladle out the gruelhis pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him the gruel was servedout and a long grace was said over the short commons.The gruel disappeared the boys whispered to each other and winked atOliver while his next neighbours nudged him. Child as he was he wasdesperate with hunger and reckless with misery. He rose from the tableand advancing to the master basin and spoon in hand said somewhatalarmed at his own temerity "Please sir I want some more."The master was a fat healthy man but he turned very pale. He gazed in
comment488,stupified astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds and thensaid "What""Please sir" replied Oliver "I want some more."The master aimed a blow at Oliver's head with the ladle pinioned him inhis arms and shrieked aloud for the beadle.The board were sitting in solemn conclave when Mr. Bumble rushed intothe room in great excitement and addressing a gentleman in a highchair said "Mr. Limbkins I beg your pardon sir Oliver Twist hasasked for more"There was a general start. Horror was depicted on every countenance."For _more_" said the chairman. "Compose yourself Bumble and answerme distinctly. Do I understand that he asked for more after he hadeaten the supper allotted by the dietary""He did sir" replied Bumble."That boy will be hung" said a gentleman in a white waistcoat. "I knowthat boy will be hung."Nobody disputed the opinion. Oliver was ordered into instantconfinement and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of theworkhouse gate offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who wouldtake Oliver Twist off their hands. In other words five pounds andOliver Twist were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprenticeto any trade business or calling.Mr. Gamfield the chimney sweep was the first to respond to this offer."It's a nasty trade" said the chairman of the board."Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now" said anothermember."That's because they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbleyto make 'em come down again" said Gamfield. "That's all smoke and noblaze vereas smoke only sinds him to sleep and that ain't no use inmaking a boy come down. Boys is wery obstinite and wery lazy gen'l'menand there's nothink like a good hot blaze to make 'em come down with arun. It's humane too gen'l'men acause even if they've stuck in thechimbley roasting their feet makes 'em struggle to hextricatetheirselves."The board consented to hand over Oliver to the chimney-sweep thepremium being reduced to 3 10s. but the magistrates declined tosanction the indentures and it was Mr. Sowerberry the undertaker whofinally relieved the board of their responsibility.Mrs. Sowerberry's ill-treatment drove Oliver to flight. He left thehouse in the early morning before anyone was stirring struck acrossfields and gained the high road outside the town. A milestone intimatedthat it was seventy miles to London. In London he would be beyond thereach of Mr. Bumble to London he would trudge._II.--The Artful Dodger_It was on the seventh morning after he had left his native place thatOliver limped slowly into the town of Barnet. Tired and hungry he satdown on a doorstep and presently was roused by the question "Hallo mycovey what's the row"The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer was about hisown age but one of the queerest-looking boys that Oliver had ever seen.He was short for his age and dirty and he had about him all the airsand manners of a man. He wore a man's coat which reached nearly to hisheels and he had turned the cuffs back half-way up his arm to get hishands out of the sleeves. Altogether he was as roystering and swaggeringa young gentleman as ever stood four feet six in his bluchers."You want grub" said this strange boy helping Oliver to rise "and youshall have it. I'm at low-watermark myself only one bob and a magpiebut as far as it goes I'll fork out and stump.""Going to London" said the strange boy while they sat and finished ameal in a small public-house."Yes.""Got any lodgings""No.""Money""No."The strange boy whistled."I suppose you want some place to sleep in to-night don't you WellI've got to be in London to-night and I know a 'spectable old genelman
comment489,as lives there wot'll give you lodgings for nothink and never ask forthe change--that is if any genelman he knows interduces you."This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted and onthe way to London where they arrived at nightfall Oliver learnt thathis friend's name was Jack Dawkins but that he was known among hisintimates as "The Artful Dodger."In Field Lane in the slums of Saffron Hill the Dodger pushed open thedoor of a house and drew Oliver within."Now then" cried a voice in reply to his whistle."Plummy and slam" said the Dodger.This seemed to be a watchword for a man at once appeared with a candle."There's two on you" said the man. "Who's the t'other one and wheredoes he come from""A new pal from Greenland" replied Jack Dawkins. "Is Fagin upstairs""Yes he's sortin the wipes. Up with you."The room that Oliver was taken into was black with age and dirt. Severalrough beds made of old sacks were huddled side by side on the floor.Seated round the table were four or five boys none older than theDodger smoking long clay pipes and drinking spirits with the air ofmiddle-aged men. An old shrivelled Jew of repulsive face was standingover the fire dividing his attention between a frying-pan and aclothes-horse full of silk handkerchiefs.The Dodger whispered a few words to the Jew and then said aloud "Thisis him Fagin my friend Oliver Twist."The Jew grinned. "We are very glad to see you Oliver--very."A good supper Oliver had that night and a heavy sleep and a heartybreakfast next morning.When the breakfast was cleared away Fagin who was quite a merry oldgentleman and the Dodger and another boy named Charley Bates played ata very curious game. The merry old gentleman placing a snuffbox in onepocket of his trousers a note-book in the other and a watch in hiswaistcoat and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt andspectacle-case and handkerchief in his coat-pocket trotted up and downthe room in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk aboutthe streets while the Dodger and Charley Bates had to get all thesethings out of his pockets without being observed. It was so very funnythat Oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face.A few days later and he understood the full meaning of the game.The Dodger and Charley Bates had taken Oliver out for a walk and aftersauntering along they suddenly pulled up short on Clerkenwell Green atthe sight of an old gentleman reading at a bookstall. So intent was heover his book that he might have been sitting in an easy chair in hisstudy.To Oliver's horror the Dodger plunged his hand into the gentleman'spocket drew out a handkerchief and handed it to Bates. Then both boysran away round the corner at full speed. Oliver frightened at what hehad seen ran off too the old gentleman at the same moment missinghis handkerchief and seeing Oliver scudding off concluded he was thethief and gave chase still holding his book in his hand.The cry of "Stop thief" was raised. Oliver was knocked down capturedand taken to the police-station by a constable.The magistrate was still sitting and Oliver would have been convictedthere and then but for the arrival of the bookseller."Stop stop Don't take him away I saw it all I keep the bookstall"cried the man. "I saw three boys two others and the prisoner here. Therobbery was committed by another boy. I saw that this one was amazed byit."Oliver was acquitted. But he had fainted. Mr. Brownlow for that was thename of the old gentleman shocked and moved at the boy's deathlywhiteness straightway carried the boy off in a cab to his own house in
comment490,a quiet shady street near Pentonville._III.--Back in Fagin's Den_For many days Oliver remained insensible to the goodness of his newfriends. But all that careful nursing could do was done and he slowlyand surely recovered. Mr. Brownlow a kind-hearted old bachelor tookthe greatest interest in his _protg_ and Oliver implored him not toturn him out of doors to wander in the streets."My dear child" said the old gentleman moved by the warmth of Oliver'sappeal "you need not be afraid of my deserting you. I have beendeceived before in people I have endeavored to benefit but I feelstrongly disposed to trust you nevertheless and I am more interestedin your behalf than I can well account for. Let me hear your storyspeak the truth to me and you shall not be friendless while I amalive."A certain unmistakable likeness in Oliver to a lady's portrait that wason the wall of the room struck Mr. Brownlow. What connection could therebe between the original of the portrait and this poor childBut before Mr. Brownlow had heard Oliver's story he had lost the boy.For Fagin horribly uneasy lest Oliver should be the means of betrayinghis late companions resolved to get him back as quickly as possible. Toaccomplish his evil purpose Nancy a young woman who belonged toFagin's gang and who had seen Oliver was prevailed upon to undertakethe commission.Now the very evening before Oliver was to tell his story to Mr.Brownlow the boy anxious to prove his honesty had set out with somebooks on an errand to the bookseller at Clerkenwell Green."You are to say" said Mr. Brownlow "that you have brought these booksback and that you have come to pay the four pound ten I owe him. Thisis a five-pound note so you will have to bring me back ten shillingschange.""I won't be ten minutes sir" replied Oliver eagerly.He was walking briskly along thinking how happy and contented he oughtto feel when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud"Oh my dear brother" He had hardly looked up when he was stopped byhaving a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck."Don't" cried Oliver struggling. "Let go of me. Who is it What areyou stopping me for"The only reply to this was a great number of loud lamentations from theyoung woman who had embraced him."I've found him Oh Oliver Oliver Oh you naughty boy to make mesuffer such distress on your account Come home dear come. Oh I'vefound him Thank gracious goodness heavens I've found him"The young woman burst out crying and a couple of women standing byasked what was the matter."Oh ma'am" replied the young woman "he ran away from his parents andwent and joined a set of thieves and bad characters and almost brokehis mother's heart.""Young wretch" said one woman."Go home do you little brute" said the other."I'm not" replied Oliver greatly alarmed. "I don't know her. I haven'tany sister or father or mother. I'm an orphan I live at Pentonville.""Oh only hear him how he braves it out" cried the young woman. "Makehim come home or he'll kill his dear mother and father and break myheart""What the devil's this" said a man bursting out of a beer-shop with awhite dog at his heels. "Young Oliver Come home to your poor mother
comment491,you young dog""I don't belong to them. I don't know them Help help" cried Oliverstruggling in the man's powerful grasp."Help" repeated the man. "Yes I'll help you you young rascal Whatbooks are these You've been a-stealin' 'em have you Give 'em here"With these words the man tore the volumes from his grasp and struck himon the head.Weak with recent illness stupefied by the blows and the suddenness ofthe attack terrified by the brutality of the man--who was none otherthan Bill Sikes the roughest of all Fagin's pupils--what could one poorchild do Darkness had set in it was a low neighbourhood resistancewas useless. Sikes and Nancy hurried the boy on between them throughcourts and alleys till once more he was within the dreadful housewhere the Dodger had first brought him. Long after the gas-lamps werelighted Mr. Brownlow sat waiting in his parlour. The servant had run upthe street twenty times to see if there were any traces of Oliver. Thehousekeeper had waited anxiously at the open door. But no Oliverreturned._IV.--Oliver Falls among Friends_Mr. Bill Sikes having an important house-breaking engagement with hisfellow-robber Mr. Toby Crackit at Shepperton decided that Oliver mustaccompany him.It was a detached house and the night was dark as pitch when Sikes andCrackit dragging Oliver along climbed the wall and approached anarrow shuttered window. In vain Oliver implored them to let him go."Listen you young limb" whispered Sikes when a crowbar had overcomethe shutter and the lattice had been opened. "I'm going to put youthrough there." Drawing a dark lantern from his pocket he added "Takethis light go softly up the steps straight afore you and along thehall to the street door unfasten it and let us in."The boy was put through the window and Sikes pointing to the door withhis pistol told him if he faltered he would shoot him.Hardly had Oliver advanced a few yards before Sikes called out "Backback"Startled the boy dropped the lantern uncertain whether to advance orfly.The cry was repeated--a light appeared--a vision of two terrifiedhalf-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes--aflash--a loud noise--and he staggered back.Sikes got him out of the window before the smoke cleared away and firedhis pistol after the men who were already in retreat."Clasp your arm tighter" said Sikes. "Give me a shawl here. They've hithim. Quick The boy is bleeding."Then came the loud ringing of a bell and the shouts of men and thesensation of being carried over uneven ground at a rapid pace. And thenthe noises grew confused in the distance and Oliver saw and heard nomore.Sikes finding the chase too hot was compelled to leave Oliver in aditch and make his escape with his friend Crackit.It was morning when Oliver awoke. His left arm was rudely bandaged in ashawl and the bandage was saturated with blood. Weak and dizzy he yetfelt that if he remained where he was he would surely die and so hestaggered to his feet. The only house in sight was the one he hadentered a few hours earlier and he bent his steps towards it. He pushedagainst the garden-gate--it was unlocked. He tottered across the lawnclimbed the steps knocked faintly at the door and his whole strengthfailing him sank down against the little portico.Mr. Giles the butler and general steward of the house who had firedthe shot and led the pursuit was just explaining the exciting events ofthe night to his fellow-servants of the kitchen when Oliver's knock washeard. With considerable reluctance the door was opened and then thegroup peeping timorously over each other's shoulders beheld no moreformidable object than poor little Oliver Twist speechless andexhausted."Here he is" bawled Giles. "Here's one of the thieves ma'am Woundedmiss I shot him"They lugged the fainting boy into the hall and then in the midst of all
comment492,the noise and commotion there was heard a sweet and gentle voice whichquelled it in an instant."Giles" whispered the voice from the stairhead. "Hush You frighten myaunt as much as the thieves did. Is the poor creature much hurt""Wounded desperate miss" replied Giles.After a hasty consultation with her aunt the same gentle speaker badethem carry the wounded person upstairs and send to Chertsey at allspeed for a constable and a doctor. The latter arrived when the younglady and her aunt Mrs. Maylie were at breakfast and his visit to thesick-room changed the state of affairs. On his return he begged Mrs.Maylie and her niece to accompany him upstairs.In lieu of the dogged black-visaged ruffian they had expected to seethere lay a mere child sunk in a deep sleep.The ladies could not believe this delicate boy was a criminal and whenon waking up he told them his simple history they were determined toprevent his arrest.The doctor undertook to save the boy and to that end entered thekitchen where Mr. Giles Brittles his assistant and the constable wereregaling themselves with ale."How is the patient sir" asked Giles."So-so" returned the doctor. "I'm afraid you've got yourself into ascrape there Mr. Giles. Are you a Protestant And what are _you_"turning sharply on Brittles."Yes sir I hope so" faltered Mr. Giles turning very pale for thedoctor spoke with strange severity."I'm the same as Mr. Giles sir" said Brittles starting violently."Then tell me this both of you" said the doctor. "Are you going totake upon yourselves to swear that that boy upstairs is the boy that wasput through the little window last night Come out with it Payattention to the reply constable. Here's a house broken into and acouple of men catch a moment's glimpse of a boy in the midst ofgunpowder-smoke and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness.Here's a boy comes to that very same house next morning and because hehappens to have his arm tied up these men lay violent hands upon himplace his life in danger and swear he is the thief. I ask you again"thundered the doctor "are you on your solemn oaths able to identifythat boy"Of course under these circumstances as Mr. Giles and Brittles couldn'tidentify the boy the constable retired and the attempted robbery was
comment493,followed by no arrests.Oliver Twist grew up in the peaceful and happy home of Mrs. Maylieunder the tender affection of two good women. Later on Mr. Brownlow wasfound and Oliver's character restored. It was proved too that theportrait Mr. Brownlow possessed was that of Oliver's mother whom itsowner had once esteemed dearly. Betrayed by fate the unhappy woman hadsought refuge in the workhouse only to die in giving birth to her son.In that same workhouse where his authority had formerly been soconsiderable Mr. Bumble came--as a pauper--to die.Tragic was the fate of poor Nancy. Suspected by Fagin of plottingagainst her accomplices the Jew so worked on Sikes that the savagehousebreaker murdered her.But neither Fagin nor Sikes escaped.For the Jew was taken and condemned to death and in the condemned cellcame the recollection to him of all the men he had known who had diedupon the scaffold some of them through his means.Sikes when the news of Nancy's murder got abroad was hunted by afurious crowd. He had taken refuge in an old disreputable uninhabitedhouse known to his accomplices which stood right over the Thames inJacob's Island not far from Dockhead but the pursuit was hot and theonly chance of safety lay in getting to the river.At the very moment when the crowd was forcing its way into the houseSikes made a running noose to slip beneath his arm-pits and so lowerhimself to a ditch beneath. He was out on the roof and then when theloop was over his head the face of the murdered girl seemed to stare athim."The eyes again" he cried in an unearthly screech and threw up hisarms in horror.Staggering as if struck by lightning he lost his balance and tumbledover the parapet. The noose was on his neck. It ran up with his weighttight as a bowstring. He fell for five-and-thirty feet and then aftera sudden jerk and a terrible convulsion of the limbs swung lifelessagainst the wall.                                   Old Curiosity Shop      "The Old Curiosity Shop" was begun by Dickens in his new     weekly publication called "Master Humphrey's Clock" in 1840     and its early chapters were written in the first person. But     its author soon got rid of the impediments that pertained to     "Master Humphrey" and "when the story was finished" Dickens
comment494,     wrote "I caused the few sheets of 'Master Humphrey's Clock'     which had been printed in connection with it to be     cancelled." "The Old Curiosity Shop" won a host of friends for     the author A.C. Swinburne even declared Little Nell equal to     any character in fiction. The lonely figure of the child with     grotesque and wild but not impossible companions took the     hearts of all readers by storm and the death of Little Nell     moved thousands to tears. While the story was appearing Tom     Hood then unknown to Dickens wrote an essay "tenderly     appreciative" of Little Nell "and of all her shadowy kith and     kin." The immense and deserved popularity of the book is shown     by the universal acquaintance with Mrs. Jarley and the common     use of the phrase "Codlin's the friend--not Short."_I.--Little Nell and Her Grandfather_The shop was one of those receptacles for old and curious things whichseem to crouch in odd corners of London. There were suits of mailstanding like ghosts in armour rusty weapons of various kindstapestry and strange furniture that might have been designed in dreams.The haggard aspect of a little old man with long grey hair who stoodwithin was wonderfully suited to the place. Nothing in the wholecollection looked older or more worn than he.Confronting the old man was a young man of dissipated appearance andhigh words were taking place."I tell you again I want to see my sister" said the younger man. "Youcan't change the relationship you know. If you could you'd have doneit long ago. But as I may have to wait some time I'll call in a friendof mine with your leave."At this he brought in a companion of even more dissolute appearance thanhimself."There it's Dick Swiveller" said the young fellow pushing him in."But is the old min agreeable" said Mr. Swiveller in an undertone."What is the odds so long as the fire of soul is kindled at the taper ofconviviality and the wing of friendship never moults a feather Butonly one little whisper Fred--_is_ the old min friendly"Mr. Swiveller then leaned back in his chair and relapsed into silenceonly to break it by observing "Gentlemen how does the case stand Hereis a jolly old grandfather and here is a wild young grandson. The jollyold grandfather says to the wild young grandson 'I have brought you upand educated you Fred you have bolted a little out of the course andyou shall never have another chance.' The wild young grandson makesanswer 'You're as rich as can be why can't you stand a trifle for yourgrown up relation' Then the plain question is ain't it a pity thisstate of things should continue and how much better it would be for theold gentleman to hand over a reasonable amount of tin and make it allright and comfortable""Why do you persecute me" said the old man turning to his grandson."Why do you bring your profligate companions here I am poor. You havechosen your own path follow it. Leave Nell and me to toil and work.""Nell will be a woman soon" returned the other "She'll forget herbrother unless he shows himself sometimes."The door opened and the child herself appeared followed by an elderlyman so low in stature as to be quite a dwarf though his head and facewere large enough for the body of a giant.Mr. Swiveller turned to the dwarf and stooping down whispered audibly
comment495,in his ear. "The watchword to the old min is--fork.""Is what" demanded Quilp for that--Daniel Quilp--was the dwarf's name."Is fork sir fork" replied Mr. Swiveller slapping his pocket. "Youare awake sir"The dwarf nodded the grandson having announced his intention ofrepeating his visit left the house accompanied by his friend."So much for dear relations" said Quilp with a sour look. He put hishand into his breast and pulled out a bag. "Here I brought it myselfas being in gold it was too large and heavy for Nell to carry. I wouldI knew in what good investment all these supplies are sunk. But you area deep man and keep your secret close.""My secret" said the old man with a haggard look. "Yes you'reright--I keep it close--very close."He said no more but taking the money locked it in an iron safe.That night as on many a night previous Nell's grandfather went outleaving the child in the strange house alone to return in the earlymorning.Quilp to whom the old man had again applied for money learnt of thesenocturnal expeditions and sent no answer but came in person to the oldcuriosity shop.The old man was feverish and excited as he impatiently addressed thedwarf."Have you brought me any money""No" returned Quilp."Then" said the old man clenching his hands "the child and I arelost. No recompense for the time and money lost""Neighbour" said Quilp "you have no secret from me now. I know thatall those sums of money you have had from me have found their way to thegamingtable.""I never played for gain of mine or love of play" cried the old manfiercely. "My winnings would have been bestowed to the last farthing ona young sinless child whose life they would have sweetened and madehappy. But I never won.""Dear me" said Quilp. "The last advance was 70 and it went in onenight. And so it comes to pass that I hold every security you couldscrape together and a bill of sale upon the stock and property."So saying he nodded deaf to all entreaties for further loans and tookhis leave.The house was no longer theirs. Mr. Quilp encamped on the premises andthe goods were sold. A day was fixed for their removal."Grandfather let us begone from this place" said little Nell "let uswander barefoot through the world rather than linger here.""We will" answered the old man. "We will travel afoot through thefields and woods and by the side of rivers and trust ourselves to God.Thou and I together Nell may be cheerful and happy yet and learn toforget this time as if it had never been."_II.--Messrs. Codlin and Short_The sun was setting when little Nell and her grandfather who had beenwandering many days reached the wicket gate of a country churchyard.Two men were seated in easy attitudes on the grass by the church--twomen of the class of itinerant showmen exhibitors of the freaks ofPunch--and they had come there to make needful repairs in the stagearrangements for one was engaged in binding together a small gallowswith thread while the other was fixing a new black wig upon the head ofa puppet."Are you going to show 'em to-night Are you" said the old man."That's the intention governor and unless I'm much mistaken mypartner Tommy Codlin is a-calculating at this minute what we've lostthrough your coming upon us. Cheer up Tommy it can't be much."To this Mr. Codlin replied in a surly grumbling manner "I don't careif we haven't lost a farden but you're too free. If you stood in frontof the curtain and see the public's faces as I do you'd know humannatur' better.""Ah it's been the spoiling of you Tommy your taking to that branch"
comment496,rejoined his companion. "When you played the ghost in the reg'lar dramain the fairs you believed in everything--except ghosts. But now you'rea universal mistruster.""Never mind" said Mr. Codlin with the air of a discontentedphilosopher "I know better now p'r'aps I'm sorry for it. Look herehere's all this Judy's clothes falling to pieces again."The child seeing they were at a loss for a needle and thread timidlyproposed to mend it for them and even Mr. Codlin had nothing to urgeagainst a proposal so reasonable."If you're wanting a place to stop at" said Short "I should advise youto take up at the same house with us. That's it the long low whitehouse there. It's very cheap."The public-house was kept by a fat old landlord and landlady who madeno objection to receiving their new guests but praised Nelly's beautyand were at once prepossessed in her behalf."We're going on to the races" said Short next morning to thetravellers. "If that's your way and you'd like to have us for companylet us go together. If you prefer going alone only say the word and weshan't trouble you.""We'll go with you" said the old man. "Nell--with them with them."They stopped that night at an ancient roadside inn called the JollySandboys and supper being in preparation Nelly and her grandfather hadnot long taken their seats by the kitchen fire before they fell asleep."Who are they" whispered the landlord."No-good I suppose" said Mr. Codlin."They're no harm" said Short "depend upon that. It's very plainbesides that they're not used to this way of life. Don't tell me thathandsome child has been in the habit of prowling about as she's donethese last two or three days. I know better. The old man ain't in hisright mind. Haven't you noticed how anxious he is always to geton--furder away--furder away Mind what I say he has given his friendsthe slip and persuaded this delicate young creatur all along of herfondness for him to be his guide--where to he knows no more than theman in the moon. I'm not a-going to stand that""You're not a-going to stand that" cried Mr. Codlin glancing at theclock and counting the minutes to supper time."I" repeated Short emphatically and slowly "am not a-going to standit. I am not a-going to see this fair young child a-falling into bad
comment497,hands. Therefore when they develop an intention of parting company fromus I shall take measures for detaining of 'em and restoring 'em totheir friends who I dare say have had their disconsolation pasted upon every wall in London by this time.""Short" said Mr. Codlin looking up with eager eyes "it's possiblethere may be uncommon good sense in what you've said. If there should bea reward Short remember that we're partners in everything"Before Nell retired to rest in her poor garret she was a little startledby the appearance of Mr. Thomas Codlin at her door."Nothing's the matter my dear only I'm your friend. Perhaps youhaven't thought so but it's me that's your friend--not him. I'm thereal open-hearted man. Short's very well and seems kind but heoverdoes it. Now I don't."The child was puzzled and could not tell what to say."Take my advice as long as you travel with us keep as near me as youcan. Recollect the friend. Codlin's the friend not Short. Short's verywell as far as he goes but the real friend is Codlin--not Short."_III.--Jarley's Waxwork_Codlin and Short stuck so close to Nell and her grandfather that thechild grew frightened especially at the unwonted attentions of Mr.Thomas Codlin. The bustle of the racecourse enabled them to escape andonce more the travellers were alone.It was a few days later when as the afternoon was wearing away theycame upon a caravan drawn up by the roadside. It was a smart littlehouse upon wheels not a gipsy caravan for at the open door sat aChristian lady stout and comfortable taking her tea upon a drumcovered with a white napkin."Hey" cried the lady of the caravan seeing the old man and the childwalking slowly by. "Yes to be sure I saw you there with my own eyesAnd very sorry I was to see you in company with a Punch a lowpractical wulgar wretch that people should scorn to look at.""I was not there by choice" returned the child. "We don't know our wayand the two men were very kind to us and let us travel with them. Doyou know them ma'am""Know 'em child Know _them_ But you're young and inexperienced. Do Ilook as if I knowed 'em Does the caravan look as if _it_ knowed 'em""No ma'am no. I beg your pardon."It was granted immediately. And then the lady of the caravan findingthe travellers were hungry handed them a tea-tray with bread-and-butterand a knuckle of ham and finding they were tired took them into thecaravan which was bound for the nearest town some eight miles off.As the caravan moved slowly along its owner began to talk to Nell andpresently pulled out a large roll of canvas. "There child" she said"read that"Nell read aloud the inscription "Jarley's Waxwork.""That's me" said the lady complacently."I never saw any waxwork ma'am" said Nell. "Is it funnier than Punch""Funnier" said Mrs. Jarley in a shrill voice. "It is not funny at all.It's calm and--what's that word again--critical No--classical that'sit--it's calm and classical."In the course of the journey Mrs. Jarley was so taken with the childthat she proposed to engage her and as Nell would not be separated fromher grandfather he was included in the agreement."What I want your granddaughter for" said Mrs. Jarley "is to point 'emout to the company for she has a way with her that people wouldn'tthink unpleasant. It's not a common offer bear in mind it's Jarley'sWaxwork. The duty's very light and genteel the exhibition takes placein assembly rooms or town halls. There is none of your open-air wagrancyat Jarley's remember. And the price of admission is only sixpence.""We are very much obliged to you ma'am" said Nell speaking for hergrandfather "and thankfully accept your offer."
comment498,"And you'll never be sorry for it" returned Mrs. Jarley. "So as that'sall settled let us have a bit of supper."The next morning the caravan having arrived at the town and thewaxworks having been unpacked in the town hall Mrs. Jarley sat down inan armchair in the centre of the room and began to instruct Nell in herduty."That" said Mrs. Jarley in her exhibition tone "is an unfortunate maidof honour in the time of Queen Elizabeth who died from pricking herfinger in consequence of working on a Sunday. Observe the blood which istrickling from her finger also the gold-eyed needle of the period withwhich she is at work."Nell found in the lady of the caravan a kind and considerate person whohad not only a peculiar relish for being comfortable herself but formaking everybody about her comfortable also.But the child noticed that her grandfather grew more and more listlessand vacant and soon a greater sorrow was to come. The passion forgambling revived in the old man one evening when he and Nell outwalking in the country took passing shelter from a storm in a smallpublic-house. He saw men playing cards and allowed to join them lost.The next night he went off alone and Nell finding him gone followed.Her grandfather was with the card-players near an encampment of gypsiesand to her horror he promised to bring more money.Flight was now the only thing possible before her grandfather shouldsteal. How else could he get the money_IV.--Beyond the Pale_Flight by water For two days they travelled on a barge Nell sittingwith her grandfather in the boat. Rugged and noisy fellows were thebargemen and quite brutal among themselves though civil enough totheir passengers. The barge floated into the wharf to which it belongedand now came flight by land through a strange unfriendly town. Thetravellers were penniless and at nightfall took refuge in a deepdoorway.A man miserably clad and begrimed with smoke found them here andlearning they were homeless promised them shelter by the fire of agreat furnace.A dark and blackened region was this they were in. On every side tallchimneys poured out their plague of smoke and at night the smoke was
comment499,changed to fire and chimneys spurted flame. Struggling vegetationsickened and sank under the hot breath of kiln and furnace. Thepeople--men women and children--wan in their looks and ragged in theirattire tended the engines or scowled half naked from the doorlesshouses.That night Nell and her grandfather lay down with nothing between themand the sky. A penny loaf was all they had had that day and very weakand spent the child felt.With morning she was weaker still and a loathing of food prevented hersharing the loaf bought with their last penny. Still she dragged herweary feet on and only at the very end of the town fell senseless tothe ground.Once in their earlier wanderings they had made friends with a villageschoolmaster and now when all hope seemed gone it was thisschoolmaster who brought the travellers into a peaceful haven. For itwas he who passed along when little Nell fell fainting to the groundand it was he who carried her into a small inn hard by. A day's restbrought some recovery to the child and in the evening she was able tosit up."I have made my fortune since I saw you last" said the schoolmaster. "Ihave been appointed clerk and schoolmaster to a village a long way fromhere at five-and-thirty pounds a year."Then the schoolmaster insisted they must come with him and make thejourney by waggons and that when they reached the village someoccupation should be found by which they could subsist.They agreed to go and when the village was reached the efforts of thegood schoolmaster procured a post for Nell. Someone was wanted to keepthe keys of the church and show it to strangers and the old clergymanyielded to the schoolmaster's petition."But an old church is a dull and gloomy place for one so young as youmy child" said the old clergyman laying his hand upon her head andsmiling sadly "I would rather see her dancing on the green at nightsthan have her sitting in the shadow of our mouldering arches."It was very peaceful in the old church and the village children soongrew to love little Nell. At last Nell and her grandfather were beyond
comment500,the need of flight.But the child's strength was failing and in the winter came her death.Dear gentle patient noble Nell was dead. The traces of her earlycares her sufferings and fatigues were gone. She had died with herarms round her grandfather's neck and "God bless you" on her lips.The old man never realised that she was dead. "She is asleep" he said."She will come to-morrow."And thenceforth every day and all day long he waited at her grave. Andpeople would hear him whisper "Lord let her come to-morrow."The last time was on a genial day in spring. He did not return at theusual hour and they went to seek him and found him lying dead upon thestone.They laid by the side of her whom he had loved so well and in thechurch where they had often lingered hand in hand the child and the oldman slept together.                                   Our Mutual Friend      "Our Mutual Friend" was the last long complete novel Dickens     wrote and like all his books it first appeared in monthly     parts. It was so published in 1864-65. After three numbers had     appeared the author wrote "I have grown hard to satisfy and     write very slowly. Although I have not been wanting in     industry I have been wanting in imagination." In his     "Postscript in Lieu of Preface" the author points out--in     answer to those who had disputed the probability of Harmon's     will--"that there are hundreds of will cases far more     remarkable than that fancied in this book." In this same     postscript Dickens also renewed his attack on Poor Law     administration begun in "Oliver Twist." Though "Our Mutual     Friend" is not one of the greatest or most famous of Dickens's     works for it is somewhat loosely constructed as a story and     shows signs of laboured composition it abounds in scenes of     real Dickensian character and is not without touches of the     genius which had made its author the foremost novelist of his     time and one of the greatest writers of all ages._I.--The Man from Somewhere_It was at a dinner-party that Mortimer Lightwood solicitor at therequest of Lady Tippins told the story of the Man from Somewhere."Upon my life" says Mortimer languidly "I can't fix him with a local
comment501,habitation but he comes from the place the name of which escapes mewhere they make the wine."The man" Mortimer goes on "whose name is Harmon was the only son ofa tremendous old rascal who made his money by dust as a dustcontractor. This venerable parent displeased with his son turns himout of doors. The boy takes flight gets aboard ship turns up on dryland among the Cape wine small proprietor farmer grower--whatever youlike to call it. Venerable parent dies. His will is found. It leaves thelowest of a range of dust mountains with a dwelling-house to an oldservant who is sole executor. And that's all except that the son'sinheritance is made conditional on his marrying a girl at the date ofthe will a child four or five years old who is now a marriageable youngwoman. Advertisement and inquiry discovered the son in the Man fromSomewhere and he is now on his way home after fourteen years' absenceto succeed to a very large fortune and to take a wife."Mortimer being asked what would become of the fortune in the event ofthe marriage condition not being fulfilled replies that by a clause inthe will it would then go to the old servant above-mentioned passingover and excluding the son also that if the son had not been livingthe same old servant would have been sole residuary legatee.It is just when the ladies are retiring that Mortimer receives a notefrom the butler."This really arrives in an extraordinarily opportune manner" saysMortimer after reading the paper presented to him. "This is theconclusion of the story of the identical man. Man's drowned"The dinner being over Mortimer Lightwood and his friend Eugene Wrayburninterviewed the boy who had brought the note and then set out in a cabto the riverside quarter of Wapping.The cab dismissed a little winding through some muddy alleys bringsthen to the bright lamp of a police-station where they find thenight-inspector. He takes a bull's-eye and Mortimer and Eugene followhim to a cool grot at the end of the yard. They quickly come out again."No clue gentlemen" says the inspector "as to how the body came intoriver. Very often no clue. Steward of ship in which gentleman came homepassenger had been round to view and could swear to identity. Likewisecould swear to clothes. Inquest to-morrow and no doubt open verdict."A stranger who had entered the station with Lightwood and Wrayburn
comment502,attracts Mr. Inspector's attention."Turned you faint sir You expected to identify""It's a horrible sight" says the stranger. "No I can't identify.""You missed a friend you know or you missed a foe or you wouldn'thave come here you know. Well then ain't it reasonable to ask whowas it" Thus Mr. Inspector. "At least you won't object to write downyour name and address"The stranger took the pen and wrote down "Mr. Julius HandfordExchequer Coffee House Palace Yard Westminster."At the coroner's inquest next day Mr. Mortimer Lightwood watched theproceedings on behalf of the representatives of the deceased and Mr.Julius Handford having given his right address had no summons toappear.Upon the evidence before them the jury found that Mr. John Harmon hadcome by his death under suspicious circumstances though by whose actthere was no evidence to show. Within eight-and-forty hours a reward ofone hundred pounds was proclaimed by the Home Office and for a timepublic interest in the Harmon Murder as it came to be called ran high._II.--The Golden Dustman_Mr. Boffin a broad round-shouldered one-sided old fellow in mourningdressed in a pea overcoat and wearing thick leather gaiters and gloveslike a hedger's came ambling towards the street corner where Silas Weggsat at his stall. A few small lots of fruits and sweets and a choicecollection of halfpenny ballads comprised Mr. Wegg's stock andassuredly it was the hardest little stall of all the sterile littlestalls in London."Morning morning" said the old fellow."Good-morning to _you_ sir" said Mr. Wegg.The old fellow paused and then startled Mr. Wegg with the question"How did you get your wooden leg""In an accident.""Do you like it""Well I haven't got to keep it warm" Mr. Wegg answered desperately."Did you ever hear of the name of Boffin And do you like it""Why no" said Mr. Wegg growing restive "I can't say that I do.""My name's Boffin" said the old fellow smiling. "But there's anotherchance for you. Do you like the name of Nicodemus Think it over. Nickor Noddy. Noddy Boffin that's my name.""It is not sir" said Mr. Wegg in a tone of resignation "a name as Icould wish anyone to call _me_ by but there may be persons that wouldnot view it with the same objections. Silas Wegg is my name. I don'tknow why Silas and I don't know why Wegg.""Now Wegg" said Mr. Boffin "I came by here one morning and heard youreading through your ballads to a butcher-boy. I thought to myself'Here's a literary man _with_ a wooden leg and all print is open tohim And here am I without a wooden leg and all print is shut to me.'""I believe you couldn't show me the piece of English print that Iwouldn't be equal to collaring and throwing" Mr. Wegg admitted
comment503,modestly."Now I want some reading and I must pay a man so much an hour to comeand do it for me. Say two hours a night at twopence-halfpenny. Half-a-crown a week. What do you think of the terms Wegg""Mr. Boffin I never did 'aggle and I never will 'aggle. I meet you atonce free and fair with----Done for double the money"From that night Silas Wegg came to read at Boffin's Bower--or HarmonyJail as the house was formerly called--and he soon learnt that hisemployer was no other than the inheritor of old Harmon's property andthat he was known as the Golden Dustman.It was not long after Silas Wegg's appointment that Mr. Boffin wasaccosted by a strange gentleman who gave his name as John Rokesmithand proposed his services as private secretary. Mr. Rokesmith mentionedthat he lodged at one Mr. Wilfer's in Holloway. Mr. Boffin stared."Father of Miss Bella Wilfer""My landlord has a daughter named Bella.""Well to tell you the truth I don't know what to say" said Mr.Boffin "but call at the Bower though I don't know that I shall ever bein want of a secretary."So to the Bower came Mr. John Rokesmith but not before the Boffins hadcalled at the Wilfers' and seen the young lady destined by old Harmonfor his son's bride."Noddy" said Mrs. Boffin "I have been thinking early and late of thatgirl Bella Wilfer who was so cruelly disappointed both of her husbandand his riches. Don't you think we might do something for her Have herto live with us And Noddy I tell you what I want--I want society. Wehave come into a great fortune and we must act up to it. It's neverbeen acted up to and consequently no good has come of it."It was agreed that they should move into a good house in a goodneighbourhood and that a visit should be paid to Mr. Wilfer at once.Mrs. Wilfer received them with a tragic air."Mrs. Boffin and me ma'am" said Mr. Boffin "are plain people and wemake this call to say we shall be glad to have the honour and pleasureof your daughter's acquaintance and that we shall be rejoiced if yourdaughter will come to consider our house in the light of her homeequally with this.""I am much obliged to you--I am sure" said Miss Bella coldly shakingher curls "but I doubt if I have the inclination to go out at all.""Bella" Mrs. Wilfer admonished her solemnly "you must conquer this""Yes do what your ma says and conquer it my dear" urged Mrs. Boffin"because we shall be so glad to have you and because you are much toopretty to keep yourself shut up."With that Mrs. Boffin gave her a kiss which Bella frankly returned andit was settled that Bella should be sent for as soon as they were ready
comment504,to receive her."By the bye ma'am" said Mr. Boffin as he was leaving "you have alodger""A gentleman" Mrs. Wilfer answered "undoubtedly occupies our firstfloor.""I may call him our mutual friend" said Mr. Boffin. "What sort offellow _is_ our mutual friend now Do you like him""Mr. Rokesmith is very punctual very quiet--a very eligible inmate."The Boffins drove away and Mr. Rokesmith coming to the Bowerextricated Mr. Boffin from a mass of disordered papers and gave suchsatisfaction that his services were accepted and he took up thesecretaryship._II.--The Golden Dustman Deteriorates_Miss Bella Wilfer was conscious that she was growing mercenary. Sheadmitted as much to her father. There were several other secrets she hadto impart beyond her own lack of improvement."Mr. Rokesmith has made an offer to me pa and I told him I thought ita betrayal of trust on his part and an affront to me. Mrs. Boffin hasherself told me with her own kind lips that they wish to see me wellmarried and that when I marry with their consent they will portion memost handsomely. That is another secret. And now there is only one moreand it is very hard to tell it. But Mr. Boffin is being spoilt byprosperity and is changing for the worse every day. Not to me--he isalways the same to me--but to others about him. He grows suspicioushard and unjust. If ever a good man were ruined by good fortune it ismy benefactor."Bella parted from her father and returned to the Boffins to find freshproofs of the deterioration of the Golden Dustman."Now Rokesmith" Mr. Boffin was saying "it's time to settle about yourwages. A man of property like me is bound to consider the market price.If I pay for a sheep I buy it out and out. Similarly if I pay for asecretary I buy _him_ out and out. It's convenient to have you at alltimes ready on the premises."The secretary bowed and withdrew. Bella's eyes followed him to the door.She felt that Mrs. Boffin was uncomfortable."Noddy" said Mrs. Boffin thoughtfully "haven't you been a littlestrict with Mr. Rokesmith to-night Haven't you been just a little notquite like your own old self""Why old woman I hope so" said Mr. Boffin cheerfully. "Our old selveswouldn't do here old lady. Our old selves would be fit for nothing butto be imposed upon. Our old selves weren't people of fortune. Our newselves are. It's a great difference."Very uncomfortable was Bella that night and very uneasy was she as thedays went by for Mr. Boffin made a point of hunting up old books thatgave the lives of misers and the more enjoyment he seemed to get out ofthis literature the harder he became to the secretary. Somehow theworse Mr. Boffin treated his secretary the more Bella felt drawn to theman whose offer of marriage she had refused. The crisis came one morningwhen the Golden Dustman's bearing towards Rokesmith was even morearrogant and offensive than it had been before. Mrs. Boffin was seatedon a sofa and Mr. Boffin had Bella on his arm."Don't be alarmed my dear" he said gently. "I'm going to see yourighted."Then he turned to his secretary."Now sir look at this young lady. How dare you come out of yourstation to pester this young lady with your impudent addresses Thisyoung lady who was far above _you_. This young lady was looking aboutfor money and you had no money."Bella hung her head and Mrs. Boffin broke out crying."This Rokesmith is a needy young man" Mr. Boffin went on unmoved. "Hegets acquainted with my affairs and gets to know that I mean to settle asum of money upon this young lady.""I indignantly deny it" said the secretary quietly. "But our connectionbeing at an end it matters little what I say.""I discharge you" Mr. Boffin retorted. "There's your money."
comment505,"Mrs. Boffin" said Rokesmith "for your unvarying kindness I thank youwith the warmest gratitude. Miss Wilfer good-bye.""Oh Mr. Rokesmith" said Bella in her tears "hear one word from mebefore you go. I am deeply sorry for the reproaches you have borne on myaccount. Out of the depths of my heart I beg your pardon."She gave him her hand and he put it to his lips and said "God blessyou""There was a time when I deserved to be 'righted' as Mr. Boffin hasdone" Bella went on "but I hope that I shall never deserve it again."Once more John Rokesmith put her hand to his lips and then relinquishedit and left the room.Bella threw her arms round Mrs. Boffin's neck. "He has been mostshamefully abused and driven away and I am the cause of it. I must gohome I am very grateful for all you have done for me but I can't stayhere.""Now Bella" said Mr. Boffin "look before you leap. Go away and youcan never come back. And you mustn't expect that I'm a-going to settlemoney on you if you leave me like this because I'm not. Not one brassfarthing.""No power on earth could make me take it now" said Bella haughtily.Then she broke into sobs over saying good-bye to Mrs. Boffin said alast word to Mr. Boffin and ran upstairs. A few minutes later she wentout of the house."That was well done" said Bella when she was in the street "and nowI'll go and see my dear darling pa in the city."_IV.--The Runaway Marriage_Bella found her way to her father's office in the city. It was afterhours and the little man was alone having tea on a small cottage loafand a pennyworth of milk for R. Wilfer was but a clerk on a smallincome. He immediately fetched another loaf and another pennyworth ofmilk and then before she could tell him she had left the Boffins whoshould come along but John Rokesmith. And John Rokesmith not only camein but he caught Bella in his arms and she was content to leave herhead on his breast as if that were her head's chosen and lasting restingplace."I knew you would come to him and I followed you" said Rokesmith. "You_are_ mine.""Yes I am yours if you think me worth taking" Bella responded.Then Bella's father had to hear what had happened and said his daughterhad done well."To think" said Wilfer looking round the office "that anything of atender nature should come off here is what tickles me."A few weeks later and Bella and her father went out early one morningand took the steamer to Greenwich. And at Greenwich there was JohnRokesmith and presently in a church John and Bella were joined together
comment506,in wedlock.They had been married a year and lived in a little house at Blackheath.John Rokesmith went up to the city every day and explained that he was"in a China house." From time to time he would ask her "Would you liketo be rich _now_ my darling" and got for answer "Dear John am I notrich"But for all that a change came in their affairs. For Mortimer Lightwoodwho had met Bella at the Boffins' seeing her walking with her husbandrecognised him as Julius Handford and as Mr. Inspector had neverdiscovered what became of Mr. Julius Handford he must needs pay Mr.Rokesmith a visit. And then it turned out that John Rokesmith was notonly Julius Handford but John Harmon himself much to Mr. Inspector'sastonishment.More surprises were to follow for when John came home next day he toldBella that he had left the China house and was better off."We must have our headquarters in London now my dear and there's ahouse ready for us."And the house which John and Bella visited next day was none other thanthe Boffins' and when they arrived there were Mr. and Mrs. Boffinbeaming at them. Mrs. Boffin told Bella that John Rokesmith was JohnHarmon and how remembering him as a small boy she had guessed itquite early. Then Mrs. Boffin admitted that John despairing of winningBella's heart and determined that there should be no question of moneyin the marriage he was for going away and that Noddy said he wouldprove that she loved him. "We was all of us in it my beauty" Mrs.Boffin concluded "and when you was married there was we hid up in thechurch organ by this husband of yours for he wouldn't let us out withit then as was first meant. But it was Noddy who said that he wouldprove you had a true heart of gold. 'If she was to stand up for you whenyou was slighted' he said to John 'and if she was to do that againsther own interest how would that do' 'Do' says John 'it would raiseme to the skies.' 'Then' says my Noddy 'get ready for the ascentJohn for up you go. Look out for being slighted and oppressed.' Andthen he began. And how he did begin didn't he""It looks as if old Harmon's spirit had found rest at last and as ifhis money had turned bright again after a long rust in the dark" saidMrs. Boffin to her husband that night."Yes old lady."The mystery of the Harmon murder is yet to be explained. John Harmongoing on shore with a fellow passenger who greatly resembled him wasdrugged and robbed of his money in a house near the river by this man.But the robber who had taken Harmon's clothes was himself robbed andthrown into the water and Harmon recovered consciousness and made hisescape just at the time when the body of his assailant was recovered. Inthis state of strange excitement he turned up at the police stationand unwilling to reveal his identity at the moment passed himself offas Julius Handford.                                   Pickwick Papers      Dickens first became known to the public through the famous     "Sketches by Boz" which appeared in the "Monthly Magazine" in     December 1833 the complete series being collected and     published in volume form three years later. This was followed     by the immortal "Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club" in     1836 which soon placed Dickens in the front rank of English     novelists. Frankly humorous as "Pickwick" is Dickens in a     preface to a later edition recorded with satisfaction that     "legal reforms had pared the claws of Messrs. Dodson and     Fogg" that the laws relating to imprisonment for debt had     been altered and the Fleet Prison pulled down._I.--Mr. Pickwick Engages Sam Weller_Mr. Pickwick's apartments in Goswell Street were of a very neat andcomfortable description peculiarly adapted for a man of his genius andobservation and importance as General Chairman of the world-famedPickwick Club.His landlady Mrs. Bardell was a comely woman of bustling manners andagreeable appearance with a natural gift for cooking. Cleanliness andquiet reigned throughout the house and in it Mr. Pickwick's will waslaw.To anyone acquainted with these things and with Mr. Pickwick's admirably
comment507,regulated mind his conduct on the morning previous to his setting outfor Eatanswill seemed most mysterious and unaccountable. He paced theroom popped his head out of the window and constantly referred to hiswatch. It was evident to Mrs. Bardell who was dusting the apartmentthat something of importance was in contemplation."Mrs. Bardell" said Mr. Pickwick at last "your little boy is a verylong time gone.""Why it's a good long way to the Borough sir" remonstrated Mrs.Bardell."Very true so it is. Mrs. Bardell do you think it's a much greaterexpense to keep two people than to keep one""La Mr. Pickwick" said Mrs. Bardell colouring as she fancied sheobserved a species of matrimonial twinkle in the eyes of her lodger."La Mr. Pickwick what a question""Well but _do_ you" inquired Mr. Pickwick."That depends" said Mrs. Bardell "a good deal upon the person youknow Mr. Pickwick and whether it's a saving and careful person sir.""That's very true" said Mr. Pickwick "but the person I have in my eyehere he looked very hard at Mrs. Bardell I think possesses thesequalities. To tell you the truth I have made up my mind. You'll thinkit very strange now that I never consulted you about this matter till Isent your little boy out this morning eh"Mrs. Bardell had long worshipped Mr. Pickwick at a distance and now shethought he was going to propose. A deliberate plan too--sent her littleboy to the Borough to get him out of the way How thoughtful Howconsiderate"It'll save you a good deal of trouble won't it" said Mr. Pickwick."And when I am in town you'll always have somebody to sit with you." Mr.Pickwick smiled placidly."I'm sure I ought to be a very happy woman" said Mrs. Bardelltrembling with agitation. "Oh you kind good playful dear" Andwithout more ado she flung her arms round Mr. Pickwick's neck."Bless my soul" cried the astonished Mr. Pickwick. "Mrs. Bardell mygood woman Dear me what a situation Pray consider if anybody shouldcome""Oh let them come" exclaimed Mrs. Bardell frantically. "I'll neverleave you dear kind soul" And she clung the tighter."Mercy upon me" said Mr. Pickwick struggling "I hear somebody comingupstairs Don't there's a good creature don't" But Mrs. Bardell hadfainted in his arms and before he could gain time to deposit her on achair Master Bardell entered the room followed by Mr. Pickwick'sfriends Mr. Tupman Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass."What is the matter" said the three Pickwickians."I don't know" replied Mr. Pickwick while the ever gallant Mr. Tupmanled Mrs. Bardell who said she was better downstairs. "I cannotconceive what has been the matter with the woman. I merely told her ofmy intention of keeping a manservant when she fell into anextraordinary paroxysm. Very remarkable thing.""Very" said his three friends."There's a man in the passage now" said Mr. Tupman."It's the man I've sent for from the Borough" said Mr. Pickwick. "Havethe goodness to call him up."Mr. Samuel Weller forthwith presented himself having previouslydeposited his old white hat on the landing outside."Ta'nt a wery good 'un to look at" said Sam "but it's an astonishin''un to wear. And afore the brim went it was a wery handsome tile.""Now with regard to the matter on which I sent for you" said Mr.Pickwick."That's the pint sir out vith it as the father said to the child venhe swallowed a farden.""We want to know in the first place" said Mr. Pickwick "whether youare discontented with your present situation"
comment508,"Afore I answers that 'ere question" replied Mr. Weller "_I_ shouldlike to know whether you're a-goin' to purwide me vith a better."Mr. Pickwick smiled benevolently as he said "I have half made up mymind to engage you myself.""Have you though" said Sam. "Wages""Twelve pounds a year.""Clothes""Two suits.""Work""To attend upon me and travel about with me and these gentlemen here.""Take the bill down" said Sam emphatically. "I'm let to a singlegentleman and the terms is agreed upon. If the clothes fit me half aswell as the place they'll do."_II.--Bardell vs. Pickwick_Acting on the advice of Messrs. Dodson  Fogg solicitors Mrs. Bardellbrought an action for breach of promise of marriage against Mr.Pickwick and the damages were laid at 1500. February 14 was the dayfixed for the memorable trial.When Mr. Pickwick and his friends reached the court and the judge--Mr.Justice Stareleigh--had taken his place it was found that only ten ofthe special jury were present and a greengrocer and a chemist werecaught from the common jury to make up the number."I beg this court's pardon" said the chemist "but I hope this courtwill excuse my attendance. I have no assistant and I can't afford tohire one.""Then you ought to be able to afford it" said the judge a mostparticularly short man and so fat that he seemed all face andwaistcoat."Very well my lord" replied the chemist "then there'll be murderbefore this trial's over that's all. I've left nobody but an errand-boy in my shop and I know that he thinks Epsom salts means oxalic acidand syrup of senna laudanum that's all my lord."Mr. Pickwick was regarding the chemist with feelings of the deepesthorror when Mrs. Bardell supported by her friend Mrs. Cluppins wasled into court.Then Sergeant Buzfuz opened the case for the plaintiff and when he hadfinished Elizabeth Cluppins was called."Do you recollect Mrs. Cluppins" said Sergeant Buzfuz "do yourecollect being in Mrs. Bardell's back room on one particular morninglast July when she was dusting Pickwick's apartment""Yes my lord and jury I do" replied Mrs. Cluppins."What were you doing in the back room ma'am" inquired the littlejudge."My lord and jury" said Mrs. Cluppins "I will not deceive you.""You had better not ma'am" said the little judge."I was there" resumed Mrs. Cluppins "unbeknown to Mrs. Bardell I hadbeen out with a little basket gentlemen to buy three pounds of redkidney pertaties which was tuppence ha'penny when I see Mrs. Bardell'sstreet-door on the jar.""On the what" exclaimed the little judge."Partly open my lord.""She _said_ on the jar" said the little judge with a cunning look."I walked in gentlemen just to say good mornin' and went in apermiscuous manner upstairs and into the back room. There was a soundof voices in the front room very loud and forced themselves upon myear."Mrs. Cluppins then related the conversation we have already heardbetween Mr. Pickwick and Mrs. Bardell.The next witness was Mr. Winkle and after him came Mr. Tupman and Mr.Snodgrass all of whom appeared on subpoena by the plaintiff's lawyers.Sergeant Buzfuz then rose and said with considerable importance "CallSamuel Weller."It was quite unnecessary to call him for Samuel Weller stepped briskly
comment509,into the box the instant his name was pronounced."What's your name sir" inquired the judge."Sam Weller my lord.""Do you spell it with a 'V or a 'W" inquired the judge."That depends upon the taste and fancy of the speller my lord" repliedSam "but I spells it with a 'V.'"Here a voice in the gallery exclaimed aloud "Quite right too Samuelquite right. Put it down a we my lord put it down a we.""Who is that that dares to address the court" said the little judgelooking up."I rayther suspect it was my father my lord" replied Sam."Do you see him here now" said the judge."No I don't my lord" replied Sam staring right up in the roof of thecourt."If you could have pointed him out I would have committed himinstantly" said the judge.Sam bowed his acknowledgments."Now Mr. Weller" said Sergeant Buzfuz "I believe you are in theservice of Mr. Pickwick speak up if you please.""I mean to speak up sir" replied Sam. "I am in the service o' that'ere gen'l'man and a wery good service it is.""Little to do and plenty to get I suppose" said Sergeant Buzfuz."Oh quite enough to get sir as the soldier said ven they ordered himthree hundred and fifty lashes" replied Sam."You must not tell us what the soldier said" interposed the judge"it's not evidence.""Wery good my lord.""Now Mr. Weller" said Sergeant Buzfuz "do you recollect anythingparticular happening on the morning when you were first engaged by thedefendant""Yes I do sir. I had a reg'lar new fit-out o' clothes that mornin'and that was a wery partickler and uncommon circumstance vith me inthose days.""Do you mean to tell me Mr. Weller that you saw nothing of thefainting of the plaintiff in the arms of the defendant""Certainly not I was in the passage till they called me up and thenthe old lady wasn't there.""Have you a pair of eyes Mr. Weller""Yes that's just it" replied Sam. "If they was a pair o' patent doublemillion magnifyin' gas microscopes of hextra power p'raps I might beable to see through a flight o' stairs and a deal door but bein' onlyeyes you see my wision's limited.""Do you remember going up to Mrs. Bardell's house one night lastNovember I suppose you went to have a little talk about this trial ehMr. Weller" said Sergeant Buzfuz looking knowingly at the jury."I went up to pay the rent" said Sam "but the ladies gets into a werygreat state of admiration at the honourable conduct o' Mr. Dodson andFogg and said what a wery gen'rous thing it was o' them to have takenup the case on spec. and to have charged nothin' at all for costsunless they got 'em out of Mr. Pickwick."At this very unexpected reply the spectators tittered and Mr. SergeantBuzfuz said curtly "Stand down sir."Sergeant Snubbin then addressed the jury on behalf of the defendant andafter that Mr. Justice Stareleigh summed up.At the end of a quarter of an hour the jury brought in a verdict for theplaintiff with 750 damages.In the court-room Mr. Pickwick encountered Messrs. Dodson and Foggrubbing their hands with satisfaction."Not one farthing of costs or damages do you ever get out of me if Ispend the rest of my existence in a debtor's prison" said Mr. Pickwick."We shall see about that" said Mr. Fogg grinning.Outside Mr. Pickwick and his friends made their way to a hackney coachand Sam Weller was just preparing to jump upon the box when his fatherstood before him. The old gentleman shook his head gravely and said inwarning accents "I know'd what 'ud come o' this here mode o' doin'bisness. Oh Sammy Sammy vy worn't there a alleybi"
comment510,"But surely my dear sir" said Perker to his client the followingmorning "you don't really mean seriously now that you won't pay thesecosts and damages""Not one halfpenny" said Mr. Pickwick."Hooroar for the principle as the money-lender said ven he vouldn'trenew the bill" observed Mr. Samuel Weller._III.--In the Fleet Prison_Two months later Mr. Pickwick was arrested for the non-payment of costsand damages and taken to the Fleet Prison. And so for the first time inhis life Mr. Pickwick found himself within the walls of a debtor'sprison."Where am I to sleep to-night" inquired Mr. Pickwick of the turnkeyand after some discussion it was discovered there was a bed to let."It ain't a large 'un but it's an out-and-outer to sleep in. This waysir" said the turnkey.Mr. Pickwick accompanied by Sam Weller followed his guide up astaircase and along a gallery at the end of this was an apartmentcontaining eight or nine iron bedsteads.Mr. Pickwick felt very low-spirited and uncomfortable when he was leftalone and he went slowly to bed. He was awakened from his slumbers bythe noise of his bed-fellows one of whom wearing grey cottonstockings was performing a hornpipe while another evidently verydrunk was warbling as much as he could recollect of a comic song thethird a man with thick bushy whiskers was applauding both performers."My name is Smangle sir" said the man with the whiskers to Mr.Pickwick."Mine is Mivins" said the man in the stockings."Well but come" said Mr. Smangle after assuring Mr. Pickwick a greatmany times that he entertained a very high respect for the feelings of agentleman "this is but dry work. Let's rinse our mouths with a drop ofburnt sherry the last-comer shall stand it Mivins shall fetch it andI'll help to drink it. That's a fair and gentleman-like division oflabour anyhow."Mr. Pickwick unwilling to hazard a quarrel gladly assented to theproposition.When Mr. Pickwick opened his eyes next morning the first object uponwhich they rested was Samuel Weller seated upon a small blackportmanteau.He soon learnt that money was in the Fleet just what money was out ofit and that if he wished it he could have a room to himself if he waswilling to pay for it."There's a capital room up in the coffee-room flight that belongs to aChancery prisoner" said the turnkey. "It'll stand you in a pound aweek. Lord Why didn't you say at first that you was willing to comedown handsome"The matter was soon arranged and in a short time the room wasfurnished."Sam" said Mr. Pickwick when his servant had done his best to make theapartment comfortable and was now inspecting the arrangements "I havefelt from the first that this is not the place to bring a young man to.""Nor an old 'un neither sir.""You're quite right Sam" said Mr. Pickwick. "But old men may come herethrough their own heedlessness and unsuspicion. Do you understand meSam""Vell sir" rejoined Sam after a pause "I think I see your drift andit's my 'pinion that you're a-comin' it a great deal too strong as themail-coachman said to the snowstorm ven it overtook him.""For the time that I remain here" said Mr. Pickwick "you must leaveme Sam.""Now I tell you vot it is" said Mr. Weller in a grave and solemnvoice. "This here sort o' thing won't do at all so don't let's hear nomore about it.""I am serious Sam" said Mr. Pickwick.
comment511,"You air air you sir" inquired Mr. Weller. "Wery good sir. Then soam I."With that Mr. Weller fixed his hat on his head with great precision andleft the room. Having found his father Sam explained to the elder Mr.Weller that Mr. Pickwick must not be left alone in the Fleet."Vy they'll eat him up alive Sammy" exclaimed the elder Mr. Weller."Stop there by himself poor creetur without nobody to take his partIt can't be done Samivel it can't be done""O' course it can't" asserted Sam. "Well then I tell you wot it is.I'll trouble you for the loan of five-and-twenty pound. P'raps you mayask for it five minits artervards p'raps I may say I von't pay and cutup rough. You von't think o' arrestin' your own son for the money andsendin' him off to the Fleet will you you unnat'ral wagabone"The elder Mr. Weller having grasped the idea laughed till he waspurple.In the course of the day Sam was duly arrested at the suit of hisfather and Sam having been formally delivered into the warden'scustody passed at once into the prison and went straight to hismaster's room."I'm a pris'ner sir" said Sam. "I was arrested this here weryarternoon for debt and the man as put me in 'ull never let me out tillyou go yourself.""Bless my heart and soul" ejaculated Mr. Pickwick. "What do you mean""Wot I say sir" rejoined Sam. "If it's forty year to come I shall bea pris'ner and I'm very glad on it. He's a malicious bad-disposedvorldly-minded windictive creetur wot's put me in with a hard heart asthere ain't no soft'nin' as the wirtuous clergyman remarked of the oldgen'l'm'n with a dropsy ven he said that upon the whole he thought he'drather leave his property to his vife than build a chapel with it."In vain Mr. Pickwick remonstrated."I takes my determination on principle sir" remarked Sam "and youtakes yours on the same ground vich puts me in mind o' the man askilled hisself on principle."_IV.--Mr. Pickwick Leaves the Fleet_Those enterprising lawyers Messrs. Dodson and Fogg having obtained nomoney from Mr. Pickwick proceeded in July to arrest Mrs. Bardell whoas a matter of form had given them a _cognovit_ for the amount of theircosts.Mr. Pickwick was taking his evening walk in the grounds of the Fleetwhen Mrs. Bardell was brought in and Sam Weller seeing the lady tookoff his hat in mock reverence. Mr. Pickwick turned indignantly away."Don't bother the woman" said the turnkey to Weller "she's just comein.""A pris'ner" said Sam. "Who's the plaintives What for Speak up oldfeller""Dodson and Fogg" replied the man."Here Job Job" shouted Sam dashing into the passage and calling fora man who went errands for the prisoners. "Run to Mr. Perker's Job Iwant him directly. I see some good in this. Here's a game Hooray"Mr. Perker was in Mr. Pickwick's room betimes next morning."Well now my dear sir" said Perker "the first question I have to ask
comment512,is whether this woman is to remain here It rests solely and wholly andentirely with you.""With me" ejaculated Mr. Pickwick."Nobody but you can rescue her from this den of wretchedness to whichno man and still more no woman should ever be consigned if I had mywill" resumed Mr. Perker. "I have seen the woman this morning. Bypaying the costs you can obtain a full release and discharge from thedamages and further a voluntary statement under her hand that thisbusiness was from the very first fomented and encouraged by these menDodson and Fogg. She entreats me to intercede with you and imploresyour pardon."Before Mr. Pickwick could reply there was a low murmuring of voicesoutside and a hesitating knock at the door and Mr. Winkle Mr. Tupmanand Mr. Snodgrass entering most opportunely at last by their unitedpleadings Mr. Pickwick was fairly argued out of his resolutions. Atthree o'clock that afternoon Mr. Pickwick took a last look at his littleroom and made his way as well as he could through the throng of debtorswho pressed eagerly forward to shake him by the hand until he reachedthe lodge steps. He turned here to look about him and his eyebrightened as he did so. In all the crowd of wan emaciated faces hesaw not one which was not the happier for his sympathy and charity.As for Sam Weller having dispatched Job Trotter to procure his formaldischarge his next proceeding was to invest his whole stock of readymoney in the purchase of five-and-twenty gallons of mild porter whichhe himself dispensed on the racket-ground to everybody who would partakeof it. This done he hurra'd in divers parts of the building until helost his voice and then quietly relapsed into his usual collected andphilosophical condition and followed his master out of the prison.                                   Tale of Two Cities      The French Revolution has been the subject of more books than     any secular event that ever occurred and two books by English     writers have brought the passion the cruelty and the horror     of it for all time within the shuddering comprehension of     English-speaking people. One is a history that is more than a     history the other a tale that is more than a tale. Dickens     no doubt owed much of his inspiration to Carlyle's tremendous     prose epic. But the genius that depicted a moving and tragic     story upon the red background of the Terror was Dickens's own     and the "Tale of Two Cities" was final proof that its author     could handle a great theme in a manner that was worthy of its     greatness. The work was one of the novelist's later     writings--it was published in 1859--and is in many respects     distinct from all his others. It stands by itself among     Dickens's masterpieces in sombre and splendid loneliness--a     detached glory to its author and to his country's literature._I.--Recalled to Life_A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken in the street. All thepeople within reach had suspended their business or their idleness torun to the spot and drink the wine. Some kneeled down made scoops oftheir two hands joined and tried to sip before the wine had all run outbetween their fingers. Others dipped in the puddles with little mugs ofmutilated earthenware or even with handkerchiefs from women's heads. Ashrill sound of laughter resounded in the street while this wine gamelasted.The wine was red wine and had stained the ground of the narrow streetin the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris where it was spilled. It hadstained many hands too and many faces and many naked feet and manywooden shoes. One tall joker so besmirched scrawled upon a wall with
comment513,his finger dipped in muddy wine lees "Blood"And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine which a momentary gleamhad driven from his sacred countenance the darkness of it was heavy--cold dirt sickness ignorance and want were the lords in waiting onthe saintly presence. The children had ancient faces and grave voicesand upon them and upon the grown faces and ploughed into every furrowof age and coming up afresh was the sign--Hunger.The master of the wine-shop outside of which the cask had been brokenturned back to his shop when the struggle for the wine was ended.Monsieur Defarge was a dark bull-necked man good-humoured-looking onthe whole but implacable-looking too. Three men who had been drinkingat the counter paid for their wine and left. An elderly gentleman whohad been sitting in a corner with a young lady advanced introducedhimself as Mr. Jarvis Lorry of Tellson's Bank London and begged thefavour of a word.The conference was very short but very decided. It had not lasted aminute when Monsieur Defarge nodded and went out followed by Mr. Lorryand the young lady.He led them through a stinking little black courtyard and up astaircase to a dim garret where a white-haired man sat on a low benchstooping and very busy making shoes."You are still hard at work I see" said Monsieur Defarge.A pair of haggard eyes looked at the questioner and a very faint voicereplied "Yes I am working.""Here is a visitor. Show him that shoe and tell him the maker's name."There was a long pause and the shoemaker asked "What did you say"Defarge repeated his words."It is a lady's shoe" answered the shoemaker."And the maker's name""One Hundred and Five North Tower.""Dr. Manette" said Mr. Lorry looking steadfastly at him "do youremember nothing of me Do you remember nothing of Defarge--your oldservant"As the Bastille captive of many years gazed at them marks ofintelligence forced themselves through the mist that had fallen on him.They were fainter they were gone but they had been there. The younglady moved forward with tears streaming from her eyes and kissed him.He took up her golden hair and looked at it then drew from his breasta folded rag and opened it carefully. It contained a little quantity ofhair. He took the girl's hair into his hand again."It is the same How can it be She had a fear of my going that night._Was it you_" He turned upon her with frightful suddenness. But hisvigour swiftly died out and he gloomily shook his head. "No no no Itcan't be"She fell on her knees and clasped his neck."If you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that was once sweetmusic to your ears weep for it--weep for it Thank God" she cried. "Ifeel his sacred tears upon my face Leave us here" she said. And asthe darkness closed in they left father and daughter together.They came back at night. A coach stood outside the courtyard and thelately released prisoner in scared blank wonder began the journeythat was to end in England and rest._II.--The Jackal_In the dimly-lighted passages of the Old Bailey Dr. Manette hisdaughter and Mr. Lorry stood by Mr. Charles Darnay--just acquitted on acharge of high treason--congratulating him on his escape from death.It was not difficult to recognise in Dr. Manette intellectual of faceand upright in bearing the shoemaker of the garret in Paris. He and hisdaughter had been unwilling witnesses for the prosecution called togive evidence that might be distorted into corroboration of a paid spy'sfalsehoods as to Darnay's dealings with the French king.Darnay kissed Lucie Manette's hand fervently and gratefully and warmlythanked his counsel Mr. Stryver. As he watched them go a person whohad been leaning against the wall stepped up to him. It was Mr. Cartona barrister who had sat throughout the trial with his whole attentionseemingly concentrated upon the ceiling of the court. Everybody had beenstruck with the extraordinary resemblance cleverly used by thedefending counsel to confound a witness between Mr. Carton and Mr.
comment514,Darnay. Mr. Carton was shabbily dressed and did not appear to be quitesober."This must be a strange sight to you" said Carton with a laugh."I hardly seem yet" returned Darnay "to belong to this world again.""Then why the devil don't you dine"He led him to a tavern where Darnay recruited his strength with a goodplain dinner. Carton drank but ate nothing."Now your dinner is done" Carton presently said "why don't you giveyour toast""What toast""Why it's on the tip of your tongue.""Miss Manette then"Carton drank the toast and flung his glass over his shoulder againstthe wall where it shivered in pieces.After Darnay had gone Carton drank and slept till ten o'clock and thenwalked to the chambers of Mr. Stryver. Mr. Stryver was a glib man andan unscrupulous and a bold and was fast shouldering his way to alucrative practice but it had been noted that he had not the strikingand necessary faculty of extracting evidence from a heap of statements.A remarkable improvement however came upon him as to this. SydneyCarton idlest and most unpromising of men was his great ally. What thetwo drank together would have floated a king's ship.Stryver never had a case in hand but what Carton was there with hishands in his pockets staring at the ceiling. At last it began to getabout that although Sydney Carton would never be a lion he was anamazingly good jackal and that he rendered service to Stryver in thathumble capacity. Folding wet towels on his head in a manner hideous tobehold the jackal began the "boiling down" of cases while Stryverreclined before the fire. Each had bottles and glasses ready to hishand. The work was not done until the clocks were striking three.Climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses Carton threw himselfdown in his clothes on a neglected bed. Sadly sadly the sun rose. Itrose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and goodemotions incapable of his own help and his own happiness sensible ofthe blight upon him and resigning himself to let it eat him away._III.--The Loadstone Rock_"Dear Dr. Manette" said Charles Darnay "I love your daughter fondly
comment515,devotedly. If ever there were love in the world I love her"Dr. Manette turned towards him in his chair but did not look at him orraise his eyes."Have you spoken to Lucie" he asked."No."The doctor looked up a struggle was evidently in his face--a strugglewith that look he still sometimes wore with a tendency in it to darkdoubt and dread."If Lucie should ever tell me" he said "that you are essential to herperfect happiness I will give her to you.""Your confidence in me" answered Darnay relieved "ought to bereturned with full confidence on my part. I am as you know likeyourself a voluntary exile from France. The name I bear at present isnot my own. I wish to tell you what that is and why I am in England.""Stop"The doctor laid his two hands on Darnay's lips."Tell me when I ask you not now. Go God bless you"On a day shortly before the marriage while Lucie was sitting at herwork alone Sydney Carton entered."I fear you are not well Mr. Carton" she said looking up at him."No but the life I lead is not conducive to health.""Is it not--forgive me--a pity to live no better life""It is too late for that." He covered her eyes with his hand. "Will youhear me" he continued. "Since I have known you I have been troubled bya remorse that I thought would never reproach me again. A dream all adream that ends in nothing but let me carry through the rest of mymisdirected life the remembrance that I opened my heart to you last ofall the world.""Mr. Carton" she answered after an agitated pause "I promise torespect your secret.""God bless you My last application is this that you will believe thatfor you and for any dear to you I would do anything. Oh Miss Manettethink now and then that there is a man who would give his life to keep alife you love beside you"He said "farewell" and left her.A wonderful corner for echoes was the quiet street-corner near SohoSquare where Dr. Manette lived with his daughter and her husband. ButLucie heard in the echoes none but friendly and soothing sounds. Herhusband's step was strong and prosperous among them her father's firmand equal. The time came when a little Lucie lay on her bosom. But therewere other echoes that rumbled menacingly in the distance with a sound
comment516,as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.It was August of the year 1792. Charles Darnay talked in a low voicewith Mr. Lorry in Tellson's Bank. The bank had a branch in Paris andthe London establishment was the headquarters of the aristocraticemigrants who had fled from France."And do you really go to Paris to-night" asked Darnay."I do. You can have no conception of the peril in which our books andpapers over yonder are involved and the getting them out of harm's wayis in the power of scarcely anyone but myself."As Mr. Lorry spoke a letter was laid before him. Darnay saw thedirection--it was to himself. "To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St.Evrmonde." Horrified at the oppression and cruelty of his familytowards the people Darnay had left his native country and had neverused the title that had some years before fallen to him byinheritance. He had told his secret to Dr. Manette on the weddingmorning and to none other."I know the man" he said."Will you take charge of the letter and deliver it" asked Mr. Lorry."I will."When alone Darnay opened the letter. It was from the steward of hisFrench estate. The man had been charged with acting for an emigrantagainst the people. It was in vain he had urged that by the marquis'sinstructions he had acted for the people--had remitted all rents andimposts. The only response was that he had acted for an emigrant.Nothing but the marquis's personal testimony could save him fromexecution.Could he resist his old servant's appeal He knew the peril of it buthis honour was at stake he must go. That evening he wrote two lettersexplaining his purpose one to Lucie one to the doctor. On the nextnight he went out pretending he would be back by-and-by. The twoletters he left with the trusty porter to be delivered before midnightand with a heavy heart leaving all that was dear on earth behind himhe journeyed on--drawn like the mariner in the old story to theLoadstone Rock._IV.--The Track of a Storm_In the buildings of Tellson's Bank in Paris Mr. Lorry sat by a woodfire it was early September but the blighted year was prematurelycold and on his honest face there was a deeper shade than the pendantlamp could throw--a shade of horror. By him sat Dr. Manette Lucie andher child were in an inner room. They had hastened after Darnay toParis. Dr. Manette knew that as a Bastille prisoner he bore a charmedlife in revolutionary France and that if Darnay was in danger he could
comment517,help him. Darnay was indeed in danger. He had been arrested as anaristocrat and an enemy of the Republic.From the streets there came the usual night hum of the city with nowand then an indescribable ring in it weird and unearthly as if someunwonted sounds of a terrible nature were going up to Heaven.A loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard. Mr.Lorry put his hand on the doctor's arm and they looked out.A throng of men and women crowded round a grindstone. Turning madly atits double handle were two men whose faces were more horrible and cruelthan the visages of the wildest savages. The eye could not detect onecreature in the surrounding group free from the smear of blood.Shouldering one another to get next at the sharpening-stone were menwith the stain all over their limbs and bodies hatchets knivesbayonets swords all were red with it."They are murdering the prisoners" whispered Mr. Lorry.Dr. Manette hastened out of the room and down into the courtyard. Therewas a pause a murmur and the sound of his voice. Then Mr. Lorry sawhim surrounded by all hurried out with cries of "Live the Bastilleprisoner Help for the Bastille prisoner's kindred in La Force"It was long ere he returned. He had presented himself at the prisonbefore the self-appointed tribunal that was consigning the prisoners tomassacre and had announced himself as a victim of the Bastille. Onemember of the tribunal had identified him the member was Defarge. Hehad pleaded hard for his son-in-law's life and had been informed thatthe prisoner must remain in custody but should for the doctor's sakebe held in safe custody.For fifteen months Charles Darnay remained in prison. During all thattime Lucie was never sure but that her husband's head would be struckoff next day. When at length arraigned as an emigrant whose life wasforfeit to the Republic he pleaded that he had come back to save acitizen's life. That night he sat by the fire with his family a freeman. Lucie at last was at ease."What is that" she cried suddenly.There was a knock at the door four armed men in red caps entered theroom."Evrmonde" said the first "you are again the prisoner of theRepublic""Why" he asked with his wife and child clinging to him."You will know to-morrow.""One word" entreated the doctor "who has denounced him""The Citizen Defarge and another.""What other""Citizen" said the man with a strange look "you will be answeredto-morrow."_V.--Condemned_The news that Darnay had been again arrested was brought to Mr. Lorrylater in the evening and the man who brought it was Sydney Carton. Hehad come to Paris he said on business his business was now completedhe was about to return and he had obtained his leave to pass."Darnay" he said "cannot escape condemnation this time.""I fear not" answered Mr. Lorry."I have found" continued Carton "that the Old Bailey spy who chargedDarnay with high treason years ago is now in the service of the Republicand is a turnkey at the prison of the Conciergerie where Darnay isconfined. By threatening to denounce him as a spy of Pitt I havesecured that I shall gain access to Darnay in the prison if the trialshould go against him.""But access to him" said Mr. Lorry "will not save him.""I never said it would."Mr. Lorry looked at him mystified and once more noted his strangeresemblance to the man whose fate was to be decided on the morrow.Carton stood next day in an obscure corner among the crowd when CharlesEvrmonde called Darnay appeared again before the judges."Who denounces the accused" asked the president.
comment518,"Ernest Defarge wine-vendor.""Good.""Alexandre Manette physician.""President" cried the doctor pale and trembling "I indignantlyprotest to you.""Citizen Manette be silent Call Citizen Defarge."Rapidly Defarge told his story. He had been among the leaders in thetaking of the Bastille. When the citadel had fallen he had gone to thecell One Hundred and Five North Tower and had searched it. In a holein the chimney he had found a paper in the handwriting of Dr. Manette."Let it be read" said the president.In this paper Dr. Manette had written the history of his imprisonment.In the year 1757 he had been taken secretly by two nobles to visit twopoor people who were on the point of death. One was a woman whom one ofthe nobles had forcibly carried off from her husband the other herbrother whom the seducer had mortally wounded. The doctor had come toolate both the woman and her brother died. The doctor refused a feeand to relieve his mind wrote privately to the government stating thecircumstances of the crime. One night he was called out of his home on afalse pretext and taken to the Bastille.The nobles were the Marquis de St. Evrmonde and his brother and theMarquis was the father of Charles Darnay. A terrible sound arose in thecourt when the reading was done. The voting of the jury was unanimousand at every vote there was a roar. Death in twenty-four hoursThat night Carton again came to Mr. Lorry. Between the two men as theyspoke a figure on a chair rocked itself to and fro moaning. It was Dr.Manette."He and Lucie and her child must leave Paris to-morrow" said Carton."They are in danger of being denounced. It is a capital crime to mournfor or sympathise with a victim of the guillotine. Be ready to startat two o'clock to-morrow afternoon. See them into their seats take yourown seat. The moment I come to you take me in and drive away."It shall be done."Carton turned to the couch where Lucie lay unconscious prostrated withutter grief.He bent down touched her face with his lips and murmured some words.Little Lucie told them afterwards that she heard him say "A life youlove."_VI.--The Guillotine_In the black prison of the Conciergerie the doomed of the day awaitedtheir fate. Fifty-two persons were to roll that afternoon on thelife-tide of the city to the boundless everlasting sea.The hours went on as Darnay walked to and fro in his cell and theclocks struck the numbers he would never hear again. The final hour heknew was three and he expected to be summoned at two. The clocksstruck one. "There is but another now" he thought.He heard footsteps. The door was opened and there stood before himquiet intent and smiling Sydney Carton."Darnay" he said "I bring you a request from your wife.""What is it""There is no time--you must comply. Take off your boots and coat andput on mine.""Carton there is no escaping from this place. It is madness.""Do I ask you to escape" said Carton forcing the changes upon him.
comment519,"Now sit at the table and write what I dictate.""To whom do I address it""To no one.""If you remember" said Carton dictating "the words that passedbetween us long ago you will comprehend this when you see it. I amthankful that the time has come when I can prove them." Carton's handwas withdrawn from his breast and slowly and softly moved down thewriter's face. For a few seconds Darnay struggled faintly Carton's handheld firmly at his nostrils then he fell senseless to the ground.Carton called quietly to the turnkey who looked in and went again asCarton was putting the paper in Darnay's breast. He came back with twomen. They raised the unconscious figure and carried it away.The door closed and Carton was left alone. Straining his powers oflistening to the utmost he listened for any sound that might denotesuspicion or alarm. There was none. Presently his door opened and agaoler looked in merely saying "Follow me" whereupon Carton followedhim into a dark room. As he stood by the wall in a dim corner a youngwoman with a slight girlish figure came to speak to him."Citizen Evrmonde" she said "I am a poor little seamstress who waswith you in La Force."He murmured an answer."I heard you were released.""I was and was taken again and condemned.""If I may ride with you will you let me hold your hand"As the patient eyes were lifted to his face he saw a sudden doubt inthem."Are you dying for him" she whispered. "Oh you will let me hold yourhand""Hush Yes my poor sister to the last."That afternoon a coach going out of Paris drove up to the Barrier."Papers" demanded the guard. The papers are handed out and read."Alexandre Manette Lucie Manette her child. Jarvis Lorry bankerEnglish. Sydney Carton advocate English. Which is he"He lies here in a corner apparently in a swoon. He is in bad health."Behold your papers countersigned.""One can depart citizen""One can depart."The ministers of Sainte Guillotin are robed and ready. Crash--and thewomen who sit with their knitting in front of the guillotine count one.Crash--and the women count two.The supposed Evrmonde descends with the seamstress from the tumbriland joins the fast-thinning throng of victims before the crashing enginethat constantly whirrs up and falls. The spare hand does not tremble ashe grasps it. She goes next before him--is gone. The knitting womencount twenty-two.The murmuring of many voices the pressing on of many footsteps in theoutskirts of the crowd so that it swells forward like one great heaveof water all flashes away. Twenty-three.They said of him about the city that night that it was the peacefulestman's face ever beheld there. Had he given utterance to his thoughts atthe foot of the scaffold they would have been these"I see the lives for which I lay down my life peaceful usefulprosperous and happy in that England which I shall see no more. I seeher with a child upon her bosom who bears my name. I see that I hold asanctuary in their hearts and in the hearts of their descendantsgenerations hence."It is a far far better thing that I do than I have ever done it is afar far better rest that I go to than I have ever known."                                   BENJAMIN DISRAELIConingsby      Benjamin Disraeli Earl of Beaconsfield was not only a great     figure in English politics in the nineteenth century he was     also a novelist of brilliant powers. Born in London on     December 21 1804 the son of Isaac D'Israeli the future     Prime Minister of England was first articled to a solicitor
comment520,     but he quickly turned from this to politics. Disraeli was     leader of the Conservative Party in the House of Commons in     1847 he was twice Prime Minister. In 1876 he was created Earl     of Beaconsfield. Disraeli's novels--especially the famous     trilogy of "Coningsby" 1844 "Sybil" 1845 and "Tancred"     1846--are remarkable chiefly for the view they give of     contemporary political life and for the definite political     philosophy of their author. Neither the earlier     novels--"Vivian Grey" 1826 "Contarini Fleming" "Alroy"     1832 "Henrietta Temple" and "Venetia" 1837--nor the later     ones--"Lothair" 1870 and "Endymion" 1874--are to be ranked     with "Coningsby" and "Sybil." Many characters in "Coningsby"     are well-known men. Lord Monmouth is Lord Hertford whom     Thackeray depicted as the Marquess of Steyne Rigby is John     Wilson Croker Oswald Millbank is Mr. Gladstone Lord H.     Sydney is Lord John Manners Sidonia is Baron Alfred de     Rothschild and Coningsby is Lord Lyttelton. Lord Beaconsfield     died in London on April 19 1881._I.--The Hero of Eton_Coningsby was the orphan child of the younger of the two sons of LordMonmouth. It was a family famous for its hatreds. The elder son hatedhis father and lived at Naples maintaining no connection either withhis parent or his native country. On the other hand Lord Monmouth hatedhis younger son who had married against his consent a woman to whomthat son was devoted. Persecuted by his father he died abroad and hiswidow returned to England. Not having a relation and scarcely anacquaintance in the world she made an appeal to her husband's fatherthe wealthiest noble in England and a man who was often prodigal andoccasionally generous who respected law and despised opinion. LordMonmouth decided that provided she gave up her child and permanentlyresided in one of the remotest counties he would make her a yearlyallowance of three hundred pounds. Necessity made the victim yield andthree years later Mrs. Coningsby died the same day that her father-in-law was made a marquess.Coningsby was then not more than nine years of age and when he attainedhis twelfth year an order was received from Lord Monmouth who was atRome that he should go at once to Eton.Coningsby had never seen his grandfather. It was Mr. Rigby who madearrangements for his education. This Mr. Rigby was the manager of LordMonmouth's parliamentary influence and the auditor of his vast estates.He was a member for one of Lord Monmouth's boroughs and in fact agreat personage. Lord Monmouth had bought him and it was a goodpurchase.In the spring of 1832 when the country was in the throes of agitationover the Reform Bill Lord Monmouth returned to England accompanied bythe Prince and Princess Colonna and the Princess Lucretia the prince'sdaughter by his first wife. Coningsby was summoned from Eton to MonmouthHouse and returned to school in the full favour of the marquess.Coningsby was the hero of Eton everybody was proud of him talked ofhim quoted him imitated him. But the ties of friendship boundConingsby to Henry Sydney and Oswald Millbank above all companions. LordHenry Sydney was the son of a duke and Millbank was the son of one of
comment521,the wealthiest manufacturers in Lancashire. Once on the riverConingsby saved Millbank's life and this was the beginning of a closeand ardent friendship.Coningsby liked very much to talk politics with Millbank. He heardthings from Millbank which were new to him. Politics had as yetappeared to him a struggle whether the country was to be governed byWhig nobles or Tory nobles and Coningsby a high Tory as he supposedhimself to be thought it very unfortunate that he should probably haveto enter life with his friends out of power and his family boroughsdestroyed. But in conversing with Millbank he heard for the first timeof influential classes in the country who were not noble and were yetdetermined to acquire power.Generally at that time among the upper boys at Eton there was areigning inclination for political discussion and a feeling in favourof "Conservative principles." A year later and in 1836 gradually theinquiry fell upon attentive ears as to what these Conservativeprinciples were. Before Coningsby and his friends left Eton--Coningsbyfor Cambridge and Millbank for Oxford--they were resolved to contendfor political faith rather than for mere partisan success or personalambition._II.--A Portrait of a Lady_On his way to Coningsby Castle in Lancashire where the Marquess ofMonmouth was living in state--feasting the county patronising theborough and diffusing confidence in the Conservative party in orderthat the electors of Dartford might return his man Mr. Rigby once morefor parliament--our hero halted for the night at Manchester. In thecoffee-room at the hotel a stranger loud in praise of the commercialenterprise of the neighbourhood advised Coningsby if he wanted to seesomething tip-top in the way of cotton works to visit Millbank ofMillbank's and thus it came about that Coningsby first met EdithMillbank. Oswald was abroad and Mr. Millbank when he heard the name ofhis visitor was only distressed that the sudden arrival left no timefor adequate welcome."My visit to Manchester which led to this was quite accidental" saidConingsby. "I am bound for the other division of the county to pay avisit to my grandfather Lord Monmouth but an irresistible desire cameover me during my journey to view this famous district of industry."A cloud passed over the countenance of Millbank as the name of LordMonmouth was mentioned but he said nothing only turning towardsConingsby with an air of kindness to beg him since to stay longer wasimpossible to dine with him. Coningsby gladly agreed to this and thevillage clock was striking five when Mr. Millbank and his guest enteredthe gardens of his mansion and proceeded to the house.The hall was capacious and classic and as they approached the staircasethe sweetest and the clearest voice exclaimed from above "Papa papa"and instantly a young girl came bounding down the stairs but suddenlyseeing a stranger with her father she stopped upon the landing-place.Mr. Millbank beckoned her and she came down slowly at the foot of thestairs her father said briefly "A friend you have often heard ofEdith--this is Mr. Coningsby."
comment522,She started blushed very much and then put forth her hand."How often have we all wished to see and to thank you" Miss EdithMillbank remarked in tones of sensibility.Opposite Coningsby at dinner that night was a portrait which greatlyattracted his attention. It represented a woman extremely young and of arare beauty. The face was looking out of the canvas and the gaze ofthis picture disturbed the serenity of Coningsby. On rising to leave thetable he said to Mr. Millbank "By whom is that portrait sir"The countenance of Millbank became disturbed his expression wasagitated almost angry. "Oh that is by a country artist" he said "ofwhom you never heard."_III.--The Course of True Love_The Princess Colonna resolved that an alliance should take place betweenConingsby and her step-daughter. But the plans of the princess impartedto Mr. Rigby that she might gain his assistance in achieving them weredoomed to frustration. Coningsby fell deeply in love with Miss Millbankand Lord Monmouth himself decided to marry Lucretia.It was in Paris that Coningsby on a visit to his grandfather woke tothe knowledge of his love for Edith Millbank. They met at a brilliantparty Miss Millbank in the care of her aunt Lady Wallinger."Miss Millbank says that you have quite forgotten her" said a mutualfriend.Coningsby started advanced coloured a little could not conceal hissurprise. The lady too though more prepared was not withoutconfusion. Coningsby recalled at that moment the beautiful bashfulcountenance that had so charmed him at Millbank but two years hadeffected a wonderful change and transformed the silent embarrassedgirl into a woman of surpassing beauty. That night the image of EdithMillbank was the last thought of Coningsby as he sank into an agitatedslumber. In the morning his first thought was of her of whom he haddreamed. The light had dawned on his soul. Coningsby loved.The course of true love was not to run smoothly with our hero. Within afew days he heard rumours that Miss Millbank was to be married toSidonia a wealthy and gifted man of the Jewish race the friend of LordMonmouth. Often had Coningsby admired the wisdom and the abilities ofSidonia against such a rival he felt powerless and without musteringcourage to speak left hastily for England.But Coningsby had been deceived--the gossip was without foundation andonce more he was to meet Edith Millbank. This time however it was Mr.Millbank himself who vetoed the courtship.Oswald had invited his friend to Millbank and Coningsby having learntthe baselessness of the report that had driven him from Paris gladlyaccepted. Coningsby Castle was near to Hellingsley and this estate Mr.Millbank had purchased outbidding Lord Monmouth. Bitter enmity existedbetween the great marquess and the famous manufacturer--an oldimplacable hatred. Mr. Millbank now resided at Hellingsley andConingsby left the castle rejoicing to meet his old Eton friend againand still more the beautiful sister of his old friend.Mr. Millbank was from home when he arrived and Coningsby and MissMillbank walked in the park and rested by the margin of a stream.Assuredly a maiden and a youth more beautiful and engaging had seldommet in a scene more fresh and fair.Coningsby gazed on the countenance of his companion. She turned herhead and met his glance."Edith" he said in a tone of tremulous passion "let me call youEdith Yes" he continued gently taking her hand "let me call you myEdith I love you"She did not withdraw her hand but turned away a face flushed as theimpending twilight.The lovers returned late for dinner to find that Mr. Millbank was athome.Next morning in Mr. Millbank's room Coningsby learnt that the marriagehe looked forward to with all the ardour of youth was quite impossible.
comment523,"The sacrifices and the misery of such a marriage are certain andinseparable" said Mr. Millbank gravely but without harshness. "You arethe grandson of Lord Monmouth at present enjoying his favour butdependent on his bounty. You may be the heir of his wealth to-morrow andto-morrow you may be the object of his hatred and persecution. Yourgrandfather and myself are foes--to the death. It is idle to mincephrases. I do not vindicate our mutual feelings I may regret that theyhave ever arisen especially at this exigency. Lord Monmouth would crushme had he the power like a worm and I have curbed his proud fortunesoften. These feelings of hatred may be deplored but they do not existand now you are to go to this man and ask his sanction to marry mydaughter""I would appease these hatreds" retorted Coningsby "the origin ofwhich I know not. I would appeal to my grandfather. I would show himEdith.""He has looked upon as fair even as Edith" said Mr. Millbank. "And didthat melt his heart My daughter and yourself can meet no more."In vain Coningsby pleaded his suit. It was not till Mr. Millbank toldthat he too had suffered--that he had loved Coningsby's own motherand that she gave her heart to another to die afterwards solitary andforsaken tortured by Lord Monmouth--that Coningsby was silent. It washis mother's portrait he had looked upon that night at Millbank and heunderstood the cause of the hatred.He wrung Mr. Millbank's hand and left Hellingsley in despair. ButOswald overtook him in the park and leaning on his friend's armConingsby poured forth a hurried impassioned and incoherent strain--all that had occurred all that he had dreamed his baffled bliss hisactual despair his hopeless outlook.A thunderstorm overtook them and Oswald took refuge from the elementsat the castle. There as they sat together pledging their faithfulfriendship the door opened and Mr. Rigby appeared._IV.--Coningsby's Political Faith_Lord Monmouth banished the Princess Colonna from his presence andmarried Lucretia. Coningsby returned to Cambridge and continued toenjoy his grandfather's hospitality whenever Lord Monmouth was inLondon.Mr. Millbank had in the meantime become a member of parliament havingdefeated Mr. Rigby in the contest for the representation of Dartford.In the year 1840 a general election was imminent and Lord Monmouthreturned to London. He was weary of Paris every day he found it moredifficult to be amused. Lucretia had lost her charm they had beenmarried nearly three years. The marquess from whom nothing could beconcealed perceived that often while she elaborately attempted todivert him her mind was wandering elsewhere.He fell into the easy habit of dining in his private rooms sometimes_tte--tte_ with Villebecque his private secretary a cosmopolitantheatrical manager whose tales and adventures about a kind of societywhich Lord Monmouth had always preferred to the polished and somewhatinsipid circles in which he was born had rendered him the primefavourite of his great patron. Villebecque's step-daughter Flora amodest and retiring maiden waited on Lucretia.Back in London Lord Monmouth on the day of his arrival welcomedConingsby to his room and at a sign from his master Villebecque leftthe apartment."You see Harry" said Lord Monmouth "that I am much occupied to-dayyet the business on which I wish to communicate with you is so pressingthat it could not be postponed. These are not times when young menshould be out of sight. Your public career will commence immediately.The government have resolved on a dissolution. My information is fromthe highest quarter. The Whigs are going to dissolve their own House ofCommons. Notwithstanding this we can beat them but the race requiresthe finest jockeying. We can't give a point. Now if we had a goodcandidate we could win Dartford. But Rigby won't do. He is too much of
comment524,the old clique used up a hack besides a beaten horse. We are assuredthe name of Coningsby would be a host there is a considerable sectionwho support the present fellow who will not vote against a Coningsby.They have thought of you as a fit person and I have approved of thesuggestion. You will therefore be the candidate for Dartford with myentire sanction and support and I have no doubt you will besuccessful."To Coningsby the idea was appalling. To be the rival of Mr. Millbank onthe hustings of Dartford Vanquished or victorious equally acatastrophe. He saw Edith canvassing for her father and against him.Besides to enter the House of Commons a slave and a tool of partyStrongly anti-Whig Coningsby distrusted the Conservative party andlooked for a new party of men who shared his youthful convictions andhigh political principles.Lord Monmouth however brushed aside his grandson's objections."You are certainly still young but I was younger by nearly two yearswhen I first went in and I found no difficulty. As for your opinionsyou have no business to have any other than those I uphold. I want tosee you in parliament. I tell you what it is Harry" Lord Monmouthconcluded very emphatically "members of this family may think as theylike but they must act as I please. You must go down on Friday toDartford and declare yourself a candidate for the town or I shallreconsider our mutual positions."Coningsby left Monmouth House in dejection but to his solemn resolutionof political faith he remained firm. He would not stand for Dartfordagainst Mr. Millbank as the nominee of a party he could not follow. Interms of tenderness and humility he wrote to his grandfather that hepositively declined to enter parliament except as the master of his ownconduct.In the same hour of his distress Coningsby overheard in his club two mendiscussing the engagement of Miss Millbank to the Marquess ofBeaumanoir the elder brother of his school friend Henry Sydney.Edith Millbank too had heard news at a London assembly of wealth andfashion that Coningsby was engaged to be married to Lady Theresa Sydney.So easily does rumour spin her stories and smite her victims withsadness._V.--Lady Monmouth's Departure_It was Flora to whom Coningsby had been always kind and courteous whotold Lucretia that Lord Monmouth was displeased with his grandson."My lord is very angry with Mr. Coningsby" she said shaking her headmournfully. "My lord told M. Villebecque that perhaps Mr. Coningsbywould never enter the house again."Lucretia immediately dispatched a note to Mr. Rigby and on the arrivalof that gentleman told him all she had learnt of the contention betweenHarry Coningsby and her husband."I told you to beware of him long ago" said Lady Monmouth. "He has everbeen in the way of both of us.""He is in my power" said Rigby. "We can crush him. He is in love withthe daughter of Millbank the man who bought Hellingsley. I found theyounger Millbank quite domiciliated at the castle a fact which ofitself if known to Lord Monmouth would ensure the lad's annihilation."
comment525,"The time is now most mature for this. Let us not conceal it fromourselves that since this grandson's first visit to Coningsby Castle wehave neither of us really been in the same position with my lord whichwe then occupied or believed we should occupy. Go now the game isbefore you Rid me of this Coningsby and I will secure all that youwant.""It shall be done" said Rigby "it must be done."Lady Monmouth bade Mr. Rigby hasten at once to the marquess and bringher news of the interview. She awaited with some excitement his return.Her original prejudice against Coningsby and jealousy of his influencehad been aggravated by the knowledge that although after her marriageLord Monmouth had made a will which secured to her a very large portionof his great wealth the energies and resources of the marquess had oflate been directed to establish Coningsby in a barony.Two hours elapsed before Mr. Rigby returned. There was a churlish andunusual look about him."Lord Monmouth suggests that as you were tired of Paris your ladyshipmight find the German baths at Kissingen agreeable. A paragraph in the'Morning Post' would announce that his lordship was about to join youand even if his lordship did not ultimately reach you an amicableseparation would be effected."In vain Lucretia stormed. Mr. Rigby mentioned that Lord Monmouth hadalready left the house and would not return and finally announced thatLucretia's letters to a certain Prince Trautsmandorff were in hislordship's possession.A few days later and Coningsby read in the papers of Lady Monmouth'sdeparture to Kissingen. He called at Monmouth House to find the placeempty and to learn from the porter that Lord Monmouth was about tooccupy a villa at Richmond.Coningsby entertained for his grandfather a sincere affection. With theexception of their last unfortunate interview he had experiencednothing but kindness from Lord Monmouth. He determined to pay him avisit at Richmond.Lord Monmouth who was entertaining two French ladies at his villarecoiled from grandsons and relations and ties of all kinds butConingsby so pleasantly impressed his fair visitors that Lord Monmouthdecided to ask him to dinner. Thus in spite of the combinations ofLucretia and Mr. Rigby and his grandfather's resentment within a monthof the memorable interview at Monmouth House Coningsby found himselfonce more a welcome guest at Lord Monmouth's table.In that same month other important circumstances also occurred.At a fte in some beautiful gardens on the banks of the Thames
comment526,Coningsby and Edith Millbank were both present. The announcement wasmade of the forthcoming marriage of Lady Theresa Sydney to Mr. EustaceLyle a friend of Mr. Coningsby and later from the lips of LadyWallinger herself Miss Millbank's aunt Coningsby learnt how reallygroundless was the report of Lord Beaumanoir's engagement."Lord Beaumanoir admires her--has always admired her" Lady Wallingerexplained to Coningsby "but Edith has given him no encouragementwhatever."At the end of the terrace Edith and Coningsby met. He seized theoccasion to walk some distance by her side."How could you ever doubt me" said Coningsby after some time."I was unhappy.""And now we are to each other as before.""And will be come what may" said Edith._VI.--Lord Monmouth's Money_In the midst of Christmas-revels at the country house of Mr. EustaceLyle surrounded by the duke and duchess and their children--theSydneys--Coningsby was called away by a messenger who brought news ofthe sudden death of Lord Monmouth. The marquess had died at supper athis Richmond villa with no persons near him but those who were veryamusing.The body had been removed to Monmouth House and after the funeral inthe principal saloon of Monmouth House the will was eventually read.The date of the will was 1829 and by this document the sum of 10000was left to Coningsby who at that time was unknown to his grandfather.But there were many codicils. In 1832 the 10000 was increased to50000. In 1836 after Coningsby's visit to the castle 50000 wasleft to the Princess Lucretia and Coningsby was left sole residuarylegatee.After the marriage an estate of 9000 a year was left to Coningsby20000 to Mr. Rigby and the whole of the residue went to issue by LadyMonmouth.In the event of there being no issue the whole of the estate was to bedivided equally between Lady Monmouth and Coningsby. In 1839 Mr. Rigbywas reduced to 10000 Lady Monmouth was to receive 3000 per annumand the rest without reserve went absolutely to Coningsby.The last codicil was dated immediately after the separation with LadyMonmouth.All dispositions in favour of Coningsby were revoked and he was leftwith the interest of the original 10000 the executors to invest themoney as they thought best for his advancement provided it were notplaced in any manufactory.Mr. Rigby received 5000 M. Villebecque 30000 and all the restresidue and remainder to Flora commonly called Flora Villebecquestep-child of Armand Villebecque "but who is my natural daughter by anactress at the Thtre Franais in the years 1811-15 by the name ofStella."Sidonia lightened the blow for Coningsby as far as philosophy could beof use."I ask you" he said "which would you have rather lost--yourgrandfather's inheritance or your right leg""Most certainly my inheritance.""Or your left arm""Still the inheritance.""Would you have given up a year of your life for that fortune trebled""Even at twenty-three I would have refused the terms.""Come then Coningsby the calamity cannot be very great. You havehealth youth good looks great abilities considerable knowledge afine courage and no contemptible experience. You can live on 300 ayear. Read for the Bar.""I have resolved" said Coningsby. "I will try for the Great Seal"Next morning came a note from Flora begging Mr. Coningsby to call uponher. It was an interview he would rather have avoided. But Flora had notinjured him and she was after all his kin. She was alone whenConingsby entered the room."I have robbed you of your inheritance.""It was not mine by any right legal or moral. The fortune is yours
comment527,dear Flora by every right and there is no one who wishes morefervently that it may contribute to your happiness than I do.""It is killing me" said Flora mournfully. "I must tell you what I feel.This fortune is yours. I never thought to be so happy as I shall be ifyou will generously accept it.""You are as I have ever thought you the kindest and mosttender-hearted of beings" said Coningsby much moved "but the customof the world does not permit such acts to either of us as youcontemplate. Have confidence in yourself. You will be happy.""When I die these riches will be yours that at all events you cannotprevent" were Flora's last generous words._VII.--On Life's Threshold_Coningsby established himself in the Temple to read law and Lord HenrySydney Oswald Millbank and other old Eton friends rallied round theirearly leader."I feel quite convinced that Coningsby will become Lord Chancellor"Henry Sydney said gravely after leaving the Temple.The General Election of 1841 which Lord Monmouth had expected a yearbefore found Coningsby a solitary student in his lonely chambers in theTemple. All his friends and early companions were candidates and withsanguine prospects. They sent their addresses to Coningsby who deeplyinterested traced in them the influence of his own mind.Then in the midst of the election one evening in July Coningsbycatching up a third edition of the "Sun" was startled by the word"Dartford" in large type. Below it were the headlines"Extraordinary Affair Withdrawal of the Liberal Candidate Two ToryCandidates in the Field"Mr. Millbank at the last moment had retired and had persuaded hissupporters to nominate Harry Coningsby in his place. The fight wasbetween Coningsby and Rigby.Oswald Millbank who had just been returned to parliament came up toLondon and from him as they travelled to Dartford Coningsby graspedthe change of events. Sidonia had explained to Lady Wallinger the causeof Coningsby's disinheritance. Lady Wallinger had told Oswald and Edithand Oswald had urged on his father the recognition of his friend'saffection for his sister.On his own impulse Mr. Millbank decided that Coningsby should contestDartford.Mr. Rigby was beaten and Coningsby arrived at Dartford in time toreceive the cheers of thousands. From the hustings he gave his firstaddress to a public assembly and by general agreement no such speechhad ever been heard in the borough before.Early in the autumn Harry and Edith were married at Millbank and theypassed their first moon at Hellingsley.The death of Flora who had bequeathed the whole of her fortune to thehusband of Edith took place before the end of the year hastened by thefatal inheritance which disturbed her peace and embittered her dayshaunting her heart with the recollection that she had been theinstrument of injuring the only being whom she loved.Coningsby passed his next Christmas in his own hall with his beautifuland gifted wife by his side and surrounded by the friends of his heartand his youth.The young couple stand now on the threshold of public life. What will betheir fate Will they maintain in august assemblies and high places thegreat truths which in study and in solitude they have embraced Orwill vanity confound their fortunes and jealousy wither theirsympathies                                   Sybil or the Two Nations      "Sybil or the Two Nations" was published in 1845 a year     after "Coningsby" and in it the novelist "considered the     condition of the people." The author himself writing in 1870     of this novel said "At that time the Chartist agitation was     still fresh in the public memory and its repetition was far     from improbable. I had visited and observed with care all the     localities introduced and as an accurate and never
comment528,     exaggerated picture of a remarkable period in our domestic     history and of a popular organisation which in its extent and     completeness has perhaps never been equalled the pages of     "Sybil" may I venture to believe be consulted with     confidence." "Sybil" indeed is not only an extremely     interesting novel but as a study of social life in England it     is of very definite historical value._I.--Hard Times for the Poor_It was Derby Day 1837. Charles Egremont was in the ring at Epsom with aband of young patricians. Groups surrounded the betting post and theodds were shouted lustily by a host of horsemen. Egremont had backedCaravan to win and Caravan lost by half a length. Charles Egremont wasthe younger brother of the Earl of Marney he had received 15000 onthe death of his father and had spent it. Disappointed in love at theage of twenty-four Egremont left England to return after eighteenmonths' absence a much wiser man. He was now conscious that he wanted anobject and musing over action was ignorant how to act.The morning after the Derby Egremont breakfasting with his motherlearnt that King William IV. was dying and that a dissolution ofparliament was at hand. Lady Marney was a great stateswoman a leader infashionable politics."Charles" said Lady Marney "you must stand for the old borough forMarbury. No doubt the contest will be very expensive but it will be ahappy day for me to see you in parliament and Marney will of coursesupply the funds. I shall write to him and perhaps you will do soyourself."The election took place and Egremont was returned. Then he paid a visitto his brother at Marney Abbey and an old estrangement between the twowas ended.Marney Abbey was as remarkable for its comfort and pleasantness ofaccommodation as for its ancient state and splendour. It had been areligious house. The founder of the Marney family a confidentialdomestic of one of the favourites of Henry VIII. had contrived byunscrupulous zeal to obtain the grant of the abbey lands and in thereign of Elizabeth came a peerage.The present Lord Marney upheld the workhouse hated allotments andinfant schools and declared the labourers on his estate to be happy andcontented with a wage of seven shillings a week.The burning of hayricks on the Abbey Farm at the time of Egremont'svisit showed that the torch of the incendiary had been introduced andthat a beacon had been kindled in the agitated neighbourhood. For miserylurked in the wretched tenements of the town of Marney and fever wasrife. The miserable hovels of the people had neither windows nor doorsand were unpaved and looked as if they could scarcely hold together.There were few districts in the kingdom where the rate of wages was moredepressed."What do you think of this fire" said Egremont to a labourer at theAbbey Farm."I think 'tis hard times for the poor sir" was the reply given with ashake of the head._II.--The Old Tradition_"Why was England not the same land as in the days of his light-heartedyouth" Charles Egremont mused as he wandered among the ruins of theancient abbey. "Why were these hard times for the poor" Brooding overthese questions he observed two men hard by in the old cloister gardenone of lofty stature nearer forty than fifty years of age the otheryounger and shorter with a pale face redeemed from ugliness by itsintellectual brow. Egremont joined the strangers and talked."Our queen reigns over two nations between whom there is no intercourse
comment529,and no sympathy--the rich and the poor" said the younger stranger.As he spoke from the lady chapel rose the evening hymn to the Virgin intones of almost supernatural tenderness.The melody ceased and Egremont beheld a female form a countenanceyouthful and of a beauty as rare as it was choice.The two men joined the beautiful maiden and the three quitted the abbeygrounds together without another word and pursued their way to therailway station."I have seen the tomb of the last abbot of Marney and I marked yourname on the stone my father" said the maiden. "You must regain ourlands for us Stephen" she added to the younger man."I can't understand why you lost sight of those papers Walter" saidStephen Morley."You see friend they were never in my possession they were not minewhen I saw them. They were my father's. He was a small yeomanwell-to-do in the world but always hankering after the old traditionthat the lands were ours. This Hatton got hold of him he did his workwell I have heard. It is twenty-five years since my father brought hiswrit of right and though baffled he was not beaten. Then he died hisaffairs were in great confusion he had mortgaged his land for his writ.There were debts that could not be paid. I had no capital. I would notsink to be a labourer. I had heard much of the high wages of this newindustry I left the land.""And the papers""I never thought of them or thought of them with disgust as the causeof my ruin. Of Hatton I have not heard since my father's death. He hadquitted Mowbray and none could give me tidings of him. When you cameand showed me in a book that the last abbot of Marney was a WalterGerard the old feeling stirred again and though I am but theoverlooker at Mr. Trafford's mill I could not help telling you that myfathers fought at Agincourt."They approached the station entered the train and two hours laterarrived at Mowbray. Gerard and Morley left their companion at a conventgate in the suburbs of the manufacturing town.The two men made their way through the streets and entered a prominentpublic house. Here they sought an interview with the landlord and fromhim got information of Hatton's brother."You have heard of a place called Hell-house Yard" said the publican."Well he lives there and his name is Simon and that's all I knowabout him."_III.--The Gulf Impassable_When it came to the point Lord Marney very much objected to paying
comment530,Egremont's election expenses and proposed instead that he shouldaccompany him to Mowbray Castle and marry Earl Mowbray's daughter LadyJoan Fitz-Warene.Lord Mowbray was the grandson of a waiter who had gone out to India agentleman's valet and returned a nabob. Lord Mowbray's two daughters--he had no sons--were great heiresses. Lady Joan was doctrinal Lady Maudinquisitive. Egremont fell in love with neither and the visit was afailure. Lord Marney declined to pay the election expenses.The brothers parted in anger and Egremont took up his abode in acottage in Mowedale a few miles outside the town of Mowbray. He wasdrawn to this by the knowledge that Walter Gerard and his daughterSybil and their friend Stephen Morley lived close by. Of Egremont'srank these three were ignorant. Sybil had met him with Mr. St. Lys thegood vicar of Mowbray relieving the misery of a poor weaver's family inthe town and at Mowedale he passed as Mr. Franklin a journalist.For some weeks Egremont enjoyed the peace of rural life and theintercourse with the Gerards ripened into friendship. When the time camefor parting for Egremont had to take his seat in parliament it was atender farewell on both sides.Egremont embarrassed by his deception could not only speak vaguely oftheir meeting again soon. The thought of parting from Sybil nearlyoverwhelmed him.When he met Gerard and Morley again it was in London and disguise wasno longer possible. Gerard and Morley came as delegates to the ChartistNational Convention in 1839 and deputed by their fellows to interviewCharles Egremont M.P. came face to face with "Mr. Franklin."The general misery in the country at that time was appalling. Weaversand miners were starving agricultural labourers were driven into thenew workhouses and riots were of common occurrence. The Chartistsbelieved their proposals would improve matters other working-classleaders believed that a general stoppage of work would be moreeffective.Sybil in London with her father ardently supported the popularmovement. Meeting Egremont near Westminster Abbey on the very day afterGerard and Morley had waited upon him she allowed him to escort herhome. Then for the first time she learnt that her friend "Mr.Franklin" was the brother of Lord Marney.It was in vain Egremont urged that they might still be friends that thegulf between rich and poor was not impassable."Oh sir" said Sybil haughtily "I am one of those who believe the gulfis impassable--yes utterly impassable"_IV.--Plotting Against Lord De Mowbray_Stephen Morley was the editor of the "Mowbray Phoenix" a teetotaler avegetarian a believer in moral force. The friend of Gerard and in lovewith Sybil Stephen looked with no favour on Egremont. Although adelegate to the Chartist Convention Stephen had not forgotten theclaims of Gerard to landed estate and had pursued his inquiries as tothe whereabouts of Hatton with some success.
comment531,First Stephen had journeyed to Woodgate commonly known as Hell-houseYard a wild and savage place the abode of a lawless race of men whofashioned locks and instruments of iron. Here he had found Simon Hattonwho knew nothing of his brother's residence.By accident Stephen discovered that the man he sought lived in theTemple. Baptist Hatton at that time was the most famous of heraldicantiquaries. Not a pedigree in dispute not a peerage in abeyance butit was submitted to his consideration. A solitary man was BaptistHatton wealthy and absorbed in his pursuits. The meeting with Morleyexcited him and he turned over the matter anxiously in his mind as hesat alone."The son of Walter Gerard a Chartist delegate The best blood inEngland Those infernal papers They made my fortune and yet the deedhas cost me many a pang. It seemed innoxious the old man deadinsolvent myself starving his son ignorant of all--to whom could theybe of use for it required thousands to work them And yet with all mywealth and power what memory shall I leave Not a relative in the worldexcept a barbarian. Ah had I a child like the beautiful daughter ofGerard. I have seen her. He must be a fiend who could injure her. I amthat fiend. Let me see what can be done. What if I married her"But Hatton did not offer marriage to Sybil. He did much to make her stayin London pleasant but there was something about the maiden that awedwhile it fascinated him. A Catholic himself Hatton was not surprised tohear from Gerard of Sybil's wish to enter a convent. "And to my mind sheis right. My daughter cannot look to marriage no man that she couldmarry would be worthy of her."This did not deter Hatton from considering how the papers relating toGerard's lost estates could be recovered.The first move was an action entered against Lord de Mowbray and thisbrought that distinguished peer to Mr. Hatton's chambers in the Templefor Hatton was at that time advising Lord de Mowbray in the matter ofreviving an ancient barony. Hatton easily quieted his client."Mr. Walter Gerard can do nothing without the deed of '77. Yourdocuments you say are all secure""They are at this moment in the muniment room of the tower of MowbrayCastle.""Keep them this action is a feint."As for Mr. Baptist Hatton the next time we see him a few months hadelapsed. He is at the principal hotel in Mowbray in consultation withStephen Morley.A great labour demonstration had taken place the previous night on themoors outside the town and Gerard had been acclaimed as a popular hero."Documents are in existence" said Hatton "which prove the title ofWalter Gerard to the proprietorship of this great district. Two hundredthousand human beings yesterday acknowledged the supremacy of Gerard.Suppose they had known that within the walls of Mowbray Castle werecontained the proofs that Walter Gerard was the lawful possessor of thelands on which they live Moral force is a fine thing friend Morleybut the public spirit is inflamed here. You are a leader of the people.Let us have another meeting on the Moor you can put your fingers in atrice on the man who will do our work. Mowbray Castle in theirpossession a certain iron chest painted blue and blazoned with theshield of Valence would be delivered to you. You shall have 10000down and I will take you back to London besides.""The effort would fail" said Stephen Morley. "Wages must drop stillmore and the discontent here be deeper. But I will keep the secret Iwill treasure it up."_V.--Liberty--At a Price_While Mr. Baptist Hatton and Stephen Morley discussed the possiblerecovery of the papers much happened in London. Gerard became a markedman in the Chartist Convention a member of a small but resolute
comment532,committee. Egremont now deeply in love with Sybil declared his suit."From the first moment I beheld you in the starlit arch of Marney yourimage has never been absent from my consciousness. Do not reject mylove it is deep as your nature and fervent as my own. Banish thoseprejudices that have embittered your existence. If I be a noble I havenone of the accidents of nobility. I cannot offer you wealth splendourand power but I can offer you the devotion of an entranced beingaspirations that you shall guide an ambition that you shall govern.""These words are mystical and wild" said Sybil in amazement. "You areLord Marney's brother I learnt it but yesterday. Retain your hand andshare your life and fortunes You forget what I am. No no kindfriend--for such I'll call you--your opinion of me touches me deeply. Iam not used to such passages in life. A union between the child andbrother of nobles and a daughter of the people is impossible. It wouldmean estrangement from your family their hopes destroyed their prideoutraged. Believe me the gulf is impassable."The Chartist petition was rejected by the House of Commonscontemptuously. Riots took place in Birmingham. Sybil grew anxious forher father's safety.Egremont's speech in parliament on the presentation of the nationalpetition created some perplexity among his aristocratic relatives andacquaintances. It was free from the slang of faction--the voice of anoble who had upheld the popular cause who had pronounced that therights of labour were as sacred as those of property that the socialhappiness of the millions should be the statesman's first object.Sybil enjoying the calm of St. James's Park on a summer morning readthe speech with emotion and while she still held the paper the oratorhimself stood before her. She smiled without distress and presentlyconfided to Egremont that she was unhappy about her father."I honour your father" said Egremont "Counsel him to return to Mowbray.Exert every energy to get him to leave London at once--to-night ifpossible. After this business at Birmingham the government will strikeat the convention. If your father returns to Mowbray and is quiet hehas a chance of not being disturbed."Sybil returned and warned her father. "You are in danger" she cried"great and immediate. Let us quit this city to-night.""To-morrow my child" Walter Gerard assured her "we will return toMowbray. To-night our council meets and we have work of utmostimportance. We must discountenance scenes of violence. The moment our
comment533,council is over I will come back to you."But Walter Gerard did not return. While Sybil sat and waited StephenMorley entered the room. His manner was strange and unusual."Your father is in danger time is precious. I can endure no longer theanguish of my life. I love you and if you will not be mine I care forno one's fate. I can save your father. If I see him before eighto'clock I can convince him that the government knows of his intentionsand will arrest him to-night. I am ready to do this service--to save thefather from death and the daughter from despair if she would but onlysay to me 'I have but one reward and it is yours.'""It is bitter this" said Sybil "bitter for me and mine but for youpollution this bargaining of blood. In the name of the Holy Virgin Ianswer you--no"Morley rushed frantically from the room.Sybil in despair made her way to a coffee-house near Charing Crosswhich she knew had been much frequented by members of the ChartistConvention. Here after some delay she was given the fatal address inHunt Street Seven Dials.Sybil arrived at the meeting a few minutes before the police raided thepremises. She was found with her father and taken with him and sixother men to Bow Street Police Station. A note to Egremont procured herrelease in the early hours of the morning.Walter Gerard in due time was sent to trial convicted and sentenced toeighteen month's confinement in York Castle._VI.--Within the Castle Walls_In 1842 came the great stoppage of work. The mills ceased the minerswent "to play" despairing of a fair day's wage for a fair day's workand the inhabitants of Woodgate--the Hell-cats as they were called--stirred up by a Chartist delegate sallied forth with Simon Hattonnamed the "liberator" at their head to deal ruthlessly with all"oppressors of the people."They sacked houses plundered cellars ravaged provision shopsdestroyed gas-works and stormed workhouses. In time they came toMowbray. There the liberator came face to face with Baptist Hattonwithout recognising his brother.Stephen Morley and Baptist Hatton were in close conference."The times are critical" said Hatton."Mowbray may be burnt to the ground before the troops arrive" Morleyreplied."And the castle too" said Hatton quietly. "I was thinking onlyyesterday of a certain box of papers. To business friend Morley. Thissavage relative of mine cannot be quiet. If he does not destroyTrafford's Mill it will be the castle. Why not the castle instead of themill"Trafford's Mill was saved by the direct intervention of Walter Gerard.All the people of Mowbray knew the good reputation of the Traffords andGerard's eloquence turned the mob from the attack.While the liberator and the Hell-cats hesitated a man named Dandy Mickprompted by Morley urged that a walk should be taken in Lord deMowbray's park.The proposition was received with shouts of approbation. Gerardsucceeded in detaching a number of Mowbray men but the Hell-cats armedwith bludgeons poured into the park and on to the castle.Lady de Mowbray and her friends made their escape taking Sybil who hadsought refuge from the mob with them.Mr. St. Lys gathered a body of men in defence of the castle but cametoo late to prevent the entrance of the Hell-cats. Singularly enoughMorley and one or two of his followers entered with the liberator.The first great rush was to the cellars and the invaders were quicklyat work knocking off the heads of bottles and brandishing torches.Morley and his lads traced their way down a corridor to the windingsteps of the Round Tower and forced their way into the muniment room ofthe castle. It was not till his search had nearly been abandoned indespair that he found the small blue box blazoned with the arms ofValence. He passed it hastily to a trusted companion Dandy Mick andbade him deliver it to Sybil Gerard at the convent.At this moment the noise of musketry was heard the yeomanry were on thescene.Morley cut off from flight by the military was shot pistol in handwith the name of Sybil on his lips. "The world will misjudge me" he
comment534,thought--"they will call me hypocrite but the world is wrong."The man with the box escaped through the window and in spite of thefire troopers and mob reached the convent in safety.The castle was burnt to the ground by the torches of the Hell-cats.Sybil separated from her friends found herself surrounded by a band ofdrunken ruffians. She was rescued by a yeomanry officer who pressed herto his heart."Never to part again" said Egremont.Under Egremont's protection Sybil returned to the convent and there inthe courtyard they found Dandy Mick who had refused to deliver hischarge and was lying down with the blue box for his pillow. He hadfulfilled his mission. Sybil too agitated to perceive all its importdelivered the box into the custody of Egremont who bidding farewell toSybil bade Mick follow him to his hotel.While these events were happening Lord Marney hearing an alarmed andexaggerated report of the insurrection and believing that Egremont'sforces were by no means equal to the occasion had set out for Mowbraywith his own troop of yeomanry.Crossing the moor he encountered Walter Gerard with a great multitudewhom Gerard headed for purposes of peace.His mind inflamed and hating at all times any popular demonstrationLord Marney hastily read the Riot Act and the people were fired on andsabred. The indignant spirit of Gerard resisted and the father of Sybilwas shot dead. Instantly arose a groan and a feeling of frenzy cameover the people. Armed only with stones and bludgeons they defied thetroopers and rushed at the horsemen a shower of stones rattled withoutceasing on the helmet of Lord Marney nor did the people rest till LordMarney fell lifeless on Mowbray Moor stoned to death.The writ of right against Lord de Mowbray proved successful in thecourts and his lordship died of the blow.For a long time after the death of her father Sybil remained in helplesswoe. The widowed Lady Marney however came over one day and carriedher back to Marney Abbey never again to quit it until the bridal daywhen the Earl and Countess of Marney departed for Italy.Though the result was not what Mr. Hatton had once anticipated the ideathat he had deprived Sybil of her inheritance had ever since he hadbecome acquainted with her been the plague-spot of Hatton's life andthere was nothing he desired more than to see her restored to thoserights and to be instrumental in that restoration.Dandy Mick was rewarded for all the dangers he had encountered in theservice of Sybil and was set up in business by Lord Marney. A yearafter the burning of Mowbray Castle on the return of the Earl andCountess of Marney to England the romantic marriage and the enormouswealth of Lord and Lady Marney were still the talk in fashionablecircles.                                   Tancred or the New Crusade      "Tancred" published in 1847 completes the trilogy which     began with "Coningsby" in 1844 and had its second volume in     "Sybil" in 1845. In these three novels Disraeli gave to the     world his political social and religious philosophy.     "Coningsby" was mainly political "Sybil" mainly social and     in "Tancred" as the author tells us Disraeli dealt with the     origin of the Christian Church of England and its relation to     the Hebrew race whence Christianity sprang. "Public opinion     recognized the truth and sincerity of these views" although     their general spirit ran counter to current Liberal     utilitarianism. Although "Tancred" lacks the vigour of "Sibyl"     and the wit of "Coningsby" it is full of the colour of the     East and the satire and irony in the part relating to     Tancred's life in England are vastly entertaining. As in
comment535,     others of Disraeli's novels many of the characters here are     portraits of real personages._I.--Tancred Goes Forth on His Quest_Tancred the Marquis of Montacute was certainly strangely distracted onhis twenty-first birthday. He stood beside his father the Duke ofBellamont in the famous Crusaders' gallery in the Castle of Montacutelistening to the congratulations which the mayor and corporation ofMontacute town were addressing to him but all the time he kept his eyesfixed on the magnificent tapestries from which the name of the gallerywas derived. His namesake Tancred of Montacute had distinguishedhimself in the Third Crusade by saving the life of King Richard at thesiege of Ascalon and his exploits were depicted on the fine Gobelinswork hanging on the walls of the great hall. Oblivious of the gorgeousceremony in which he was playing the principal part the young Marquisof Montacute stared at the pictures of the Crusader and a wildfantastical idea took hold of him.He was the only child of the Duke of Bellamont and all the highnobility of England were assembled to celebrate his coming of age.Everything that fortune could bestow seemed to have been given to him.He was the heir of the greatest and richest of English dukes and hislife was made smooth and easy. His father had got a seat in parliamentwaiting for him and his mother had already selected a noble andbeautiful young lady for his wife. Neither of them had yet consultedtheir son but Tancred was so sweet and gentle a boy that they did notdream he would oppose their wishes. They had planned out his life forhim ever since he was born with the view to educating him for theposition which he was to occupy in the English aristocracy and he hadalways taken the path which they had chosen for him.In the evening the duke summoned his son into his library."My dear Tancred" he said "I have a piece of good news for you on yourbirthday. Hungerford feels that he cannot represent our constituency nowthat you have come of age and with great kindness he is resigning hisseat in your favour. He says that the Marquis of Montacute ought tostand for the town of Montacute so you will be able to enter parliamentat once.""But I do not wish to enter parliament" said Tancred.The duke leant back from his desk with a look of painful surprise on hisface."Not enter parliament" he exclaimed. "Every Lord Montacute has goneinto the House of Commons before taking his seat in the House of Lords.It is an excellent training.""I am not anxious to enter the House of Lords either" said Tancred."And I hope my dear father" he added with a smile that lit up hisyoung grave beautiful face "that it will be very very long before Isucceed to your place there.""What then do you intend to do my boy" said Bellamont in intense
comment536,perplexity. "You are the heir to one of the greatest positions in thestate and you have duties to perform. How are you going to fit yourselffor them""That is what I have been thinking of for years" said Tancred. "Oh mydear father if you knew how long and earnestly I have prayed forguidance Yes I have duties to perform But in this wild confused andaimless age of ours what man can see what his duties are For my partI cannot find that it is my duty to maintain the present order ofthings. In nothing in our religion our government our manners do Ifind faith. And if there is no faith how can there be any duty We haveceased to be a nation. We are a mere crowd kept from utter anarchy bythe remains of an old system which we are daily destroying.""But what would you do my dear boy" said the duke pale with anxiety."Have you found any remedy""No" said Tancred mournfully. "There is no remedy to be found inEngland. Oh let me save myself father Let me save our people from thecorruption and ruin that threaten us""But what do you want to do Where do you want to go" said the duke."I want to go to God" cried the young nobleman his blue eyes flamingwith a strange light "How is it that the Almighty Power does not senddown His angels to enlighten us in our perplexities Where is theParaclete the Comforter Who was promised us I must go and seek him.""You are a visionary my boy" said the duke gazing at him in blankastonishment."Was the Montacute that fought by the side of King Richard in the HolyLand a visionary" said Tancred. "All I ask is to be allowed to followin his footsteps. For three days and three nights he knelt in prayer atthe tomb of his Redeemer. Six centuries and more have gone by sincethen. It is high time that we renewed our intercourse with the Most Highin the country of His chosen people. I too would kneel at that tomb.I too surrounded by the holy hills and groves of Jerusalem would liftmy voice to Heaven and ask for inspiration.""But surely God will hear your prayers in England as well as inPalestine""No" said his son. "He has never raised up a prophet or a great saintin this country. If we want Him to speak to us as He spoke to the men ofold we must go like the Crusaders to the Holy Land."Finding that he could not turn his son from the strange course on whichhe was bent the duke got a great prelate to try and persuade him thatall was for the best in the best of all possible worlds."We live in an age of progress" reasoned the philosophic bishop."Religion is spreading with the spread of civilisation. How all our
comment537,towns are growing We shall soon see a bishop in Manchester.""I want to see an angel in Manchester" replied Tancred.It was no use arguing with a man who talked in this way and the dukegave Tancred permission to set out on his new crusade._II.--The Vigil by the Tomb_The moon sank behind the Mount of Olives leaving the towers minaretsand domes of Jerusalem in deep shadow the lamps in the city went outand every outline was lost in gloom but the Church of the HolySepulchre still shone in the darkness like a beacon light. There whileevery soul in Jerusalem slumbered Tancred knelt in prayer by the tombof Christ under the lighted dome waiting for the fire from heaven tostrike into his soul.His strange vigil was the talk of Syria. It is remarkable how quicklynews travels in the East."Do you know" said Besso Rothschild's agent to his foster-sonFakredeen an emir of Lebanon as they sat talking in a house near thegate of Sion "the young Englishman has brought me such a letter that ifhe were to tell me to rebuild Solomon's temple I must do it""He must be fabulously rich" said Fakredeen with a sigh. "What has hecome here for The English do not come on pilgrimages. They are allinfidels.""Well he has come on a pilgrimage" said Besso "and he is the greatestof English princes. He kneels all night and day in the church overthere."Yes after a week of solitude fasting and prayer Tancred was keepingvigil before the empty Sepulchre where Tancred of Montacute had kneltsix hundred years before. Day after day night after night he prayedfor inspiration but no divine voice broke in upon his impassionedreveries. It was for him that Alonzo Lara the prior of Terra Santakept the light burning all night long at the Holy Sepulchre for theSpaniard had been moved by the deep faith of the young English nobleman.And one day he said to him"Sinai led to Calvary. I think it would be wise for you to trace thepath backward from Calvary to Sinai."It was extremely perilous at that time to adventure into the greatdesert for the wild Bedouin tribes were encamped there. But in spiteof this Tancred made arrangements with an Arabian chief Sheikh Hassanand set out for Sinai at the head of a well-armed band of Arabs."Ah" said the sheikh as they entered the mountainous country after athree days' march across the wilderness. "Look at these tracks of horsesand camels in the defile. The marks are fresh. See that your guns areprimed" he cried to his men.As he spoke a troop of wild horsemen galloped down the ravine."Hassan" one of them shouted "is that the brother of the Queen of theEnglish with you Let him ride with us and you may return in peace.""He is my brother too" said Hassan. "Stand aside you sons of Eblisor you shall bite the earth."A wild shout from every height of the defile was the answer. Tancredlooked up. The crest on either side was lined with Bedouins each withhis musket levelled."There is only one thing for us to do" said Tancred to Hassan. "Let uscharge through the defile and die like men"Seizing his pistols he shot the first horseman through the head anddisabled another. Then he charged down the ravine and Hassan and hismen followed and scattered the horsemen before them. The Bedouins fireddown on them from the crests and in a few moments the place wasfilled with smoke and Tancred could not see a yard around him. Still hegalloped on and the smoke suddenly drifted and he found himself at themouth of the defile with a few followers behind him. A crowd ofBedouins were waiting for him."Die fighting Die fighting" he shouted. Then his horse stumbledstabbed from beneath by a Bedouin dagger and fell in the sand. Beforehe could get his feet out of the stirrups he was overpowered and bound."Don't hurt him" said the Bedouin chief. "Every drop of his blood is
comment538,worth ten thousand piastres."Late that night as Amalek the great Rechabite Bedouin sheikh wassitting before his tent a horseman rode up to him."Salaam" he cried. "Sheikh of sheikhs it is done The brother of theQueen of England is your slave""Good" said Amalek. "May your mother eat the hump of a young camel Isthe brother of the queen with Sheikh Salem""No" said the horseman "Sheikh Salem is in paradise and many of ourmen are with him. The brother of the Queen of the English is a mightywarrior. He fought like a lion but we brought his horse down at lastand took him alive.""Good" said Amalek. "Camels shall be given to all the widows of the menhe has killed and I will find them new husbands. Go and tell Fakredeenthe good news"Amalek and Fakredeen would not have cared had they lost a hundred men inthe affair. The Bedouin chief and the emir of Lebanon could bring intothe field more than twenty thousand lances and the capture of Tancredwas part of a political scheme which they were engineering for theconquest of Syria. They knew from Besso that the young English princewas fabulously rich and as they wanted arms they meant to hold him tothe extraordinary ransom of two million piastres."My foster father will pay it" said Fakredeen. "He told me that hewould have to rebuild Solomon's temple if the English prince asked himto. We will get him to help us rebuild Solomon's empire."_III.--The Vision on the Mount_On the wild granite scarp of Mount Sinai about seven thousand feetabove the blue seas that lave its base is a small plain hemmed in bypinnacles of rock. In the centre of the plain are a cypress tree and afountain. This is the traditional scene of the greatest event in thehistory of mankind. It was here that Moses received the divine laws onwhich the civilisation of the world is based.Tancred of Montacute knelt down on the sacred soil and bowed his headin prayer. Far below him in one of the green-valleys sloping down tothe sea Fakredeen and a band of Bedouins pitched their tents for thenight and talked in awed tones of their strange companion. Wonderful isthe power of soul with which a great idea endues a man. The young emirof Lebanon and his men were no longer the captors of Tancred but hisfollowers. He had preached to them with the eyes of flame and the wordsof fire of a prophet and they now asked of him not a ransom but arevelation. They wanted him to bring down from Sinai the new word ofpower which would bind their scattered tribes into a mighty nationwith a divine mission for all the world.What was this word to be Tancred did not know any more than hisfollowers and he knelt all day long under the Arabian sun waiting forthe divine revelation. The sunlight faded and the shadows fell aroundhim and he still remained bowed in a strange quiet ecstasy ofexpectation. But at last lifting up his eyes to the clear starry skyof Arabia he prayed"O Lord God of Israel I come to Thine ancient dwelling-place to pourforth the heart of tortured Europe. Why does no impulse from Thyrenovating will strike again into the soul of man Faith fades and dutydies and a profound melancholy falls upon the world. Our kings cannotrule our priests doubt and our multitudes toil and moan and call intheir madness upon unknown gods. If this transfigured mount may notagain behold Thee if Thou wilt not again descend to teach and consoleus send oh send one of the starry messengers that guard Thy throneto save Thy creatures from their terrible despair"
comment539,As he prayed all the stars of Arabia grew strangely dim. The wild peaksof Sinai standing sharp and black in the lucid purple air melted intoshadowy changing masses. The huge branches of the cypress-tree movedmysteriously above his head and he fell upon the earth senseless and ina trance.It seemed to Tancred that a mighty form was bending over him with acountenance like an oriental night dark yet lustrous mystical yetclear. The solemn eyes of the shadowy apparition were full of thebrightness and energy of youth and the calm wisdom of the ages."I am the Angel of Arabia" said the spectral figure waving a sceptrefashioned like a palm-tree "the guardian spirit of the land whichgoverns the world for its power lies neither in the sword nor in theshield for these pass away but in ideas which are divine. All thethoughts of every nation come from a higher power than man but thethoughts of Arabia come directly from the Most High. You want a newrevelation to Christendom Listen to the ancient message of Arabia"Your people now hanker after other gods than the God of Sinai andCalvary. But the eternal principles of that Arabian faith which mouldedthem from savages into civilised men when they descended from theirnorthern forests fifteen hundred years ago and spread all over theworld can alone breathe new vigour into them now that they aredecaying in the dust and fever of their great cities. Tell them thatthey must cease from seeking in their vain philosophies for the solutionof their social problems. Their longing for the brotherhood of mankindcan only be satisfied when they acknowledge the sway of a common father.Tell them that they are the children of God. Announce the sublime andsolacing doctrine of theocratic equality. Fear not falter not. Obey theimpulse of thine own spirit and find a ready instrument in every humanbeing."A sound as of thunder roused Tancred from his trance. Above him themountains rose sharp and black in the clear purple air and the Arabianstars shone with undimmed brightness but the voice of the angel stilllingered in his ear. He went down the mountain at its base he found hisfollowers sleeping amid their camels. He aroused Fakredeen and told himthat he had received the word which would bind together the warringnations of Arabia and Palestine and reshape the earth._IV.--The Mystic Queen_"It has been a great day" said Tancred to Fakredeen as they weresitting some months afterwards in the castle of the young emir ofLebanon where all the princes of Syria had assembled to discuss thefoundation of the new empire. "If your friends will only work together
comment540,as they promise Syria is ours.""Even Lebanon" said Fakredeen "can send forth more than fifty thousandwell-armed footmen and Amalek is gathering all the horsemen of thedesert from Petraea to Yemen under our banner. If we can only win overthe Ansarey" he continued "we shall have all Syria and Arabia as abase for our operations.""The Ansarey" exclaimed Tancred. "They hold the mountains aroundAntioch which are the key of Palestine don't they What is theirreligion Do you think that the doctrine of theocratic equality wouldappeal to them as it did to the Arabians""I don't know" said the emir. "They never allow strangers to entertheir country. They are a very ancient people and they fight so well intheir mountains that even the Turks have not been able to conquer them.""But can't we make overtures" said Tancred."That is what I have done" said Fakredeen. "The Queen of the Ansareyhas heard about you and I have arranged that we should go and see heras soon as the Syrian assembly was over. Everything is ready for ourjourney so if you like we will start at once."It was a difficult expedition as the Queen of the Ansarey was thenwaging war on the Turkish pasha of Aleppo. Happily the travellers cameupon a band of Ansareys who were raiding the Turkish province and wereled by them through their black ravines to the fortress palace of thequeen.She received them sitting on her divan clothed in a purple robe andshrouded in a long veil. This she took off when Tancred came towardsher and he marvelled at the strangeness of her beauty. There wasnothing oriental about her. She was a Greek girl of the ancient typewith violet eyes fair cheeks and dark hair."Prince" she said "we are a people who wish neither to see nor to beseen. We do not care what goes on in the world around. Our mountains arewild and barren but while Apollo dwells among us we do not care forgold or silk or jewels.""Apollo" cried Tancred. "Are the gods of Olympus still worshipped onearth""Yes Apollo still lives among us and another greater than Apollo"said the young queen looking at Tancred long and earnestly. "Follow meand you shall now behold the secret of the Ansarey."Her maidens adorned her with a garland of roses and put a garland onthe head of Tancred and she led him through a portal of bronze down anunderground passage into an Ionic temple filled with the white andlovely forms of the gods of ancient Greece."Do you know this" said the queen to Tancred looking at a statue ingolden ivory and then at the young Englishman whose clear-cut featuresand hyacinthine locks curiously resembled those of the carven image."It is Phoebus Apollo" said Tancred and moved by admiration at thebeauty of the figure he murmured some lines of Homer."Ah you know all" cried the queen. "You know our secret language. Yesthis is Phoebus Apollo. He used to stand in Antioch in the ancient daysbefore the Christians drove us into the mountains. And look" she saidpointing to the statue beside Apollo "here is the Syrian goddess beforewhom the pilgrims of the world once knelt. She is named Astarte and Iam called after her.""Oh angels watch over me" said Tancred to himself as Queen Astartefixed her violet eyes upon him with a glance of love that could not bemistaken and led him back into the hall of audience.There he saw Fakredeen bending over a maiden with a flower-like faceand large dark lustrous eyes."She is my foster-sister Eva" said Fakredeen. "The Ansareys capturedher on the plain of Aleppo."Tancred had met Eva at the house of Besso in Jerusalem but she did notthen exercise over him the strange charm which now drew him to her side.It seemed to him that the beautiful Jewish girl had been sent to help
comment541,him in his struggle against the heathen spells of Astarte. As he wasmeditating how he could rescue her a messenger came in and announcedthat the pasha of Aleppo had invaded the mountains at the head of 5000troops."Ah" cried Astarte. "Few of them will ever see Aleppo again. I have25000 men under arms and you my prince" she said turning toTancred "shall command them."Tancred had learnt something of the arts of mountain warfare from SheikhAmalek. He allowed the Turkish troops to penetrate into the heart of thewild hills and then as they were marching down a long defile heattacked them from the crests above shooting them down like sheep andburying them in avalanches of rolling rock. Instead of returning to thefortress palace he sent his men on ahead and rode out alone into thedesert and went through the Syrian wilderness back to Jerusalem.Riding up to the door of Besso's house by Sion gate he asked if therewere any news of Eva. A negro led him into a garden and there sittingby the side of a fountain was the lovely Jewish maiden."So Fakredeen brought you safely away Eva" he said tenderly. "I wasafraid that Astarte meant to harm you.""She would have killed me" said Eva "if she could. I am afraid thatyour faith in your idea of theocratic equality has been destroyed by theAnsareys. How can you build up an empire in a land divided by so manyjarring creeds Do you still believe in Arabia""I believe in Arabia" cried Tancred kneeling down at her feet"because I believe in you. You are the angel of Arabia and the angel ofmy life. You cannot guess what influence you have had on my fate. Youcame into my life like another messenger from God. Thanks to you myfaith has never faltered. Will you not share it dearest"He clasped her hand and gazed with passionate adoration into her face.As her head fell upon his shoulder the negro came running to thefountain."The Duke of Bellamont" he said to Tancred.Tancred looked up and saw the Duke of Bellamont coming through thepomegranate trees of the garden."Father" he said advancing towards the duke "I have found my missionin life and I am going to marry this lady."                                   ALEXANDRE DUMASMarguerite de Valois      Alexandre Dumas _pre_ to distinguish him from his son of     the same name early became known as a talented writer and     especially as a poet and dramatist. His first published work     appeared in 1823 then came volumes of poems in 1825 1826     and the drama of "Henry III." in 1828. In "Marguerite de
comment542,     Valois" published in 1845 the first of the "Valois" series     of historical romances Dumas takes us back from the days of     Richelieu and the "Three Musketeers" to the preceding century     and the early struggles of Catholic and Huguenot. It was a     stirring time in France full of horrors and bloodshed plots     and intrigues when Marguerite de Valois married Henry of     Navarre and Alexandre Dumas gives us in his wonderfully     vivid and attractive style a great picture of the French     court in the time of Charles IX. Little affection existed     between Henry and his bride but strong ties of interest and     ambition bound them together and for a long time they both     adhered loyally to the treaty of political alliance they had     drawn up for their mutual advantage. Dumas died on December 5     1870 after experiencing many changes of fortune. His son also     won considerable reputation as a dramatist and novelist._I.--Henry of Navarre and Marguerite_On Monday August 18 1572 a great festival was held in the palace ofthe Louvre. It was to celebrate the marriage of Henry of Navarre andMarguerite de Valois a marriage that perplexed a good many people andalarmed others.For Henry de Bourbon King of Navarre was the leader of the Huguenotparty and Marguerite was the daughter of Catherine de Medici and thesister of the king Charles IX. and this alliance between a Protestantand a Catholic it seemed was to end the strife that rent the nation.The king too had set his heart on this marriage and the Huguenotswere somewhat reassured by the king's declaration that Catholic andHuguenot alike were now his subjects and were equally beloved by him.Still there were many on both sides who feared and distrusted thealliance.At midnight six days later on August 24 the tocsin sounded and themassacre of St. Bartholomew began.The marriage indeed was in no sense a love match but Henry succeededat once in making Marguerite his friend for he was alive to the dangersthat surrounded him."Madame" he said presenting himself at Marguerite's rooms on the nightof the wedding festival "whatever many persons may have said I thinkour marriage is a good marriage. I stand well with you--you stand well
comment543,with me. Therefore we ought to act towards each other like good alliessince to-day we have been allied in the sight of God Don't you thinkso""Without question sir""I know madame that the ground at court is full of dangerous abyssesand I know that though I am young and have never injured any person Ihave many enemies. The king hates me his brothers the Duke of Anjouand the Duke D'Alenon hate me. Catherine de Medici hated my mother toomuch not to hate me. Well against these menaces which must soon becomeattacks I can only defend myself by your aid for you are beloved byall those who hate me""I" said Marguerite."Yes you" replied Henry. "And if you will--I do not say love me--butif you will be my ally I can brave anything while if you become myenemy I am lost.""Your enemy Never sir" exclaimed Marguerite."And my ally.""Most decidedly"And Marguerite turned round and presented her hand to the king. "It isagreed" she said."Political alliance frank and loyal" asked Henry."Frank and loyal" was the answer.At the door Henry turned and said softly "Thanks Marguerite thanksYou are a true daughter of France. Lacking your love your friendshipwill not fail me. I rely on you as you for your part may rely on me.Adieu madame."He kissed his wife's hand and then with a quick step the king wentdown the corridor to his own apartment. "I have more need of fidelity inpolitics than in love" he said to himself.If on both sides there was little attempt at fidelity in love there wasan honourable alliance which was maintained unbroken and saved the lifeof Henry of Navarre from his enemies on more than one occasion.On the day of the St. Bartholomew massacre while the Huguenots werebeing murdered throughout Paris Charles IX. instigated by his mothersummoned Henry of Navarre to the royal armoury and called upon him toturn Catholic or die."Will you kill me sire--me your brother-in-law" exclaimed Henry.Charles IX. turned away to the open window. "I must kill someone" hecried and firing his arquebuse struck a man who was passing.Then animated by a murderous fury Charles loaded and fired hisarquebuse without stopping shouting with joy when his aim wassuccessful."It's all over with me" said Henry to himself. "When he sees no oneelse to kill he will kill me"Catherine de Medici entered as the king fired his last shot. "Is itdone" she said anxiously."No" the king exclaimed throwing his arquebuse on the floor. "No theobstinate blockhead will not consent"Catherine gave a glance at Henry which Charles understood perfectly andwhich said "Why then is he alive""He lives" said the king "because he is my relative."Henry felt that it was with Catherine he had to contend."Madame" he said addressing her "I can see quite clearly that allthis comes from you and not from brother-in-law Charles. It was you whoplanned this massacre to ensnare me into a trap which was to destroy usall. It was you who made your daughter the bait. It has been you whohave separated me now from my wife that she might not see me killedbefore her eyes""Yes but that shall not be" cried another voice and Margueritebreathless and impassioned burst into the room."Sir" said Marguerite to Henry "your last words were an accusationand were both right and wrong. They have made me the means for
comment544,attempting to destroy you but I was ignorant that in marrying me youwere going to destruction. I myself owe my life to chance for this verynight they all but killed me in seeking you. Directly I knew of yourdanger I sought you. If you are exiled sir I will be exiled too ifthey imprison you they shall imprison me also if they kill you I willalso die"She gave her hand to her husband and he seized it eagerly."Brother" cried Marguerite to Charles IX. "remember you made him myhusband""Faith Margot is right and Henry is my brother-in-law" said the king._II.--The Boar Hunt_As time went on if Catherine's hatred of Henry of Navarre did notdiminish Charles IX. certainly became more friendly.Catherine was for ever intriguing and plotting for the fortune of hersons and the downfall of her son-in-law but Henry always managed toevade the webs she wove. At a certain boar-hunt Charles was indebted toHenry for his life.It was at the time when the king's brother D'Anjou had accepted thecrown of Poland and the second brother D'Alenon a weak-mindedambitious man was secretly hoping for a crown somewhere that Henrypaid his debt for the king's mercy to him on the night of St.Bartholomew.Charles was an intrepid hunter but the boar had swerved as the king'sspear was aimed at him and maddened with rage the animal had rushedat him. Charles tried to draw his hunting-knife but the sheath was sotight it was impossible."The boar the boar" shouted the king. "Help D'Alenon help"D'Alenon was ghastly white as he placed his arquebuse to his shoulderand fired. The ball instead of hitting the boar felled the king'shorse."I think" D'Alenon murmured to himself "that D'Anjou is King ofFrance and I King of Poland."The boar's tusk had indeed grazed the king's thigh when a hand in aniron glove dashed itself against the mouth of the beast and a knife wasplunged into its shoulder.Charles rose with difficulty and seemed for a moment as if about tofall by the dead boar. Then he looked at Henry of Navarre and for thefirst time in four-and-twenty years his heart was touched."Thanks Harry" he said. "D'Alenon for a first-rate marksman you madea most curious shot."On Marguerite coming up to congratulate the king and thank her husbandCharles added "Margot you may well thank him. But for him Henry III.would be King of France.""Alas madame" returned Henry "M. D'Anjou who is always my enemywill now hate me more than ever but everyone has to do what he can."Had Charles IX. been killed the Duke d'Anjou would have been King ofFrance and D'Alenon most probably King of Poland. Henry of Navarrewould have gained nothing by this change of affairs.Instead of Charles IX. who tolerated him he would have had the Duked'Anjou on the throne who being absolutely at one with his motherCatherine had sworn his death and would have kept his oath.These ideas were in his brain when the wild boar rushed on Charles andlike lightning he saw that his own existence was bound up with the lifeof Charles IX. But the king knew nothing of the spring and motive of thedevotion which had saved his life and on the following day he showedhis gratitude to Henry by carrying him off from his apartments and outof the Louvre. Catherine in her fear lest Henry of Navarre should besome day King of France had arranged the assassination of her son-in-law and Charles getting wind of this warned him that the air of theLouvre was not good for him that night and kept him in his company.Instead of Henry it was one of his followers who was killed._III.--The Poisoned Book_Once more Catherine resolved to destroy Henry. The Huguenots had plottedwith D'Alenon that he should be King of Navarre since Henry not onlyabjured Protestantism but remained in Paris being kept there indeed bythe will of Charles IX.Catherine aware of D'Alenon's scheme assured her son that Henry wassuffering from an incurable disease and must be taken away from Paris
comment545,when D'Alenon started for Navarre."Are you sure that Henry will die" asked D'Alenon."The physician who gave me a certain book assured me of it.""And where is this book What is it"Catherine brought the book from her cabinet."Here it is. It is a treatise on the art of rearing and training falconsby an Italian. Give it to Henry who is going hawking with the kingto-day and will not fail to read it.""I dare not" said D'Alenon shuddering."Nonsense" replied Catherine. "It is a book like any other only theleaves have a way of sticking together. Don't attempt to read ityourself for you will have to wet the finger in turning over each leafwhich takes up so much time.""Oh" said D'Alenon "Henry is with the court Give me the book andwhile he is away I will put it in his room."D'Alenon's hand was trembling as he took the book from thequeen-mother and with some hesitation and fear he entered Henry'sapartment and placed the volume open at the title-page.But it was not Henry but Charles seeking his brother-in-law who foundthe book and carried it off to his own room. D'Alenon found the kingreading."By heavens this is an admirable book" cried Charles. "Only it seemsas if they had stuck the leaves together on purpose to conceal thewonders it contains."D'Alenon's first thought was to snatch the book from his brother buthe hesitated.The king again moistened his finger and turned over a page. "Let mefinish this chapter" he said "and then tell me what you please. I havealready read fifty pages.""He must have tasted the poison five-and-twenty times" thoughtD'Alenon. "He is a dead man"The poison did its deadly work. Charles was taken ill while out huntingand returned to find his dog dead and in its mouth pieces of paper fromthe precious book on falconry. The king turned pale. The book waspoisoned Many things flashed across his memory and he knew his lifewas doomed.Charles summoned Ren a Florentine the court perfumer to Catherine deMedici to his presence and bade him examine the dog."Sire" said Ren after a close investigation "the dog has beenpoisoned by arsenic.""He has eaten a leaf of this book" said Charles "and if you do nottell me whose book it is I will have your flesh torn from your bones byred-hot pincers.""Sire" stammered the Florentine "this book belongs to me""And how did it leave your hands""Her majesty the queen-mother took it from my house.""Why did she do that""I believe she intended sending it to the King of Navarre who had askedfor a book on hawking.""Ah" said Charles "I understand it all The book was in Harry's room.It is destiny I must yield to it. Tell me" he went on turning toRen "this poison does not always kill at once"
comment546,"No sire but it kills surely. It is a matter of time.""Is there no remedy""None sire unless it be instantly administered."Charles compelled the wretched man to write in the fatal volume "Thisbook was given by me to the queen-mother Catherine de Medici.--Ren"and then dismissed him.Henry at his own prayer and for his personal safety was confined inthe prison of Vincennes by the king's order. Charles grew worse and thephysicians discussed his malady without daring to guess at the truth.Then Catherine came one day and explained to the king the cause of hisdisease."Listen my son you believe in magic""Oh fully" said Charles repressing his smile of incredulity."Well" continued Catherine "all your sufferings proceed from magic. Anenemy afraid to attack you openly has done so in secret a terribleconspiracy has been directed against your majesty. You doubt itperhaps but I know it for a certainty.""I never doubt what you tell me" replied the king sarcastically. "I amcurious to know how they have sought to kill me.""By magic. Look here." The queen drew from under her mantle a figure ofyellow wax about ten inches high wearing a robe covered with goldenstars and over this a royal mantle."See it has on its head a crown" said Catherine "and there is aneedle in its heart. Now do you recognise yourself""Myself""Yes in your royal robes with the crown on your head.""And who made this figure" asked-the king weary of the wretched farce."The King of Navarre of course""No sire he did not actually make it but it was found in the rooms ofM. de la Mole who serves the King of Navarre.""So then the person who seeks to kill me is M. de la Mole" saidCharles."He is only the instrument and behind the instrument is the hand thatdirects it" replied Catherine."This then is the cause of my illness. And now what must I do--for Iknow nothing of sorcery""The death of the conspirator destroys the charm. Its power ends withhis life. You are convinced now are you not of the cause of yourillness""Oh certainly" Charles answered ironically. "And I am to punish M. dela Mole as you say he is the guilty party""I say he is the instrument and" muttered Catherine "we haveinfallible means for making him confess the name of his principal."Catherine left hurriedly without understanding the sardonic laughter ofthe king and as she went out Marguerite appeared."Oh sire--sire" cried Marguerite "you know what _she_ says is false.It is terrible to accuse anyone's own mother but she only lives topersecute the man who is devoted to you Henry--your Henry--and I swearto you that what she says is false""I think so too Margot. But Henry is safe. Safer in disgrace inVincennes than in favour at the Louvre.""Oh thanks thanks But there is another person in whose welfare I aminterested whom I hardly dare mention to my brother much less to myking.""M. de la Mole is it not But do you know that a figure dressed inroyal robes and pierced to the heart was found in his rooms""I know it but it was the figure of a woman not of a man.""And the needle""Was a charm not to kill a man but to make a woman love him.""What was the name of this woman""Marguerite" cried the queen throwing herself down and bathing theking's hand in her tears."Margot what if I know the real author of the crime For a crime hasbeen committed and I have not three months to live. I am poisoned butit must be thought I die by magic.""You know who is guilty"
comment547,"Yes but it must be kept from the world and so it must be believed Idie of magic and by the agency of him they accuse.""But it is monstrous" exclaimed Marguerite. "You know he is innocent.Pardon him--pardon him""I know it but the world must believe him guilty. Let your friend die.His death alone can save the honour of our family. I am dying that thesecret may be preserved."M. de la Mole after enduring excruciating tortures at the hand ofCatherine without making any admissions died on the scaffold._IV--"The Bourbon Shall Not Reign_"Before he died Charles showed Catherine the poisoned book which he hadkept under lock and key."And now burn it madame. I read this book too much so fond was I ofthe chase. And the world must not know the weaknesses of kings. When itis burnt please summon my brother Henry. I wish to speak to him aboutthe regency."Catherine brought Henry of Navarre to the king and warned him that ifhe accepted the regency he was a dead man.Charles however though on his death-bed declared Henry should beregent."Madame" he said addressing his mother "if I had a son he would beking and you would be regent. In your stead did you decline the Kingof Poland would be regent and in his stead D'Alenon. But I have noson and therefore the throne belongs to D'Anjou who is absent. To makeD'Alenon regent is to invite civil war. I have therefore chosen thefittest person for regent Salute him madame salute him D'Alenon. Itis the King of Navarre""Never" cried Catherine "shall my race yield to a foreign one Nevershall a Bourbon reign while a Valois lives"She left the room followed by D'Alenon."Henry" said Charles "after my death you will be great and powerful.D'Anjou will not leave Poland--they will not let him. D'Alenon is atraitor. You alone are capable of governing. It is not the regency onlybut the throne I give you."A stream of blood choked his speech."The fatal moment is come" said Henry. "Am I to reign or to live""Live sire" a voice answered and Ren appeared. "The queen has sentme to ruin you but I have faith in your star. It is foretold that youshall be king. Do you know that the King of Poland will be here verysoon He has been summoned by the queen. A messenger has come fromWarsaw. You shall be king but not yet.""What shall I do then""Fly instantly to where your friends wait for you."
comment548,Henry stooped and kissed his brother's forehead then disappeared down asecret passage passed through the postern and springing on his horsegalloped off."He flies The King of Navarre flies" cried the sentinels."Fire on him Fire" said the queen.The sentinels levelled their pieces but the king was out of reach."He flies" muttered D'Alenon. "I am king then"At the same moment the drawbridge was hastily lowered and Henry d'Anjougalloped into the court followed by four knights crying "FranceFrance""My son" cried Catherine joyfully."Am I too late" said D'Anjou."No. You are just in time. Listen"The captain of the king's guards appeared at the balcony of the king'sapartment. He broke the wand he held in two places and holding a piecein either hand called out three times "King Charles the Ninth isdead"King Charles the Ninth is dead King Charles the Ninth is dead""Charles the Ninth is dead" said Catherine crossing herself. "God saveHenry the Third"All repeated the cry."I have conquered" said Catherine "and the odious Bourbon shall notreign"                                   The Black Tulip      "The Black Tulip" published in 1850 was the last of     Alexandre Dumas' more famous stories and ranks deservedly     high among the short novels of its prolific author. Dumas     visited Holland in May 1849 in order to be present at the     coronation of William III. at Amsterdam and according to     Flotow the composer it was the king himself who told Dumas     the story of "The Black Tulip" and mentioned that none of the     author's romances were concerned with the Dutch. Dumas     however never gave any credit to this anecdote and others     have alleged that Paul Lacroix the bibliophile who was     assisting Dumas with his novels at that time is responsible     for the plot. The question can never be answered for who can     disentangle the work of Dumas from that of his army of     helpers A feature of "The Black Tulip" is that in it is the     bulb and not a human being that is the real centre of     interest. The fate of the bulb is made of first importance     and the fortunes of Cornelius van Baerle the tulip fancier     of Boxtel and of Rosa the gaoler's daughter exciting though     they are take second place._I.--Mob Vengeance_On the 20th of August 1672 the city of The Hague was crowded in everystreet with a mob of people all armed with knives muskets or sticksand all hurrying towards the Buytenhof.Within that terrible prison was Cornelius de Witt brother of John deWitt the ex-Grand Pensionary of Holland.These brothers De Witt had long served the United Provinces of the DutchRepublic and the people had grown tired of the Republic and wantedWilliam Prince of Orange for Stadtholder. John de Witt had signed theAct re-establishing the Stadtholderate but Cornelius had only signed itunder the compulsion of an Orange mob that attacked his house atDordrecht.This was the first count against the De Witts--their objection to aStadtholder. The second count was that the De Witts had always donetheir best to keep at peace with France. They knew that war with Francemeant ruin to Holland but the more violent Orangists still believedthat such a war would bring honour to the Dutch.Hence the popular hatred against the De Witts. A miscreant namedTyckelaer fanned the flame against Cornelius by declaring that he hadbribed him to assassinate William the newly-elected Stadtholder.
comment549,Cornelius was arrested brought to trial and tortured on the rack butno confession of guilt could be wrung from the innocent high-souledman. Then the judges acquitted Tyckelaer deprived Cornelius of all hisoffices and passed sentence of banishment. John de Witt had alreadyresigned the office of Grand Pensionary.On the 20th of August Cornelius was to leave his prison for exile anda fierce Orangist populace incited to violence by the harangues ofTyckelaer was rushing to the Buytenhof prepared to do murder andfearful lest the prisoner should escape alive. "To the gaol To thegaol" yelled the mob. But outside the prison was a line of cavalrydrawn up under the command of Captain Tilly with orders to guard theBuytenhof and while the populace stood in hesitation not daring toattack the soldiers John de Witt had quietly driven up to the prisonand had been admitted by the gaoler.The shouts and clamour of the people could be heard within the prison asJohn de Witt accompanied by Gryphus the gaoler made his way to hisbrother's cell.Cornelius learnt there was no time to be lost but there was a questionof certain correspondence between John de Witt and M. de Louvois ofFrance to be discussed. These letters entirely creditable though theywere to the statesmanship of the Grand Pensionary would have beenaccepted as evidence of treason by the maddened Orangists andCornelius instead of burning them had left them in the keeping of hisgodson Van Baerle a quiet scholarly young man of Dordrecht who wasutterly unaware of the nature of the packet."They will kill us if these papers are found" said John de Witt andopening the window they heard the mob shouting "Death to traitors"In spite of fingers and wrists broken by the rack Cornelius managed towrite a note.      DEAR GODSON Burn the packet I gave you burn without opening     or looking at it so that you may not know the contents. The     secrets it contains bring death. Burn it and you will have     saved both John and Cornelius.     Farewell from your affectionate     CORNELIUS DE WITT.Then a letter was given to Craeke John de Witt's faithful servant whoat once set off for Dordrecht and within a few minutes the two brotherswere driving away to the city gate. Rosa the gaoler's daughter unknownto her father had opened the postern and had herself bidden De Witt'scoachman drive round to the rear of the prison and by this means thefury of the mob was for the moment evaded.And now the clamour of the Orangists was at the prison door for Tilly'shorse had withdrawn on an order signed by the deputies in the town halland the people were raging to get within the Buytenhof.The mob burst open the great gate and yelling "Death to the traitorsTo the gallows with Cornelius de Witt" poured in only to find theprisoner had escaped. But the escape was but from the prison for thecity gate was locked when the carriage of the De Witts drove up lockedby order of the deputies of the Town Hall and a certain young man--whowas none other than William Prince of Orange--held the key.Before another gate could be reached the mob streaming from theBuytenhof had overtaken the carriage and the De Witts were at itsmercy.The two men whose lives had been spent in the welfare of their countrywere massacred with unspeakable savagery and their bodies strippedand hacked almost beyond recognition were then strung up on a hastilyerected gibbet in the market-place.When the worst had been done the young man who had secretly watchedthe proceedings from the window of a neighbouring house returned the
comment550,key to the gatekeeper.Then the prince mounted a horse which an equerry held in waiting forhim and galloped off to camp to await the message of the States. Hegalloped proudly for the burghers of The Hague had made of the corpsesof the De Witts a stepping stone to power for William of Orange._II.--Betrayed for his Bulbs_Doctor Cornelius van Baerle the godson of Cornelius de Witt was in histwenty-eighth year an orphan but nevertheless a really happy man. Hisfather had amassed a fortune of 400000 guilders in trade with theIndies and an estate brought him in 10000 guilders a year. He wasblessed with the love of a peaceful life with good nerves ample wealthand a philosophic mind.Left alone in the big house at Dordrecht he steadily resisted alltemptations to public life. He took up the study of botany and thennot knowing what to do with his time and money decided to go in for oneof the most extravagant hobbies of the time--the cultivation of hisfavourite flower the tulip. The fame of Mynheer van Baerle's tulipssoon spread in the district and while Cornelius de Witt had rouseddeadly hatred by sowing the seeds of political passion Van Baerle withhis tulips won general goodwill. Yet all unknowingly Van Baerle hadmade an enemy an implacable relentless enemy. This was his neighbourIsaac Boxtel who lived next door to him in Dordrecht.Boxtel from childhood had been a passionate tulip-grower. He had evenproduced a tulip of his own and the Boxtel had won wide admiration. Oneday to his horror Boxtel discovered that his next-door neighbour thewealthy Mynheer van Baerle was also a tulip-grower. In bitter anguishBoxtel foresaw that he had a rival who with all the resources at hiscommand might equal and possibly surpass the famous Boxtel creations.He almost choked with envy and from the moment of his discovery livedunder continual fear. The healthy pastime of tulip growing became underthese conditions a morbid and evil occupation for Boxtel while VanBaerle on the other hand totally unaware of the enmity brewing threwhimself into the business with the keenest zest taking for his mottothe old aphorism "To despise flowers is to insult God."So fierce was the envy that seized Boxtel that though he would haveshrunk from the infamy of destroying a tulip he would have killed theman who grew them. His own plants were neglected it was useless andhopeless to contend against so wealthy a rival. Then Boxtel fascinatedby his evil passion bought a telescope and perched on a ladderstudied Van Baerle's tulip beds and the drying-room the tulip-grower'ssacred place.One night he lost all moral control and tying the hind legs of two catstogether with a piece of string he flung the animals into Van Baerle'sgarden. To Boxtel's bitter mortification the cats though they madehavoc of many precious plants before they broke the string left thefour finest tulips untouched.Shortly afterwards the Haarlem Tulip Society offered a prize of 100000guilders to whomsoever should produce a large black tulip without spotor blemish. Van Baerle at once thought out the idea of the black tulip.He had already achieved a dark brown one while Boxtel who had onlymanaged to produce a light brown one gave up the quest as impossibleand could do nothing but spy on his neighbour's activities.One evening in January 1672 Cornelius de Witt came to see his grandsonCornelius van Baerle and went with him alone into the sacred drying-room the laboratory of the tulip-grower. Boxtel with his telescoperecognised the well-known features of the statesman and presently hesaw him hand his godson a packet which the latter put carefully away ina cabinet. This packet contained the correspondence of John de Witt andM. de Louvois.
comment551,Cornelius drove away and Boxtel wondered what the packet contained. Itcould hardly be bulbs it must be secret papers.It was not till August as we know that Craeke was despatched to VanBaerle with the note bidding him destroy the packet.Craeke arrived just when Van Baerle was nursing his precious bulbs--thebulbs of the black tulip--and his sudden entrance rudely disturbed thetulip-grower. He had not time to read the note indeed he was too muchconcerned with the welfare of his three particular bulbs to troubleabout it before a magistrate and some soldiers entered to arrest him.Van Baerle wrapped up the bulbs in the note from his godfather and wassent off under close custody to The Hague. The magistrate carried offthe packet from the cabinet.All this was Boxtel's work. It was he who had reported to the magistratethe visit of De Witt and the placing of the packet in a cabinet. Andnow with Van Baerle out of the house as a prisoner Boxtel in the deadof night broke into his neighbour's house to secure the priceless bulbsof the black tulip. He had made out where they were growing and heplunged his hands into the soft soil--only to find nothing. Then thewretched man guessed that the bulbs had gone with the prisoner to TheHague and decided to go in pursuit. Van Baerle could only keep themwhile he was alive and then--they should be his Isaac Boxtel's._III.--The Theft of the Tulip_Van Baerle was placed in the cell occupied by Cornelius de Witt in theBuytenhof. Outside in the market-place the bodies of the De Witts werehanging and Van Baerle read with horror the inscription "Here hangthat great rascal John de Witt and the little rascal Cornelius de Wittenemies of their country."Gryphus laughed when the prisoner asked him what it meant and replied"That's what happens to those that write secret letters to the enemiesof the Prince of Orange."A terrible despair fell on Van Baerle but he refused to escape whenRosa the gaoler's beautiful daughter suggested it to him. He wasbrought to trial and though he denied all knowledge of thecorrespondence his goods were confiscated and he was condemned todeath. He bequeathed his three tulip bulbs to Rosa explained how shemust get a certain soil from Dordrecht and went out calmly to die. Onthe scaffold Van Baerle was reprieved and sentenced to perpetualimprisonment for the Prince of Orange shrank from further bloodshed.One spectator in the crowd was bitterly disappointed. This was Boxtelwho had bribed the headsman to let him have Van Baerle's clothesbelieving that he would thus obtain the priceless bulbs.Van Baerle was sent to the prison of Loewenstein and in February 1673when he was thinking his tulips lost for ever he heard Rosa's voice.Gryphus had applied for the gaolership of Loewenstein and had beenappointed.Nothing could persuade him that if Van Baerle was not a traitor he wascertainly in league with the devil like all learned men and he did allhe could to mortify and annoy his prisoner. But Rosa would come everynight when her father stupefied by gin was asleep and talk toCornelius through the barred grating of his cell door.He taught her to read and together they planned how the tulip bulbsshould be brought to flower. One bulb Rosa was to plant the second VanBaerle would cultivate in his cell with soil placed in an old water jugand the third was to be kept in reserve.Once more hope revived in Baerle's mind but Rosa often sufferedvexation because Cornelius thought more of his black tulip than of her.In the meantime Boxtel under the assumed name of Jacob Gisels had madehis way to Loewenstein in pursuit of the bulbs and had ingratiatedhimself with Gryphus offering to marry his daughter. Rosa's tulip hadto be guarded from Gisels who was always spying on her movements. Shekept it in her room for safety but Boxtel had a key made and the day
comment552,the tulip flowered and arose a spotless black he resolved to take itat once and rush to Haarlem and claim the prize.The day came. Rosa described to Cornelius the wonderful black tulip andthey drew up a letter to the president of the Horticultural Society atHaarlem begging him to come and fetch the wonderful flower.That very night while Cornelius and Rosa rejoiced as lovers--for noweven Rosa was convinced of the prisoner's love for her--over thehappiness of the flowering tulip Boxtel crept into her room andcarried off the black tulip to Haarlem.As for Van Baerle he was beside himself with the rage of desperationwhen Rosa told him that the black tulip had been stolen. Rosa bent onrecovering the tulip and certain in her own mind as to the thiefhastened away from Loewenstein the next day without a word Gryphus wasmad when he learnt his daughter was nowhere to be found and put downthe mysterious disappearance of Jacob Gisels and Rosa to the work of thedevil and was convinced that Van Baerle was the devil's agent.The third day after the theft Gryphus armed with a stick and a knifeattacked Cornelius calling out "Give me back my daughter." Corneliusgot hold of the stick forced Gryphus to drop the knife and thenproceeded to give the gaoler a thrashing. The noise brought in turnkeysand guards who speedily carried off the wounded gaoler and arrested VanBaerle. To comfort the prisoner they assured him he would certainly beshot within twelve hours.Then an officer an aide-de-camp of the Prince of Orange enteredescorted Van Baerle to the prison gate and bade him enter a carriage.Believing himself about to die he thought sadly of Rosa and of thetulip he was never to see again. The carriage rolled off and theytravelled all that day and night until the journey ended at Haarlem._IV.--The Triumph of the Tulip_Rosa reached Haarlem just four hours after Boxtel's arrival and shewent at once to seek an interview with Mynheer van Systens thePresident of the Horticultural Society. Immediate admittance was grantedon her mentioning the magic words "black tulip.""Sir the black tulip has been stolen from me" said Rosa."But I only saw it two hours ago" replied the president."You saw it--where""Why at your master's Are you not in the service of Mynheer IsaacBoxtel""I sir Certainly not But this Isaac Boxtel is he a thinbald-headed bow-legged crook-backed haggard-looking man""You have described him exactly.""He is the thief he stole the black tulip from me.""Well go and find Mynheer Boxtel--he is at the White Swan Inn andsettle it with him." And with that the president took up his pen andwent on writing for he was busy over his report.But Rosa still implored him and while she was speaking the Prince ofOrange entered the building. Rosa told everything how she had receivedthe bulb from the prisoner at Loewenstein and how she had first seenthe prisoner at The Hague. Then Boxtel was sent for. He was ready withhis tale. The girl had plotted with her lover the state prisonerCornelius van Baerle and had stolen his--Boxtel's--black tulip whichhe had unwisely mentioned. However he had recovered it.A thought struck Rosa."There were three bulbs. What has become of the others" she asked."One failed the second produced the black tulip and the third is athome at Dordrecht" said Boxtel uneasily."You lie it is here" cried Rosa. And she drew from her bosom the thirdbulb still wrapped in the same paper Van Baerle had so hastily putround the bulbs on his flight. "Take it my lord" she said handing itto the prince. And then glancing at the paper for the first time sheadded "Oh my lord read this"William passed the third bulb to the president and read the papercarefully. It was Cornelius de Witt's letter to his godson exhortinghim to burn the packet without opening it. It was the proof of VanBaerle's innocence and of his ownership of the bulbs."Go Mynheer Boxtel you shall have justice. And you Mynheer vanSystens take care of this maiden and of the tulip" said the prince.That same evening the prince summoned Rosa to the town hall and talked
comment553,to her. Rosa did not deny her love for Cornelius."But what is the good of loving a man condemned to live and die inprison" the prince asked."I can help him to live and die" came the answer.The prince sealed a letter and sent it off to Loewenstein by Colonelvan Deken. Then he turned to Rosa and said "The day after to-morrow isSunday and it will be the festival of the tulip. Take these 500guilders and dress yourself in the costume of a Friesland bride for Iwant it to be a grand festival for you."Sunday came May 15 1673 and all Haarlem gathered to do honour to theblack tulip. Boxtel was in the crowd feasting his eyes on the sacredflower which was born aloft in a litter. The procession stopped andthe flower was placed on a pedestal while the people cheered with wildenthusiasm. At the solemn moment when the Prince of Orange was toacclaim the triumphant owner of the black tulip and present the prize of100000 guilders the coach with the unhappy prisoner Cornelius vanBaerle drew up in the market-place.Cornelius hearing that the celebration of the black tulip was actuallyproceeding besought his guard to let him have one glimpse of theflower and the petition was granted by the Prince of Orange.From a distance of six paces Van Baerle gazed at the black tulip andthen he with the multitude turned his eyes towards the prince. In deadsilence the prince declared the occasion of the festival the discoveryof the wonderful black tulip and concluded "Let the owner of the blacktulip approach."Cornelius made an involuntary movement. Boxtel and Rosa rushed forwardfrom the crowd.The prince turned to Rosa. "This tulip is yours is it not" he said."Yes my lord" she answered softly. And general applause came from thecrowd."This tulip will henceforth bear the name of its producer and will becalled _Tulipa nigra Rosa Baerttensis_ because Van Baerle is to be themarried name of this damsel" the prince announced and at the same timehe took Rosa's hand and placed it within the hand of the prisoner whohad rushed forward at the words he had heard.Boxtel fell down in a fit and when they raised him up he was dead.The procession returned to the town hall the prince declared Rosa theprizewinner and informed Cornelius that having been wrongfullycondemned his property was restored to him. Then he entered his coachand was driven away.Cornelius and Rosa departed for Dordrecht and Van Baerle remained everfaithful to his wife and his tulips.As for old Gryphus after being the roughest gaoler of men he lived tobe the fiercest guardian of tulips at Dordrecht.                                   The Corsican Brothers      "The Corsican Brothers" is one of the most famous of Dumas'     shorter stories. It was published in 1845 when the author was     at the height of his powers and is remarkable not only for     its strong dramatic interest but for its famous account of     old Corsican manners and customs being inspired by a visit to     Corsica in 1834. The scenery of the island and the life of     the inhabitants the survival of the vendetta and the fierce     family feuds all made strong appeal to his imaginative mind.     Several versions of the story have been dramatised for the     English stage and as a play "The Corsican Brothers" has     enjoyed a long popularity but Dumas himself who was fond of     adapting his works to the stage never dramatised this story._I.--The Twins_I was travelling in Corsica early in March 1841. Corsica is a Frenchdepartment but it is by no means French and Italian is the languagecommonly spoken. It is free from robbers but it is still the land of
comment554,the vendetta and the province of Sartene wherein I was travelling isthe home of family feuds which last for years and are alwaysaccompanied by loss of life.I was travelling alone across the island but I had been obliged to takea guide and when at five o'clock we halted on a hill overlooking thevillage of Sullacro my guide asked me where I would like to stay forthe night. There were perhaps one hundred and twenty houses inSullacro for me to choose from so after looking out carefully for theone that promised the most comfort I decided in favour of a strongfortified squarely-built house."Certainly" said my guide. "That is the house of Madame Savilia deFranchi. Your honour has chosen wisely."I was a little uncertain whether it was quite the right thing for me toseek hospitality at a house belonging to a lady for being onlythirty-six I considered myself a young man. But I found it quiteimpossible to make my guide understand my feelings. The notion that mystaying a night could give occasion for gossip concerning my hostess orthat it made any difference whether I was old or young wasunintelligible to a Corsican.Madame Savilia I learnt from the guide was about forty and had twosons--twins--twenty-one years old. One lived with his mother and was aCorsican the other was in Paris preparing to be a lawyer.We soon arrived at the house we sought. My guide knocked vigorously atthe door which was promptly opened by a man in velvet waistcoat andbreeches and leather gaiters. I explained that I sought hospitality andwas answered in return that the house was honoured by my request. Myluggage was carried off and I entered.In the corridor a beautiful woman tall and dressed in black met me.She bade me welcome and promised me that of her son telling me thatthe house was at my service.A maid-servant was called to conduct me to the room of M. Louis and assupper would be served in an hour I went upstairs.My room was evidently that of the absent son and the most comfortablein the house. Its furniture was all modern and there was a well-filledbookcase. I hastily looked at the volumes they denoted a student ofliberal mind.A few minutes later and my host M. Lucien de Franchi entered. Iobserved that he was young of sunburnt complexion well made andfearless and resolute in his bearing."I am anxious to see that you have all you need" he said "for weCorsicans are still savages and this old hospitality which is almostthe only tradition of our forefathers left has its shortcomings for theFrench."I assured him that the apartment was far from suggesting savagery."My brother Louis likes to live after the French fashion" Lucienanswered. He went on to speak of his brother for whom he had a profoundaffection. They had already been parted for ten months and it was threeor four years before Louis was expected home.As for Lucien nothing he said would make him leave Corsica. Hebelonged to the island and could not live without its torrents itsrocks and its forests. The physical resemblance between himself and hisbrother he told me was very great but there was considerabledifference of temperament.Having completed my own change of dress I went into Lucien's room athis suggestion. It was a regular armoury and all the furniture was atleast 300 years old.While my host put on the dress of a mountaineer for he mentioned to methat he had to attend a meeting after supper he told me the history ofsome of the carbines and daggers that hung round the room. Of a truthhe came of an utterly fearless stock to whom death was of small accountby the side of courage and honour.At supper Madame de Franchi could not help expressing her anxiety forher absent son. No letter had been received but Lucien for days hadbeen feeling wretched and depressed."We are twins" he said simply "and however greatly we are separatedwe have one and the same body as we had at our birth. When anything
comment555,happens to one of us be it physical or mental it at once affects theother. I know that Louis is not dead for I should have seen him againin that case.""You would have told me if he had come" said Madame de Franchianxiously."At the very moment mother."I was amazed. Neither of them seemed to express the slightest doubt orsurprise at this extraordinary statement.Lucien went on to regret the passing of the old customs of Corsica. Hisvery brother had succumbed to the French spirit and on his return wouldsettle down as an advocate at Ajaccio and probably prosecute men whokilled their enemies in a vendetta. "And I too am engaged in affairsunworthy of a De Franchi" he concluded. "You have come to Corsica withcuriosity about its inhabitants. If you care to set out with me aftersupper I will show you a real bandit."I accepted the invitation with pleasure._II.--M. Luden de Franchi_Lucien explained to me the object of our expedition. For ten years thevillage of Sullacro had been divided over the quarrel of two familiesthe Orlandi and the Colona--a quarrel that had originated in the seizureof a paltry hen belonging to the Orlandi which had flown into thepoultry-yard of the Colonas. Nine people had already been killed in thisfeud and now Lucien as arbitrator was to bring it to an end. Thelocal prefect had written to Paris that one word from De Franchi wouldend the dispute and Louis had appealed to him.To-night Lucien was to arrange matters with Orlandi as he had alreadydone with Colona and the meeting-place was at the ruins of the Castleof Vicentello d'Istria. It was a steep ascent but we arrived in goodtime and while we sat and waited Lucien told me terrible stories offeuds and vengeance. Orlandi made his appearance exactly at nineo'clock and after some discussion agreed to Lucien's terms. I foundthat I was expected to act as surety for Orlandi and accepted theresponsibility."You will now be able to tell my brother on your return to Paris thatit's all been settled as he wished" said Lucien.On our way home Lucien showed wonderful marksmanship with his gun andadmitted he was equally skillful with the pistol. His brother Louis onthe other hand had never touched either gun or pistol.Next morning came the grand reconciliation of Orlandi and Colona in themarket square in the presence of the mayor and the notary. The mayorcompelled the belligerents to shake hands a document was signeddeclaring the vendetta at an end and everybody went to mass.Later in the day I was compelled to bid good-bye to Madame de Franchiand her son and set out for Paris but before I left Lucien told me howin his family his father had appeared to him on his death-bed and thatnot only at death but at any great crisis in life an apparitionappeared. He was certain by his own depression that his brother Louiswas suffering.Lucien told me his brother's address 7 Rue du Helder and gave me aletter which I undertook to deliver personally.We parted with great cordiality and a week later I was back in Paris._III.--The Fate of Louis_I was startled by the extraordinary resemblance of M. Louis de Franchiwhom I had at once called upon to his brother.
comment556,I was relieved to find that he was not suffering from illness and Itold him of the anxiety of his family concerning his health. M. deFranchi replied that he had not been ill but that he had been sufferingfrom a very bitter disappointment aggravated by the knowledge that hisown suffering caused his brother to suffer too. He hoped however thattime would heal the wound in his heart.We agreed to meet the following night at the opera ball at midnight onthe young lawyer's suggestion. I rallied him on his recovery from hissorrow but Louis only said mournfully that he was driven by fatedragged against his will."I am quite sure" he said "that it would be better for me not to gobut nevertheless I am going."Louis was too pre-occupied to talk when we met at the masked ball andhe suddenly left me for a lady carrying violets. Later he rejoined meand together we set off to supper at three o'clock in the morning. Itwas my friend D----'s supper party and he had included Louis in theinvitation.We found our friends waiting supper and D---- announced that the onlyperson who had not arrived was Chteau-Renard. It seemed there was awager on that M. de Chteau-Renard would not arrive with a certain ladywhom he had undertaken to bring to supper.Louis who was as pale as death implored D---- not to mention thelady's name and our host acceded to the request."Only as her husband is at Smyrna or in India or Mexico or somewhereand in such a case it's the same as if the lady wasn't married" D----observed."I assure you her husband is coming back soon and he is such a goodfellow he would be horribly mortified to hear his wife had done anythingsilly in his absence."Chteau-Renard had till four o'clock to save his bet. At five minutes tofour he had not arrived and Louis smiled at me over his wine. At thatvery moment the bell rang. D---- went to the door and we could hearsome argument going on in the hall.Then a lady entered with obvious reluctance escorted by D---- andChteau-Renard."It's not yet four" said Chteau-Renard to D----."Quite right my boy" the other answered. "You've won your bet.""No hardly yet sir" said the unknown lady. "Now I know why you wereso persistent. You have wagered to bring me here to supper and Isupposed you were taking me to sup with one of my own friends."Both Chteau-Renard and D---- besought the lady to stay but the fairunknown after expressing her thanks to D---- for his welcome turned toM. Louis de Franchi and asked him to escort her home. Louis at oncesprang forward.Chteau-Renard furious insisted that he would know whom to holdaccountable."If I am the person meant" said Louis with great dignity "you willfind me at home at 7 Rue du Helder all day to-morrow."Louis departed with his fair companion and though Chteau-Renard wasostentatiously cheerful the end of the supper-party was not at all afestive business.At ten o'clock the same morning I arrived at the rooms of M. Louis deFranchi. The seconds of Chteau-Renard had already called and I passedthem on the stairs.Louis had written me a note with another friend Baron GiordanoMartelli the affair was to be arranged with Baron de Chteaugrand andM. de Boissy the gentleman I had met on the stairs.I looked at the cards of these two men and asked Louis if the matterwas of any great seriousness.Louis replied by telling the story of the quarrel. A friend of his asea captain had married a beautiful woman so beautiful and so youngthat Louis could not help falling in love with her. As an honourable manhe had kept away from the house and then on being reproached by hisfriend had frankly told him the reason.In return his friend who was just setting off for Mexico commendedhis wife Emilie whom he adored and trusted absolutely to his care
comment557,and asked his wife to consider Louis de Franchi as her brother. For sixmonths the captain had been away and Emilie had been living at hermother's. To this house among other visitors had come M. de Chteau-Renard and from the first this typical man of the world had been anobject of dislike to Louis. Emilie's flirtations with Chteau-Renard atlast provoked a remonstrance from Louis and in return the lady told himthat he was in love with her himself and that he was absurd in hisnotions. After that Louis had left off calling on Emilie but gossip wassoon busy with the lady's name.An anonymous letter had made an appointment for Louis with the lady ofthe violets at the masked ball and from this person he was informedagain not only of Emilie's infidelity but further that M. deChteau-Renard had wagered he would bring her to supper at D----'s.The rest I knew and I could only assent mournfully that things must goon and that the proposals of Chteau-Renard's seconds could not bedeclined.But M. Louis de Franchi had never touched sword or pistol in his lifeHowever there was nothing for it but to return M. de Chteaugrand'scall.Martelli and I found that Chteau-Renard's two supporters were bothpolite men of the world. They were as indifferent as Louis was to thechoice of weapons and by a spin of a coin it was decided that pistolswere to be used.The place agreed upon for the duel was the Bois de Vincennes and thetime nine o'clock the following morning.I called in the evening on Louis to ask him if he had any instructionsfor me but his only reply was "Counsel comes with the night" so Iwaited on him next morning.He was just finishing a letter when I entered and he bade his servantJoseph leave us undisturbed for ten minutes."I am anxious" said Louis "that my friend Giordano Martelli who is aCorsican should not know of this letter. But you must promise to carryout my wishes and then my family may be saved a second misfortune. Nowplease read the letter."I read the letter Louis had written. It was to his mother and it saidthat he was dying of brain fever. Her son writing in a lucid intervalwas beyond hope of recovery. It would be posted to her a quarter of anhour after his death. There was an affectionate postscript to Lucien."What does this mean I don't understand it" I said."It means that at ten minutes past nine I shall be dead. I have been
comment558,forewarned that is all. My father appeared to me last night andannounced my death."He spoke so simply of this visit that if it was an illusion it was asterribly convincing as the truth."There is one thing more" said Louis. "If my brother was to hear that Ihad been killed in a duel he would at once leave Sullacro to come andfight the man who had killed me. And then if he were killed in his turnmy mother would be thrice widowed. To prevent that I have written thisletter. If it is believed that I have died of brain fever no one can beblamed." He paused. "Unless unless--but no that must not be."I knew that my own strange fear was his.On the way to Vincennes Baron Giordano stopped to get a case of pistolspowder and balls and we arrived at our destination just as M. deChteau-Renard's carriage drove up. At M. de Chteaugrand's suggestionwe all made our way to a certain glade away from the public pathway.Martelli and Chteaugrand measured the distance together while Louisbade me farewell asking me to accept his watch and begging me to keepthe duel out of the papers and to prevail upon Giordano not to let anyword of the matter reach Sullacro.M. Chteau-Renard was at his post. Baron Giordano gave Louis his pistol.Chteaugrand called out "Gentlemen are you ready" Then he clapped hishands "One two three."Two shots went off at the same moment and Louis de Franchi fell. Hisopponent was unhurt. I rushed to Louis and raised him up. Blood came tohis lips. It was useless to send for a surgeon.Chteau-Renard had withdrawn but his seconds hastened to express theirhorror at the fatal ending of the combat.Chteaugrand added that he hoped M. de Franchi bore no malice againsthis opponent."No no I forgive him" said Louis. "But tell him to leave Paris. Hemust go."The dying man spoke with difficulty. He reminded me of my promise andasked me as he fell back to look at my watch.It was exactly ten minutes past nine and Louis was dead.We carried the body back to the house and Giordano made the requiredstatement to the District Commissioner of Police. Then the house wassealed by the police and Louis de Franchi was laid to rest inPre-La-chaise. But M. de Chteau-Renard could not be persuaded to leaveParis though MM. de Boissy and de Chteaugrand both did their best toinduce him to go._IV.--Lucien Takes Vengeance_One night five days after the funeral I was working late at mywriting-table when my servant entered and told me in a frightened tonethat M. de Franchi wanted to speak to me."Who" I said in astonishment."M. de Franchi sir your friend--the gentleman who has been here onceor twice to see you.""You must be out of your senses Victor Don't you know that he diedfive days ago""Yes sir and that's why I am so upset. I heard a ring at the bell andwhen I opened the door he walked in asked if you were at home andtold me to tell you that M. de Franchi desired to speak with you.""Are you out of your mind my good man I suppose the hall is badly lit
comment559,and you were half-asleep and heard the name wrong. Go back and ask thename again.""No sir I will swear that I'm not mistaken. I'm sure I heard and sawperfectly.""Very well then show him in."Victor went back to the door trembling all the time and said "Pleasestep in sir."My hasty sensation of terror was quickly dispelled. It was Lucien whowas apologising to me for disturbing me at such an hour."The fact is" he said "I only arrived ten minutes ago and you willunderstand how impossible it was not to come and see you at once."I at once thought of the letter I had sent. In five days it could nothave reached Sullacro."Good heaven" I cried. "Nothing is known to you""Everything is known" he said quietly.Lucien mentioned that on going to his brother's house the people wereso panic-stricken that they refused the door to him."Tell me" I said when we were alone. "You must have been on your wayhere when you heard the fatal news""On the contrary I was at Sullacro. Have you for-forgotten what I toldyou about the apparitions in my family""Has your brother appeared to you" I cried."Yes. He told me he had been killed in a duel by M. de Chteau-Renard. Isaw my brother in his room the day he was killed" Lucien went on "andthat night in a dream I saw the place where the duel was fought andheard the name of M. de Chteau-Renard. And I have come to Paris to killthe man who killed my brother. My brother had never touched a pistol inhis life and it was as easy to kill him as to kill a tame stag. Mymother knows why I have come. She is a true Corsican and she kissed meon the forehead and said 'Go'"The next morning Lucien wrote to Giordano and sent a challenge toChteau-Renard. Then he went with me to Vincennes and though he hadnever been there in his life before Lucien walked straight to the spotwhere his brother had fallen. He turned round walked twenty paces andsaid "This is where the villain stood and to-morrow he will lie here."Lucien predicted with absolute confidence the death of Chteau-Renard.The challenge was accepted the same seconds acted and on the morrow weassembled in the fatal glade. Chteau-Renard was obviously uneasy. The
comment560,signal was given both men fired and sure enough Chteau-Renard fellshot through the temple as Lucien had foretold.Then for the first time since Louis' death Lucien burst into tears. Hedropped his pistol and threw himself into my arms. "My brother my dearbrother" he cried.                                   The Count of Monte Cristo      "The Count of Monte Cristo" appeared in 1844 when Dumas had     been writing plays and stories for twenty years and at a     period when he was most extraordinarily prolific. In that     year assisted by his staff of compilers and transcribers he     is said to have turned out something like forty volumes     "Monte Cristo" first gave Dumas' novels a world-wide audience.     Its unflagging spirit the endless surprises and the air of     reality which was cast over the most extravagant situations     made the work worthy of the popularity it enjoyed in almost     every country in the world. The island from which it takes its     name is a barren rock rising 2000 feet out of the sea a few     miles south of Elba. Dumas attempted to emulate Scott and     built a chteau near St. Germain which he called Monte     Cristo costing over 125000. It was afterwards sold for a     tenth of that sum to pay his debts._I.--The Conspiracy of Envy_On February 28 1815 the three-masted Pharaon arrived at Marseillesfrom Smyrna commanded by the first mate young Edmond Dants thecaptain having died on the voyage. He had left a package for theMarchal Bertrand on the Isle of Elba which Dants had duly deliveredconversing with the exiled Emperor Napoleon himself.The shipowner M. Morrel confirmed young Dants in the command andoverjoyed he hastened to his father and then to the village of theCatalans near Marseilles where the dark-eyed Mercds his betrothedimpatiently awaited him.But his good fortune excited envy. Danglars the supercargo of thePharaon wanted the command for himself and Fernand the Catalan cousinof Mercds hated Dants because he had won her heart. Fernand'sjealousy so took possession of him that he fell in willingly with ascheme which the envious Danglars proposed. Making use of Dants'compromising visit to Elba they addressed an anonymous denunciation tothe _procureur du roi_ which in this period of Bonapartist plots wasindeed a formidable matter. Caderousse a boon companion was at firsttaken into their confidence but as he came to think it a dangeroustrick to play the young captain he refused to take part in it.On the morrow the wedding-feast took place and at two o'clock Dantsradiant with joy and happiness prepared to accompany his bride to thehotel de ville for the civil ceremony. But at that moment the measuredtread of soldiery was heard on the stairs and a magistrate presentedhimself bearing an order for the arrest of Edmond Dants. Resistance orremonstrance was useless and Dants suffered himself to be taken toMarseilles where he was examined by the deputy _procureur du roi_ M.de Villefort. To him on demand he recounted the story of his visit toElba."Ah" said Villefort "if you have been culpable it was imprudence. Giveup this letter you have brought from Elba and go and rejoin yourfriends.""You have it already" cried Dants.Villefort glanced at it and sank into his seat stupefied. It wasaddressed to M. Noirtier a staunch Bonapartist."Oh if he knew the contents of this" murmured he "and that Noirtieris father of Villefort I am lost" He approached the fire and cast thefatal letter in."Sir" said he "I shall detail you till this evening in the Palais deJustice. Should anyone else interrogate you do not breathe a word ofthis letter.""I promise."It was Villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner to reassurehim.But the doom of Edmond Dants was cast. Sacrificed to Villefort'sambition he was lodged the same night in a dungeon of the gloomy
comment561,fortress-prison of the Chteau d'If while Villefort posted to Paris towarn the king that the usurper Bonaparte was meditating a landing inFrance.Napoleon returned. There followed the Hundred Days and Louis XVIII.again mounted the throne. M. Morrel's intercessions during Napoleon'sbrief triumph for the release of Dants but served on the restorationof Louis to compromise further the unhappy prisoner who languished ina foul prison in the depths of the Chteau d'If.In the cell next to Dants was another political prisoner the AbbFaria. He had been in the chteau four years when Dants was immuredand with marvellously contrived tools and incredible toil had burroweda tunnel through the rock fifty feet long only to find that instead ofleading to the outer wall of the chteau whence he could have flunghimself into the sea it led to the cell of another prisoner--Dants. Hepenetrated it after Dants had been solitary six years.The prisoners met every day between the visits of their gaolers. Fariashowed Dants the products of his industry and ingenuity--his bookswritten on the linen of shirts his fish-bone pens and needles knivesand matches all accomplished secretly and beguiled much of theweariness of confinement by educating Dants in the sciences historyand languages. Dants possessed a prodigious memory combined withreadiness of conception and his studies progressed rapidly. Soon Dantstold the abb his story and the abb had little difficulty in openingthe eyes of the astonished Dants to the villainy of his supposedfriends and the deputy _procurer_. Thus was instilled into his heart anew passion--vengeance._II.--The Cemetery of the Chteau d'If_More than seven years passed thus when coming into the abb's dungeonone night Dants found him stricken with paralysis. His right arm andleg remained paralysed after the seizure. When Dants next visited himthe abb showed him a paper half-burnt and rolled in a cylinder."This paper" said Faria "is my treasure and if I have not beenallowed to possess it you will. Who knows if another attack may notcome and all be finished"The abb had been secretary to the last of the Counts of Spada one ofthe most powerful families of mediaeval Italy and he dying in povertyhad left Faria an old breviary which had been in the family since thedays of the Borgias. In this by chance Faria found a piece of yellowedpaper on which when put in the fire writing began to appear. From theremains of the paper he made out during the early days of hisimprisonment that a Cardinal Spada at the end of the fifteenthcentury fearing poisoning at the hands of Pope Alexander VI. hadburied in the Island of Monte Cristo a rock between Corsica and Elbaall his ingots gold money and jewels amounting then to nearly twomillion Roman crowns."The last Count of Spada made me his heir" said the abb. "The treasurenow amounts to nearly thirteen millions of money"The abb remained paralysed and had given up all hope of enjoying the
comment562,treasure himself and presently another seizure took him and one nightDants was alone with the corpse.Next morning the preparations for burying the dead man were made thebody being placed in a sack and left in the cell till the evening.Dants came into the cell again."Ah" he muttered. "Since the dead leave this dungeon let me assume theplace of the dead"Opening the sack he took out the dead body of his friend and draggedit through the tunnel to his own cell. Placing it on his own bed hecovered it with the rags he wore himself. Then he sewed himself in thesack with one of the abb's needles. In his hand he held the dead man'sknife and with palpitating heart awaited events.Slowly the hours dragged on until at length he heard the heavyfootsteps of the gaolers descending to the cell. They lifted the sackand carried him on a bier through the castle passages until they cameto a door which was opened. On passing through this the noise of thewaves was heard as they dashed on the rocks below.Then Dants felt that they took him by the head and by the heels andflung him into the sea into whose depths he was dragged by a thirty-six-pound shot tied to his feet. The sea is the cemetery of Chteaud'IfAlthough giddy and almost suffocated he had yet sufficient presence ofmind to hold his breath and as his right hand held his knife herapidly ripped up the sack extricated his arm and then by a desperateeffort severed the cord that bound his legs at the moment he wassuffocating. With a vigorous spring he rose to the surface paused tobreathe and then dived again in order to avoid being seen. When herose again he struck boldly out to sea and fortunately was picked upby a sailing-vessel.Now at liberty fourteen years after his arrest he renewed an oath ofimplacable vengeance against Danglars Fernand and Villefort. Nor wasit long before he had discovered the secret cave in the island of MonteCristo with all its dazzling wealth as the Abbe Faria had trulyforetold. He now stood possessed of such means of vengeance as never inhis wildest dreams had any innocent prisoner hoped to be able tocommand._III.--Vengeance Begins_Some two years later Caspar Caderousse the keeper of an inn nearBeaucaire was lounging listlessly at his door when a traveller onhorseback dismounted at his door and entered. The visitor--MonteCristo--gave the name of Abbe Busoni and astonished Caderousse byshowing a minute knowledge of his earlier history. The abb explainedthat he had been present at the death of Edmond Dants in prison andsaid that even in his dying moments the prisoner had protested he wasutterly ignorant of the cause of his imprisonment."And so he was" exclaimed Caderousse. "How should he have beenotherwise"The abb had heard of the death of Edmond's aged father and now he wastold the old man had died of starvation."Thus Heaven recompenses virtue" said Caderousse. "I am in destitutionand shall die of hunger as old Dants did whilst Fernand and Danglarsroll in wealth. All their malpractices have turned to luck. Danglarsspeculated and made a fortune. He is a millionaire and now CountDanglars. Fernand played traitor at the battle of Ligny and that servedfor his recommendation to the Bourbons. Afterwards he became Count deMorcerf and got a considerable sum by the betrayal of Ali Pasha in theGreek war of independence."The abb making an effort said "And Mercds--she disappeared""Yes as the sun to rise next day with more splendour. She is rich theCountess de Morcerf--she waited two hopeless years for Dants--and yet Iam sure she is not happy.""And M. de Villefort" asked the abb."Some time after having arrested Dants he married and left Marseillesno doubt but he has been as lucky as the rest.""God may seem sometimes to forget for a time" said the abb "while Hisjustice reposes but there always comes a moment when He remembers."
comment563,                                   Early in 1838 a certain Count of Monte Cristo became a great figure inthe life of Paris. His name awakened thoughts of romance and dazzlingwealth in the minds of all. It was Albert the son of the Count deMorcerf who first introduced the Count of Monte Cristo to the highsociety of Paris. They had become acquainted at Rome where Monte Cristohad been able to render a great service to the Viscount Albert deMorcerf and his friend the Baron Franz d'Epinay.All sorts of stories were afloat in Paris as to the history of thisCount of Monte Cristo. When he went to the opera he was accompanied by abeautiful Greek girl named Haide whose guardian he was.But nothing ruffled Monte Cristo. Calmness and deliberation marked allhis movements in some respects he was more like a machine than a humanbeing. Everything he said he would do was done precisely. And now theschemes he had long studied in secret he had begun to carry through ascertainly and relentlessly as Fate.M. de Villefort now _procureur du roi_ had a daughter by his firstwife for he had married a second time. Her name was Valentine and atthe command of her father but not by her own wish she was engaged tothe Baron Franz d'Epinay. She loved a young military officer namedMaximilian Morrel a son of the Marseilles shipowner. But neither ofthem had dared to avow their affection for each other to Valentine'sfather.Meanwhile the tide of fortune seemed to have turned with BaronDanglars. His business had suffered many losses but his greatest lossof all was due to some false news about the price of shares which hadbeen telegraphed to Paris by means which Monte Cristo could haveexplained.The baron's daughter was engaged to Albert de Morcerf but the Count ofMorcerf had now come under a cloud for his betrayal of Ali Pasha hadbeen made public and perhaps the Count of Monte Cristo could have toldhow the truth came out at last. So the baron did not hesitate to breakthe engagement and to accept as the suitor for his daughter a dashingyoung man known as Count Cavalcanti who had been introduced to Paris by
comment564,Monte Cristo but concerning whose antecedents nothing seemed to beknown.The Count de Morcerf was tried for his betrayal of Ali and seemedlikely to be acquitted when a veiled woman was brought to the place oftrial and testified before the committee that she was the daughter ofAli Pasha and that Morcerf had not only betrayed her father to theTurks but had sold her and her mother into slavery. The veiled womanwas Haide the ward of Monte Cristo. The count was now a ruined manand when his son Albert discovered the part that Monte Cristo hadplayed he publicly insulted the count at the opera.A duel was averted for Albert publicly apologised to the count when helearned the reasons for his actions. Furious that he had not beenavenged by his son Morcerf rushed to the house of Monte Cristo."I came to tell you" said Morcerf "that as the young people of thepresent day will not fight it remains for us to do it.""So much the better" said Monte Cristo. "Are you prepared""Yes sir and witnesses are unnecessary as we know each other solittle.""Truly they are unnecessary" said Monte Cristo "but for the reasonthat we know each other well. Are you not the soldier Fernand whodeserted on the eve of Waterloo Are you not the Lieutenant Fernand whoserved as guide and spy to the French army in Spain Are you not theCaptain Fernand who betrayed sold and murdered his benefactor Ali""Oh" cried the general "wretch to reproach me with my shame Tell meyour real name that I may pronounce it when I plunge my sword throughyour heart."At this Monte Cristo bounding to a dressing room near quickly pulledoff his coat and waistcoat and donning a sailor's jacket and hat wasback in an instant.Gazing for a moment in terror at this man who seemed to have risen fromthe dead to avenge his wrongs Morcerf turned seeking the wall tosupport him and went out by the door uttering the cry--"Edmond Dants"Events marched rapidly now and Paris had scarcely ceased talking of thesuicide of the Count de Morcerf when Cavalcanti identified as a formergalley-slave named Benedetto was arrested for the murder of a fellow-convict.Danglars fled from France his great business in ruin. With him he tooka large sum of money belonging to Paris hospitals which however wastaken from him near Rome by brigands controlled by Monte Cristo._IV.--Vengeance is Complete_In the household of Villefort Monte Cristo had done nothing to bringvengeance on that evil man. He had seen from the first that Villefort'ssecond wife was studying the art of poisoning and he felt that revengewas already at work here. There had already been three mysterious deathsin the house and now the beautiful Valentine seemed to be sufferingfrom the early effects of some slow poison. Maximilian Morrel indespair of Valentine's life rushed to Monte Cristo for his advice andassistance."Must I let one of the accursed race escape" Monte Cristo askedhimself but decided for Maxmilian's sake that he would saveValentine. He had bought the house adjoining that of Villefort andclearing out the tenants had engaged workmen to remove so much of theold wall between the two houses that it was a simple matter for him totake out the remaining stones and pass into a large cupboard inValentine's room. Here the count watched while Valentine was asleep andsaw Madame de Villefort creep into the room and substitute for themedicine in Valentine's glass a dose of poison.He then entered the room and threw half the draught into the fireplaceleaving the rest in the glass. When Valentine awoke he gave her a pelletof hashish which made her sink into a deathlike sleep.Next morning the doctor declared that Valentine was dead. In the glass
comment565,he discovered poison and as the same poison was found in madame'slaboratory there was no doubt of her guilt. She admitted all andconfessed that her object had been to make her own son sole heir toVillefort's fortune.Madame de Villefort fell at her husband's feet. He addressed her withpassionate words of reproach as he turned to leave her."Think of it madame" he said "if on my return justice has not beensatisfied I will denounce you with my own mouth and arrest you with myown hands I am going to the court to pronounce sentence of death on amurderer. If I find you alive on my return you shall sleep to-night ingaol."Madame sighed her nerves gave way and she sank on the carpet.But Villefort little knew at the moment he spoke these burning words tothe woman who was his wife that he himself was not going out to condemna fellow-sinner but to be himself condemned. For the man to whom hereferred as a murderer was the so-called Count Cavalcanti reallyBenedetto who now turned out to be an illegitimate son of Villefort'swhom he had endeavoured to bury alive as an infant in the garden of ahouse at Auteuil. The night before the criminal had had a long interviewwith Monte Cristo's steward who had disclosed to the prisoner thesecret of his birth and in court he declared his father was Villefortthe public prosecutor This statement made a great commotion in thecourt and all eyes were on Villefort while Benedetto continued toanswer the questions of the president and proved that he was the childwhom Villefort would have buried alive years before. The publicprosecutor himself confirmed the prisoner's story by admitting hisguilt and staggering from the court.When Villefort arrived at his own house he found everything inconfusion. Making his way to his wife's apartments he had the horror ofmeeting her while she still lived just at the very instant when thepoison she had taken did its work and of finding a moment or two afterthat she had poisoned his little son Edward.This was more than the brain of man could endure and Villefort turnedfrom the tragic scene a raving madman rushing wildly to the garden andbeginning to dig with a spade.The vengeance of Edmond Dants so long delayed so carefully andlaboriously planned was now complete and it only remained for him toperform the last of his marvels at the same time giving proof of hisboundless generosity. Valentine de Villefort had been buried andMaximilian was in despair but Monte Cristo urged the young man to havepatience and hope.It seemed a strange thing to ask a lover whose sweetheart had beenplaced within the tomb to have hope and to come to Monte Cristo in onemonth. But this was the bargain they made.When the month had passed Maximilian came to the isle of Monte Cristo."I have your word" he said to the count "that you would help me die orgive me Valentine""Ah A miracle alone can save you--the resurrection of Valentine Thusdo I fulfil my promise"Monte Cristo turned to a jewelled cabinet and took from it a tube ofgreenish paste. Maximilian swallowed some of the mysterious substancewhich was but hashish. He sat down and waited."Monte Cristo" he said "I feel that I am dying--good-bye"Meanwhile Monte Cristo had opened a door from which a great lightstreamed. Maximilian opened his eyes looked towards the light andthen--he saw ValentineThen Monte Cristo spoke. "He calls you Valentine even as he thinks hedies by his own will. But even as I saved you from the tomb so have Isaved him. I feared for his reason if he saw you except in a trance--from his trance he will wake to happiness"
comment566,Next morning Valentine and Maximilian were walking on the beach whenJacopo the captain of Monte Cristo's yacht gave them a letter. As theylooked on the superscription they cried simultaneously "Gone"In his letter Monte Cristo said "All that is in this grotto myfriend my house in the Champs Elyses and my chteau at Trport arethe marriage gifts bestowed by Edmond Dants upon the son of his oldmaster Morrel. Mademoiselle de Villefort will share them with you forI entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to herfrom her father now a madman and her brother who died last Septemberwith his mother.""But where is the count" asked Morrel eagerly. Jacopo pointed towardsthe horizon where a white sail was visible."And where is Haide" asked Valentine. Jacopo still pointed towards thesail.                                   The Three Musketeers      It was not till the publication of "The Three Musketeers" in     1844 that the amazing gifts of Dumas were fully recognised.     From 1844 till 1850 the literary output of novels plays and     historical memoirs was enormous and so great was the demand     for Dumas' work that he made no attempt to supply his     customers single-handed but engaged a host of assistants and     was content to revise and amend--or in some cases only to     sign--their productions. "The Three Musketeers" was followed     by its sequel "Twenty Years After" in 1845 and the story     was continued still further in the "Vicomte de Bragelonne."     The "Valois" series of novels "Monte Cristo" and the     "Memoirs of a Physician" were all published before 1850 in     addition to many dramatised versions of stories._I.--The Musketeer's Apprenticeship_D'Artagnan was without acquaintances in Paris and now on the very dayof his arrival he was committed to fight with three of the mostdistinguished of the king's musketeers.Coming from Gascony a youth with all the pride and ambition of hisrace D'Artagnan had brought no money with him but only a letter ofintroduction from his father to M. de Treville captain of themusketeers. But he had been taught that by courage alone could a man nowmake his way to fortune and that he was to bear nothing save from thecardinal--the great Cardinal Richelieu or from the king--Louis XIII.It was immediately after his interview with M. de Treville thatD'Artagnan well trained at home as a swordsman quarrelled with thethree musketeers.First on the palace stairs he ran violently into Athos who wassuffering from a wounded shoulder."Excuse me" said D'Artagnan. "Excuse me but I am in a hurry.""You are in a hurry" said the musketeer pale as a sheet. "Under thatpretence you run against me you say 'Excuse me' and you think thatsufficient. You are not polite it is easy to see that you are from thecountry."D'Artagnan had already passed on but this remark made him stop short."However far I may come it is not you monsieur who can give me alesson in manners I warn you.""Perhaps" said Athos "you are in a hurry now but you can find mewithout running after me. Do you understand me.""Where and when" said D'Artagnan."Near the Carmes-Deschaux at noon" replied Athos. "And please do not
comment567,keep me waiting for at a quarter past twelve I will cut off your earsif you run.""Good" cried D'Artagnan. "I will be there at ten minutes to twelve."At the street gate Porthos was talking with the soldiers on guard.Between the two there was just room for a man to pass and D'Artagnanhurried on only to find himself enveloped in the long velvet cloak ofPorthos which the wind had blown out."The fellow must be mad" said Porthos "to run against people in thismanner Do you always forget your eyes when you happen to be in ahurry""No" replied D'Artagnan who in extricating himself from the cloakhad observed that the handsome cloth of gold coat worn by Porthos wasonly gold in front and plain buff at the back "no and thanks to myeyes I can see what others cannot see.""Monsieur" said Porthos angrily "you stand a chance of gettingchastised if you run against musketeers in this fashion. I shall lookfor you at one o'clock behind the Luxembourg.""Very well at one o'clock then" replied D'Artagnan turning into thestreet.A few minutes later D'Artagnan annoyed Aramis the third musketeer whowas chatting with some gentleman of the king's musketeers. As D'Artagnancame up Aramis accidentally dropped an embroidered pocket-handkerchiefand covered it at once with his foot to prevent observation. D'Artagnanconscious of a certain want of politeness in his treatment of Athos andPorthos and determined to be more obliging in future stooped andpicked up the handkerchief--much to the vexation of Aramis who deniedall claim to the delicate piece of cambric.D'Artagnan not taking the rebukes of Aramis in good part they fixed twoo'clock as the hour of meeting.The two young men bowed and separated Aramis going up the street whichled to the Luxembourg whilst D'Artagnan finding that it was near noontook the road to the Carmes-Deschaux saying to himself "Decidedly Ican't draw back but at least if I am killed I shall be killed by amusketeer."Knowing nobody in Paris D'Artagnan went to his appointment without asecond.It was just striking twelve when he arrived on the ground and Athosstill suffering from his old wound on the shoulder was already waitingfor his adversary.Athos explained with all politeness that his seconds had not yetarrived."If you are in great haste monsieur" said D'Artagnan "and if it beyour will to despatch me at once do not inconvenience yourself. I amready. But if you would wait three days till your shoulder is healed Ihave a miraculous balsam given me by my mother and I am sure thisbalsam will cure your wound. At the end of three days it would still dome a great honour to be your man.""That is well said" said Athos "and it pleases me. Thus spoke thegallant knights of Charlemagne. Monsieur I love men of your stamp andI can tell that if we don't kill each other I shall enjoy your society.But here comes my seconds.""What" cried D'Artagnan as Porthos and Aramis appeared. "Are thesegentlemen your seconds""Yes" replied Athos. "Are you not aware that we are never seen onewithout the others and that we are called the three inseparables""What does this mean" said Porthos who had now come up and stoodastonished."This is the gentleman I am to fight with" said Athos pointing toD'Artagnan and saluting him."Why I am also going to fight with him" said Porthos."But not before one o'clock" replied D'Artagnan."Well and I also am going to fight with that gentleman" said Aramis."But not till two o'clock" said D'Artagnan calmly."And now you are all assembled gentleman permit me to offer you myexcuses."At this word "excuses" a cloud passed over the brow of Athos a haughtysmile curled the lip of Porthos and a negative sign was the reply ofAramis."You do not understand me gentleman" said D'Artagnan throwing up hishead. "I ask to be excused in case I should not be able to discharge mydebt to all three for M. Athos has the right to kill me first. And nowgentleman I repeat excuse me but on that account only and--guard"
comment568,At these words D'Artagnan drew his sword and at that moment so elatedwas he that he would have drawn his sword against all the musketeers inthe kingdom.Scarcely had the two rapiers sounded on meeting when a company of thecardinal's guards appeared on the scene. At that time there was not onlya standing feud between the king's musketeers and the guards of CardinalRichelieu there was also a prohibition against duelling."The cardinal's guards The cardinal's guards" cried Aramis and Porthosat the same time. "Sheathe swords gentlemen Sheathe swords" But itwas too late.Jussac commander of the guards had seen the combatants in a positionwhich could not be mistaken."Hullo musketeers" he called out "fighting are you in spite of theedicts Well duty before everything. Sheathe your swords please andfollow us.""That is quite impossible" said Aramis politely. "The best thing youcan do is to pass on your way.""We shall charge upon you then" said Jussac. "if you disobey.""There are five of them" said Athos "and we are but three. We shall bebeaten and must die on the spot for on my part I will never face mycaptain as a conquered man."Athos Porthos and Aramis instantly closed in and Jussac drew up hissoldiers.In that short interval D'Artagnan determined on the part he was to takeit was a decision of life-long importance. He had to choose between theking and the cardinal and the choice made it must be persisted in. Heturned towards Athos and his friends. "Gentlemen" said he "allow me tocorrect your words. You said you were but three but it appears to me weare four. I do not wear the uniform but my heart is that of amusketeer.""Withdraw young man and save your skin" cried Jussac.The three musketeers thought of D'Artagnan's youth and dreaded hisinexperience."Try me gentlemen" said D'Artagnan "and I swear to you that I willnever go hence if we are conquered."Athos pressed the young man's hand and exclaimed "Well then AthosPorthos Aramis and D'Artagnan forward"The nine combatants rushed upon each other with fury and the battleended in the utter discomfiture of the cardinal's guards one of whomwas slain and three badly wounded. The musketeers returned walking armin arm. D'Artagnan marched between Athos and Porthos his heart full ofdelight."If I am not yet a musketeer" said he to his new friends "at least Ihave entered upon my apprenticeship haven't I"_II.--The Queen's Diamonds_The king always jealous of Richelieu's guards was extremely pleasedwhen he heard from M. de Treville of the fight that had taken place. Hegave D'Artagnan a handful of gold and promised him a place in the ranksof the musketeers at the first vacancy in the meantime he was to join acompany of royal guards. From this time the life of the four young menbecame common for D'Artagnan fell quite easily into the habits of histhree friends.Athos who was scarcely thirty years old was of great personal beauty
comment569,and intelligence of mind. He never spoke of women he never laughedrarely smiled and his reserved and silent habits seemed to make him amuch older man.Porthos was exactly the opposite of Athos. He not only talked much buthe talked loudly not caring whether anyone listened to him. He wouldtalk about anything except the sciences alleging that from childhooddated his inveterate hatred of learning. The physical strength ofPorthos was enormous and with all the vanity of a child he was athoroughly loyal and brave man.As for Aramis he always gave out that he intended to take orders in theChurch and was merely a musketeer for the time being. Aramis revelledin intrigues and mysteries.What the real names of his comrades were D'Artagnan had no idea. Thatthe names they bore had been assumed was all he knew.The motto of the four was "all for one one for all." D'Artagnan hadalready earned the dislike of Cardinal Richelieu by his part in thefight with the cardinal's guards it was not long before his daring gavegreater cause for offence.The king suspected his wife Anne of Austria of being in love with theDuke of Buckingham and the cardinal suspected the queen of intriguingwith Buckingham against France. Now a secret interview had taken placeat the palace between Buckingham and the queen and the cardinal whoemployed spies everywhere found out this as he found out everythingand determined to destroy the queen's reputation for there was deadlyenmity between Anne of Austria and Richelieu.Buckingham had received from the queen a set of diamond studs--a presentfrom the king--as a keepsake so the cardinal despatched a certain ladya woman of rare beauty known as "Milady" to England to get hold oftwo of these studs.Then the cardinal by fostering the royal suspicion persuaded the kingto give a grand ball whereat the queen should wear the diamond studs. Bythis means Louis would be convinced of Buckingham's visit for the setof studs would be incomplete.The queen was in dispair. It was D'Artagnan and the three musketeerswho saved her honour. D'Artagnan loved Madame Bonacieux a confidentialdressmaker of the queen's and this woman devoted to her royalmistress gave D'Artagnan a secret note from the queen to Buckingham.D'Artagnan went at once to M. de Treville obtained leave of absence forhimself and his friends and set out for England. It was not a minutetoo soon for the cardinal had already made plans to prevent any suchcounter-move giving orders that no one was to sail from France withouta permit.Between Paris and Calais Porthos Aramis and Athos were all leftbehind wounded by Richelieu's guards and D'Artagnan only effected apassage to Dover by fighting and nearly killing a young noble who held apermit from the cardinal to leave France.Once in England D'Artagnan hastened to find Buckingham. The latterdiscovered to his horror that Milady had already become possessedcunningly of two of the precious studs and D'Artagnan had to wait whilethe skill of the first English jeweller made good the loss beyonddetection.He returned to Paris with the twelve studs in time for the royal ball.Milady had already given the two she had stolen to the cardinal who hadpassed them on to the king."What does this mean Monsieur le Cardinal" said the king severelywhen in the middle of the ball he found to his joy that the queen wasalready wearing twelve diamonds."It means sire" the cardinal replied with vexation "that I wasanxious to present her majesty with two studs but did not dare to offer
comment570,them myself.""I am very grateful" said Anne of Austria fully alive to thecardinal's defeat "only I am afraid these two studs must have cost youreminence as much as all the others cost his majesty."The man D'Artagnan to whom the queen owed this extraordinary triumphover her enemy stood unknown in the crowd that gathered round thedoors. It was only when the queen retired that someone touched him onthe shoulder and bade him follow. He readily obeyed D'Artagnan waitedin an ante-room of the queen's apartments he could hear voices withinand presently a hand and an arm marvellously white and beautiful camethrough the tapestry.D'Artagnan felt that this was his reward. He dropped on his kneesseized the hand and touched it modestly with his lips. Then the handwas withdrawn and in his own a ring was left. The tapestry closed andhis guide no other than Bonacieux reappeared and escorted him hastilyto the corridor._III.--The Musketeers at La Rochelle_The siege of La Rochelle was an important affair one of the chiefpolitical events of the reign of Louis XIII.For a time D'Artagnan was separated from his friends for the musketeerswere escorting the king to the seat of war and our intrepid Gascon waswith the main army. It was now that D'Artagnan began to realise that hehad attracted not only the displeasure of the cardinal but also thedeadly hatred of Milady the cardinal's secret agent whose overtures atfriendship made in the cardinal's interest he had insulted beforeleaving Paris and whose secret shame he had discovered.Twice his life was nearly taken by hired assassins and the third time apresent of wine turned out to be poisoned.To add to his natural discomfort Madame Bonacieux had disappeared fromParis and probably was in prison.The arrival of the musketeers restored his spirits and the four wereagain inseparable. One drawback to their intercourse was the fact thatthe cardinal and his spies were all over the camp and thatconsequently it was difficult to talk confidentially without beingoverheard.In order to secure privacy for a conference they decided to go andbreakfast in a bastion near the enemy's lines and wagered with someofficers they would stay there an hour. It was a position of terribledanger but the feat was accomplished and the wild undertaking of themusketeers was acclaimed with tremendous enthusiasm in the French camp.The noise reached the cardinal's ears and he inquired its meaning."Monseigneur" said the officer "three musketeers and a guard laid awager that they would go and breakfast in the Bastion St. Gervais andthey breakfasted and held it for two hours against the enemy killing I
comment571,don't know how many Rochellais.""Did you inquire the names of those three musketeers""Yes monseigneur. MM. Athos Porthos and Aramis.""Still the three braves" muttered the cardinal. "And the guard""M. D'Artagnan""Still my reckless young friend I must have these four men as my own."That same night the cardinal spoke to M. de Treville of the episode ofthe bastion and gave permission for D'Artagnan to become a musketeer"for such men should be in the same company" he said.One night during the siege the three musketeers seeking D'Artagnanwere met in a country lane by the cardinal travelling as he often didwith a single attendant. Athos recognised him and the cardinal bade thethree men escort him to a lonely inn. At the door they all alighted. Thelandlord of the inn received the cardinal for he had been expecting anofficer to visit a lady who was within. The three musketeers wereaccommodated in a large room on the ground floor and the cardinalpassed up the staircase as a man who knew his road. Porthos and Aramissat down at the table to dice while Athos walked up and down the roomin a thoughtful mood. To his astonishment Athos found that thestovepipe being broken he could hear all that was passing in the roomabove."Listen Milady" the cardinal was saying "this affair is of utmostimportance. A small vessel is waiting for you at the mouth of the river.You will go on board to-night and set sail to-morrow morning forEngland. Half an hour after I have gone you will leave here. When youreach England you will seek the Duke of Buckingham explain to him thatI have proofs of his secret interviews with the queen and tell him thatif England moves in support of the besieged in La Rochelle I will atonce ruin the queen.""But what if he persists in spite of this in making war" said Milady."If he persists Why then he must be got rid of. Some woman doubtlessexists handsome young and clever who has a grievance against theduke and some fanatic can be found to be her instrument.""The woman exists and the fanatic will be found" returned Milady. "Andnow will monseigneur permit me to speak of my enemies as we havespoken of yours""Your enemies Who are they" asked Richelieu."First there is a meddlesome little woman called Bonacieux. She was inprison at Nantes but has been conveyed to a convent by an order whichthe queen obtained from the king. Will your eminence find out where thatconvent is""I don't object to that.""Then I have a much more dangerous enemy than the little Bonacieux andthat is her lover the wretch D'Artagnan. I will get you a thousandproofs that he has conspired with Buckingham.""Very well get me proof and I will send him to the Bastille."For a few seconds there was silence while the cardinal was writing anote.Athos at once got up and told his companions he would go out to see ifthe road was safe and left the house.The cardinal gave his final instructions to Milady and departed withPorthos and Aramis. No sooner had they turned an angle of the road thanAthos re-entered the inn marched boldly upstairs and before he hadbeen seen had bolted the door.Milady turned round and became exceedingly white."The Count de la Fre" she said."Yes Milady the Count de la Fre in person. You believed him dead didyou not as I believed you to be""What do you want Why do you come here" said Milady in a hollow voice."I have followed your actions" said Athos sternly. "It was you who hadMadame Bonacieux carried off it was you who sent assassins afterD'Artagnan and poisoned his wine. Only to-night you have agreed toassassinate the Duke of Buckingham and expect D'Artagnan to be slain in
comment572,return. Now I care nothing about the Duke of Buckingham he is anEnglishman but D'Artagnan is my friend.""M. D'Artagnan insulted me" said Milady."Is it possible to insult you" said Athos. He drew out a pistol andcocked it. "Madame you will instantly deliver to me the paper you havereceived from the cardinal or upon my soul I will blow out yourbrains."Athos slowly raised his pistol until the weapon almost touched thewoman's forehead. Milady knew too well that with this terrible man deathwould certainly come unless she yielded. She drew the paper out of herbosom and handed it to Athos. "Take it" she said "and be accursed."Athos returned the pistol to his belt unfolded the paper and read      It is by my order and for the good of the state that the     bearer of this has done what he has done.     Dec. 3rd 1627.     RICHELIEU.Athos without looking at the woman left the inn mounted his horseand galloping across country managed to get in front on the roadbefore the cardinal had passed.For a second Milady thought of pursuing the cardinal in order todenounce Athos but unpleasant revelations might be made and it seemedbest to carry out her mission in England and then when she hadsatisfied the cardinal to claim her revenge._IV.--The Doom of Milady_Milady accomplished the assassination of the Duke of Buckingham atPortsmouth and Richelieu was relieved of the fear of Englishintervention at La Rochelle.But the doom of Milady was at hand.The king weary of the siege had gone to spend a few days quietly atSt. Germains taking for an escort only twenty of the musketeers and atParis the four friends had obtained from M. de Treville a few days'leave of absence.Aramis had discovered the convent where Madame Bonacieux was confinedit was at Bethune and thither the musketeers hastened. UnfortunatelyMilady reached Bethune first. She had come there to await the cardinal'sorders and having ingratiated herself with the abbess learnt thatD'Artagnan was on his way with an order from the queen to take MadameBonacieux to Paris. Milady immediately dispatched a messenger to thecardinal and at the very moment when the musketeers were at the frontentrance she poured a powder into a glass of wine and bade MadameBonacieux drink."It is not the way I meant to avenge myself" said Milady as shehastily left the convent by the back gate "but _ma foi_ we do what wemust"The deadly poison did its work. Constance Bonacieux expired inD'Artagnan's arms.Then the four musketeers joined by Lord de Winter who had arrived fromEngland in hot pursuit of Milady his sister-in-law set out to overtakethe woman who had wrought so much evil.They came up with Milady at a solitary house near the village ofErquinheim.The four servants of the musketeers guarded the house AthosD'Artagnan Aramis Porthos and De Winter entered."What do you want" screamed Milady."We want Charlotte Backson first called Countess de la Fre andafterwards Lady de Winter" said Athos. "M. D'Artagnan it is for you toaccuse her first.""I accuse this woman of having poisoned Constance Bonacieux and ofhaving attempted to poison me and I accuse her of having engagedassassins to shoot me" said D'Artagnan."I accuse this woman of having procured the assassination of the Duke ofBuckingham" said Lord de Winter. "Moreover my brother who made herhis heiress died suddenly of a strange disease.""I married this woman and gave her my name and wealth and foundafterwards she was branded as a felon" said Athos.
comment573,The musketeers and Lord de Winter passed sentence of death upon themiserable woman.She was taken out to the river bank and beheaded and her body droppedinto the middle of the stream."Let the justice of Heaven be done" they cried in a loud voice.Within three days the musketeers were back in Paris ready to returnwith the king to La Rochelle. Then the cardinal summoned D'Artagnan tohis presence."You are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of Francewith having surprised state secrets and with having attempted to thwartthe plans of your general" said the cardinal."The woman who charges me--a branded felon--Milady de Winter is dead"replied D'Artagnan."Dead" exclaimed the cardinal. "Dead""We have tried her and condemned her" said D'Artagnan. Then he told thecardinal of the poisoning of Madame Bonacieux and of the subsequenttrial and execution.The cardinal shuddered before he answered quietly "You will be triedand condemned.""Monseigneur" said D'Artagnan "though I have the pardon in my pocket Iam willing to die.""What pardon" said the cardinal in astonishment. "From the king""No a pardon signed by your eminence." D'Artagnan produced the preciouspaper which Athos had forced Milady to give him before her journey toEngland.For a time the cardinal sat looking at the paper before him. Then heslowly tore it up."Now I am lost." thought D'Artagnan. "But he shall see how a gentlemancan die."The cardinal went to a table and wrote a few lines on a parchment."Here monsieur" he said "I have taken away from you one paper I giveyou another. Only the name is wanting in this commission and you mustfill that up."D'Artagnan took the document with hesitation. He looked at it saw itwas a lieutenant's commission in the musketeers and fell at thecardinal's feet."Monseigneur my life is yours. Dispose of it as you will. But I do notdeserve this. I have three friends all more worthy----"The cardinal interrupted him."You are a brave young man D'Artagnan. Fill up this commission as youwill."D'Artagnan sought out his friends and offered the commission to them inturn.But each declined and Athos filled in the name of D'Artagnan on thecommission."I shall soon have no more friends. Nothing but bitter recollections"said D'Artagnan thinking of Madame Bonacieux."You are young yet" Athos answered. "In time these bitter recollectionswill give way to sweet remembrances."                                   Twenty Years After      In this first-rate romance which is a sequel to "The Three     Musketeers" and was published in 1845 we have D'Artagnan and     the three musketeers in the prime of middle life. Their
comment574,     efforts on behalf of Charles I. are amazing worthy of     anything done when they were twenty years younger. All the     characters introduced are for the most part historical and     they are all drawn with spirit so that our interest in them     never flags. A remarkable point in regard to these historical     romances of Dumas is that in spite of their enormous length     no superfluous dialogue or long descriptions prolong them.     Dumas took considerable liberties with the facts of history in     several places as for instance in the introduction of     D'Artagnan and his friends to Charles I. and in making his     trial and execution follow as quickly on his surrender as we     are made to believe in "Twenty Years After." The story is     further continued in "The Vicomte de Bragelonne."_I.--The Parsimony of Mazarin_The great Richelieu was dead and his successor Cardinal Mazarin acunning and parsimonious Italian was chief minister of France. Paristorn and distracted by civil dissension and impoverished by heavytaxation was seething with revolt and Mazarin was the object ofpopular hatred Anne of Austria the queen-mother for Louis XIV. wasbut a child sharing his disfavour with the people.It was under these circumstances that the queen recalled how faithfullyD'Artagnan had once served her and reminded Mazarin of that gallantofficer and of his three friends. Mazarin sent for D'Artagnan who fortwenty years had remained a lieutenant of musketeers and asked him whathad become of his friends."I want you and your three friends to be of use to me" said thecardinal. "Where are your friends""I do not know my lord. We parted company long ago all three have leftthe service.""Where can you find them then""I can find them wherever they are. It would be my business.""And what are the conditions for finding them""Money my lord as much money as the undertaking may require.Travelling is dear and I am only a poor lieutenant in the musketeers.""You will be at my service when they are found" asked Mazarin."What are we to do""Don't trouble about that. When the time for action arrives you shalllearn all that I require of you. Wait till that comes and find outwhere your friends are."Mazarin gave D'Artagnan a bag of money and the latter withdrew todiscover in the courtyard that the bag contained silver and not gold."Crown pieces only silver" exclaimed D'Artagnan "I guessed as much.Ah Mazarin Mazarin you have no real confidence in me. So much theworse for you"But the cardinal was rubbing his hands and congratulating himself thathe had discovered a secret for a tenth of the coin Richelieu would havespent on the matter.D'Artagnan first sought for Aramis who was now an abb and lived in aconvent and wrote sermons. But the heart of Aramis was not in religionand when D'Artagnan found him and the two had sat talking for sometime D'Artagnan said "My friend it seems to me that when you were amusketeer you were always thinking of the Church and now that you arean abb you are always longing to be a musketeer.""It's true" said Aramis. "Man is a strange bundle of inconsistencies.Since I became an abb I dream of nothing but battles and I practiseshooting all day long here with an excellent master."Aramis indeed had both retained his swordsmanship and his interest in
comment575,public affairs. But when D'Artagnan mentioned Mazarin and the seriouscrisis in the state Aramis declared that Mazarin was an upstart withonly the queen on his side and that the young king the nobles andprinces were all against him. Aramis was already on the side ofMazarin's enemies. He could not pledge himself to anyone and the twoseparated.D'Artagnan went on to find Porthos whose address he had learnt fromAramis. Porthos who now called himself De Valon after the name of hisestate lived at ease as a country gentleman should he was a widowerand wealthy but he was mortified because his neighbours were of ancientfamily and ignored him. He received D'Artagnan with open arms and whenat breakfast he confessed his weariness D'Artagnan at once invited himto join him again and promised that he would get a barony for hisservices."Go into harness again" cried D'Artagnan. "Gird on your sword and wina coronet. You want a title I want money the cardinal wants our help.""For my part" said the gigantic Porthos "I certainly want to be made abaron."They talked of Athos who lived on his estate at Bragelonne and was nowthe Count de la Fre. And Porthos mentioned that Athos had an adoptedson."If we can get Athos all will be well" said D'Artagnan. "If we cannotwe must do without him. We two are worth a dozen.""Yes" said Porthos smiling at the remembrance of their old exploits"but we four would be equal to thirty-six.""I have your word then" said D'Artagnan."Yes. I will fight heart and soul for the cardinal but--but he mustmake me a baron.""Oh that's settled already" said D'Artagnan. "I'll answer for yourbarony."With that he had his horse saddled and rode on to the castle ofBragelonne. Athos was visibly moved at the sight of D'Artagnan andrushed towards him and clasped him in his arms. D'Artagnan equallymoved held him closely while tears stood in his eyes. Athos seemedscarcely aged at all in spite of his eight-and-forty years but therewas a greater dignity about his face. Formerly too he had been a heavydrinker but now no signs of excess disturbed the calm serenity of hiscountenance. The presence of his son whom he called Raoul--a boy offifteen--seemed to explain to D'Artagnan the regenerated existence ofAthos.Deeply as the heart of Athos was stirred at meeting his oldcomrade-in-arms and sincere as his attachment was to D'Artagnan theCount de la Fre would have nothing to do with any plan for helpingMazarin.D'Artagnan returned alone to await Porthos in Paris. The same nightAthos and his son also left for Paris._II.--The Four Set Out for England_Queen Henrietta of England daughter of Henry IV. of France and wife ofKing Charles I. was lodged in the Louvre while her husband lost hiscrown in the civil war. The queen had appealed to Mazarin either to sendassistance to Charles I. or to receive him in France and the cardinalhad declined both propositions. Then it was that an Englishman Lord deWinter who had come to Paris to get help appealed to Athos whom hehad known twenty years earlier to come to England and fight for theking.Athos and Aramis at once responded and waited on the queen whoreceived them in the large empty rooms--left unfurnished by the avariceof the cardinal--allotted to her in the Louvre.
comment576,"Gentlemen" said the queen "a few years ago I had around me knightstreasure and armies. To-day look around and know that in order toaccomplish a plan which is dearer to me than life I have only Lord deWinter the friend of twenty years and you gentlemen whom I see forthe first time and whom I know but as my countrymen.""It is enough" said Athos bowing low "if the life of three men canpurchase yours madame.""I thank you gentlemen. But hear me. My husband King of England isleading so wretched a life that death would be a welcome exchange forhim. He has asked for the hospitality of France and it has been refusedhim.""What is to be done" said Athos. "I have the honour to inquire fromyour majesty what you desire Monsieur D'Herblay as Aramis was namedand myself to do in your service. We are ready.""I madame" said Aramis "follow M. de la Fre wherever he leads evento death without demanding any reason but when it concerns yourmajesty's service no one precedes me.""Well then gentlemen" said the queen "since it is thus and sinceyou are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princesswhom everybody has forsaken this is what must be done for me. The kingis alone with a few gentlemen whom he may lose any day and he issurrounded by the Scotch whom he distrusts. I ask much too muchperhaps for I have no title to ask it. Go to England join the king behis friends his bodyguard be with him on the field of battle and inhis house. Gentlemen in exchange I can only promise you my love nextto my husband and my children and before everyone else you will havemy prayers and a sister's love.""Madame" said Athos "when must we set out we are ready"The queen moved to tears held out her hand which they kissed andthen after receiving letters for the king they withdrew."Well" said Aramis when they were alone "what do you think of thisbusiness my dear count""Bad" replied Athos. "Very bad""But you entered on it with enthusiasm.""As I shall ever do when a great principle is to be defended. Kings areonly strong by the aid of the aristocracy but aristocracy cannot existwithout kings. Let us then support monarchy in order to supportourselves.""We shall be murdered there" said Aramis. "I hate the English--they areso coarse like all people who drink beer.""Would it be better to remain here" said Athos. "And take a turn in theBastille by the cardinal's order Believe me Aramis there is littleleft to regret. We avoid imprisonment and we take the part of heroes--the choice is easy"While Athos and Aramis were preparing to go to England on behalf of theking Mazarin had decided to employ D'Artagnan and Porthos as his envoysto Oliver Cromwell."Monsieur D'Artagnan" said the cardinal "do you wish to become acaptain""Yes my lord.""Your friend wishes to be made a baron""At this very moment my lord he's dreaming that he is one.""Then" said Mazarin "take this dispatch carry it to England and whenyou get to London tear off the outer envelope.""And on our return may we my friend and I rely on getting ourpromotion--he his barony I my captaincy""On the honour of Mazarin yes.""I would rather have another sort of oath than that" said D'Artagnan to
comment577,himself as he went out.Just as they were leaving Paris a letter came from Athos who hadalready gone."Dear D'Artagnan dear Porthos--My friends perhaps this is the lasttime you will hear from me. I entrust certain papers which are atBragelonne to your keeping if in three months you do not hear of metake possession of them. May God and the remembrance of our friendshipsupport you always.--Your devoted friend Athos."_III.--In England_Athos and Aramis were with Charles I. at Newcastle. The king had beensold by the Scotch to the English Parliament and on the approach ofCromwell's army the king's troops refused to fight. Only fifteen menstood round the king when Cromwell's cavalry came charging down. Lord deWinter was shot dead by his own nephew who was in Cromwell's army."Come Aramis now for the honour of France" said Athos and the twoEnglishmen who were nearest to them fell mortally wounded.At the same instant a tremendous shout filled the air and thirty swordsflashed before them. Suddenly a man sprang out of the English ranksfell upon Athos wound his muscular arms round him and tearing hissword from him said in his ear "Silence Yield--you yield to me don'tyou"A giant from the English ranks at the same moment seized Aramis by thewrists who struggled in vain to get free."I yield myself prisoner" said Aramis giving up his sword to Porthos."D'Art----" exclaimed Athos but the musketeer covered his mouth withhis hand.The ranks opened. D'Artagnan held the bridle of Athos' horse andPorthos that of Aramis and they led their prisoners off the field."We are all four lost if you give the least sign you know us" saidD'Artagnan."The king--where is the king" Athos exclaimed anxiously."Ah We have got him""Yes" said Aramis "through a base act of treachery"Porthos pressed his friend's hand and answered "Yes all is fair inwar--stratagem as well as force. Look yonder"The squadron which ought to have protected the king was advancing tomeet the English regiments.The king who was entirely surrounded walked alone on foot. He caughtsight of Athos and Aramis and greeted them."Farewell messieurs. The day has been unfortunate but it is not yourfault thank God But where is my old friend Winter""Look for him with Strafford" said a voice.Charles shuddered. He saw a corpse at his feet. It was Winter's.That hour messengers were sent off in every direction over England andEurope to announce that Charles Stuart was now the prisoner of OliverCromwell. D'Artagnan not only accomplished the release of the prisonershe also joined with his friends in a bold attempt to rescue Charles fromhis captors.D'Artagnan at first naturally assumed they would all four return toFrance as quickly as possible but Athos declared that he could notabandon the king and still meant to save him if it were possible."But what can you do in a foreign land in an enemy's country" saidD'Artagnan. "Did you promise the queen to storm the Tower of LondonCome Porthos what do you think of this business"
comment578,"Nothing good" said Porthos."Friend" said Athos "our minds are made up Ah if we had you with usWith you D'Artagnan and you Porthos--all four and reunited for thefirst time for twenty years--we would dare not only England but thethree kingdoms together""Very well" cried D'Artagnan furiously "very well since you wish itlet us leave our bones in this horrible land where it is always coldwhere the fine weather comes after a fog and the fog after rain intruth whether we die here or elsewhere matters little since we mustdie sooner or later.""But your future career D'Artagnan Your ambition Porthos" saidAthos."Our future our ambition" replied D'Artagnan bitterly. "What do weneed to think of that for if we are to save the king The king savedwe shall assemble our friends together reconquer England and place himsecurely on the throne.""And he shall make us dukes and peers" said Porthos joyfully at thischeerful prospect."Or he will forget us" added D'Artagnan."Then" said Athos offering his hand to D'Artagnan "I swear to you myfriend by the God who hears us I believe there is a power watchingover us and I look forward to our all meeting in France again.""So be it" said D'Artagnan "but I confess I have quite a contraryconviction. However 'tis settled but I stay in England only on onecondition that I don't have to learn the language."The attempt to rescue Charles from his guards on the way to London wasonly frustrated by the sudden arrival of General Harrison with a largebody of soldiers and D'Artagnan and his friends made their escape by ahasty flight and followed to London."We must see this tragedy played out to the end" said Athos. "Do notlet us leave England while any hope remains."And the others agreed._IV.--At Whitehall_The intrepid four were present at the trial of Charles I. and it wasthe voice of Athos that called out "You lie" when the prosecutordeclared that the accusation against the king was put forward by theEnglish people.Fortunately D'Artagnan managed to get Athos out of the court quicklyand then followed by Porthos and Aramis they mingled in the crowdoutside undetected.Sentence having been pronounced against the king the only thing to bedone by the four was to get rid of the London executioner this meant atleast a few days delay while another executioner was being procured.D'Artagnan undertook this difficult task while Aramis was to personateBishop Juxon the royal chaplain and explain to Charles the attemptbeing made to save him. Athos engaged to get everything ready forleaving England.On the very night before the execution Aramis brought the king a messagefrom D'Artagnan "Tell the king that to-morrow at ten o'clock at nightwe shall carry him off." Aramis added "He has said it and he will doit."The scaffold was already being constructed in Whitehall as he spoke butD'Artagnan had the London executioner fast bound under lock and key in a
comment579,cellar and Athos had a light skiff waiting at Greenwich. Not only thisbut at midnight these four wonderful men thanks to Athos who spokeexcellent English were also at work at the scaffold--having bribed thecarpenter in charge to let them assist--and at the same time boring ahole in the wall. The scaffold which had two lower stories and wascovered with black serge was at the height of twenty feet on a levelwith the window in the king's room and the hole communicated with anarrow loft between the floor of the king's room and the ceiling ofthe one below it.The plan was to pass through the hole into the loft and cut out frombelow a piece of the flooring of the king's room so as to form a kindof trap-door. The king was to escape through this on the followingnight and hidden by the black covering of the scaffold was then tochange his dress for that of a workman and so pass the sentinels onduty and reach the skiff that was waiting for him at Greenwich.At nine o'clock in the morning Aramis this time in attendance on BishopJuxon was once more in the king's room."Sire" he said "you are saved The London executioner has vanishedand there is no executioner nearer at hand than Bristol. The Count de laFre is two feet below you take the poker from the fireplace andstrike three times on the floor. He will answer you. He has the pathready for your majesty to escape by."The king did as Aramis suggested and in reply came three dull knocksfrom below."The Count de la Fre" said Aramis.All was ready nothing as far as D'Artagnan and Athos could see hadbeen overlooked twenty-four hours hence would see the king beyond thereach of his adversaries.And then just as Charles had satisfied himself that his life was saveda Parliamentary officer and a file of soldiers entered the king's roomto announce his immediate execution."Then it is for to-day" asked the king."Were not you warned that it was to take place this morning""Then I must die like a common criminal by the hand of the Londonexecutioner""The London executioner has disappeared but a man has offered hisservices instead. The execution will therefore take place at theappointed hour."A fanatical Puritan nephew of Lord de Winter--whom he slew atNewcastle--and a trusted lieutenant of Cromwell's did the work of theheadsman and upon Athos waiting in concealment beneath the scaffoldfell drops of the king's blood.When all was over the four hastened away in deep dejection to the skiffat Greenwich and so to France. But when they had landed at Dunkirk itwas plain to D'Artagnan that their troubles were not yet at an end."Porthos and I were sent by Cardinal Mazarin to fight for Cromwellinstead of fighting for Cromwell we have served Charles I. that's notthe same thing at all."However D'Artagnan and Porthos on their return to Paris rendered suchsignal service to Mazarin and to the queen by guarding them from theviolence of the mob and by quelling a riot that D'Artagnan receivedhis commission as captain of musketeers and Porthos his barony.The four old friends met once more in Paris before they separated.Aramis was returning to his convent Athos and Porthos to their estates.As war had just broken out in Flanders D'Artagnan made ready to gothither.Then all four embraced with tears in their eyes. And after that theydeparted on their various ways not knowing whether they were ever tosee each other again.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The World's Greatest Books Vol IIIby Arthur Mee and J.A.

GEORG EBERSAn Egyptian Princess     Georg Moritz Ebers a great Orientalist and Egyptologist was     born in Berlin on March 1 1837 received his first     instruction at Keilhau in Thuringen then attended a college     at Quedlinburg and finally took up the study of law at     Gttingen University. In 1858 when his feet became lame he     abandoned this study and took up philology and archology.     After 1859 he devoted himself almost exclusively to     Egyptology. Having recovered from his long illness he visited     the most important European museums and in 1869 he travelled     to Egypt Nubia and Arabia. On his return he took the chair     of Egyptology at Leipzig University. He went back to Egypt in     1872 and discovered besides many other important     inscriptions the famous papyrus which bears his name. "An     Egyptian Princess" is his first important novel written     during his illness and published in 1864. It has gone through     numerous editions and has been translated into most European     languages. It was followed by several other similar works of     fiction of which "Serapis" achieved wide popularity. Ebers     died on August 7 1898._I.--The Royal Bride_A cavalcade of dazzling splendour was moving along the high road towardsBabylon. The embassy sent by Cambyses the mighty King of the East hadaccomplished its mission and now Nitetis the daughter of Amasis Kingof Egypt was on the way to meet her future spouse. At the head of thesumptuous escort were Bartja Cambyses' handsome golden-haired youngerbrother his kinsman Darius Croesus the dethroned King of Lydia andhis son Gyges Prexaspes the king's ambassador and Zopyrus the son ofMegabyzus a Persian noble.
comment587,A few miles before the gates of Babylon they perceived a troop ofhorsemen galloping towards them. Cambyses himself came to honour hisbride. His pale face framed by an immense black beard expressed greatpower and unbounded pride. Deep pallor and bright colour flitted byturns across the face of Nitetis as his fiery eyes fixed her with apiercing gaze. Then he waved a welcome sprang from his horse shookCroesus by the hand and asked him to act as interpreter. "She isbeautiful and pleases me well" said the king. And Nitetis who hadbegun to learn the language of her new home on the long journey blusheddeeply and began softly in broken Persian "Blessed be the gods whohave caused me to find favour in thine eyes."Cambyses was delighted with her desire to win his approbation and withher industry and intellect so different from the indolence and idlenessof the Persian women in his harem. His wonder and satisfaction increasedwhen after recommending her to obey the orders of Boges the eunuchwho was head over the house of women she reminded him that she was aking's daughter bound to obey the commands of her lord but unable tobow to a venal servant.Her pride found an echo in his own haughty disposition. "You have spokenwell. A separate dwelling shall be appointed you. I and no one elsewill prescribe your rules of life and conduct. Tell me now how mymessengers pleased you and your countrymen""Who could know the noble Croesus without loving him Who could fail toadmire the beauty of the young heroes your friends and especially ofyour handsome brother Bartja The Egyptians have no love for strangersbut he won all hearts."At these words the king's brows darkened he struck his horse so thatthe creature reared and then turning it quickly round he gallopedtowards Babylon. He decided in his mind to give Bartja the command of anexpedition against the Tapuri and to make him marry Rosana thedaughter of a Persian noble. He also determined to make Nitetis his realqueen and adviser. She was to be to him what his mother Kassandane hadbeen to Cyrus his great father. Not even Phdime his favourite wifehad occupied such a position. And as for Bartja "he had better takecare" he murmured "or he shall know the fate that awaits the man whodares to cross my path."_II.--The Plot_According to Persian custom a year had to pass before Nitetis couldbecome Cambyses' lawful wife but conscious of his despotic power hehad decided to reduce this term to a few months. Meanwhile he only saw
comment588,the fair Egyptian in the presence of his blind mother or of his sisterAtossa both of whom became Nitetis' devoted friends. Meanwhile Bogesthe eunuch sank in public estimation since it was known that Cambyseshad ceased to visit the harem and he began to conspire with Phdime asto the best way of ruining Nitetis who had come to love Cambyses withever growing passion.The Egyptian princess's happiness was seriously disturbed by the arrivalof a letter from her mother which brought her naught but sad news. Herfather Amasis had been struck with blindness on the very day she hadreached Babylon and her frail twin-sister Tachot after falling into aviolent fever was wasting away for love of Bartja whose beauty hadcaptured her heart at the time of his mission in Sais. His name had beeneven on her lips in her delirium and the only hope for her was to seehim again.Nitetis' whole happiness was destroyed in one moment. She wept andsighed until she fell asleep from sheer exhaustion. When her maidMandane came to put a last touch to her dress for the banquet she foundher sleeping and as there was ample time she went out into the gardenwhere she met the eunuch Boges. He was the bearer of good news. Mandanehad been brought up with the children of a Magian one of whom was nowthe high-priest Oropastes. Love had sprung up between her and hishandsome brother Gaumata and Oropastes who had ambitious schemes hadsent his brother to Rhag and procured her a situation at court so thatthey might forget one another. And now Gaumata had come and begged herto meet him next evening in the hanging gardens. Mandane consented aftera hard struggle.Boges hurried away with malicious pleasure in the near success of hisscheme. He met one of the gardeners whom he promised to bring some ofthe nobles to inspect a special kind of blue lily in which the gardenertook great pride. He then hurried to the harem to make sure that theking's wives should look their best and insisted upon Phdime paintingher face white and putting on a simple dark dress without ornamentexcept the chain given her by Cambyses on her marriage to arouse thepity of the Achmenid to which family she herself belonged.The eunuch's cunning scheme succeeded but too well. At the end of thegreat banquet Bartja to whom Cambyses had promised to grant a favour onhis victorious return from the war confessed to him his love forSappho a charming and cultured Greek maiden of noble descent whom hewished to make his wife. Cambyses was delighted at this proof of theinjustice of his jealous suspicions and announced aloud that Bartjawould in a few days depart to bring home a bride. At these wordsNitetis thinking of her poor sister's misery fainted.Cambyses sprang up pale as death his lips trembled and his fist wasclenched. Nitetis looked at him imploringly but he commanded Boges totake the women back to their apartments. "Sleep well Egyptian and prayto the gods to give you the power of dissembling your feelings. Heregive me wine but taste it well for to-day for the first time I fearpoison. Do you hear Egyptian Yes all the poison as well as themedicine comes from Egypt."Boges gave strict orders that nobody--not even the queen-mother orCroesus--was to have access to the hanging gardens whither he hadconducted Nitetis. Cambyses meanwhile continued the drinking boutthinking the while of punishment for the false woman. Bartja could havehad no share in her perfidy or he would have killed him on the spotbut he would send him away. And Nitetis should be handed to Boges to bemade the servant of his concubines and thus to atone for her crimes.When the king left the hall Boges who had slipped out before himintercepted one of the gardener's boys with a letter for Prince Bartja.The boy refused to hand it over as Nitetis had instructed him to hand
comment589,it only to the prince and on Cambyses' approach the boy fell on hisknees touching the ground with his forehead. Cambyses snatched thepapyrus roll from his hand and stamped furiously on the ground atseeing that the letter was written in Greek which he could not read. Hewent to his own apartments followed by Boges whom he instructed tokeep a strict watch over the Egyptian and the hanging gardens. "If asingle human being or a message reach her without my knowledge yourlife will be the forfeit."Boges pleading a burning fever begged that Kandaules the Lydiancaptain of eunuchs who was true as gold and inflexibly severe shouldrelieve him on the morrow. On the king's consent he begged furthermorethat Oropastes Croesus and three other nobles should be allowed towitness the opening of the blue lily in the hanging gardens. Kandauleswould see that they enter into no communication with the Egyptian."Kandaules must keep his eyes open if he values his own life--go"_III.--Conflicting Evidence_The hunt was over and Bartja who had invited his bosom friendsDarius Gyges Zopyrus and Croesus to drink a parting-cup with himsat with the first three in the bower of the royal gardens. They talkedlong of love of their ambitions of the influence of stars on humandestinies when Croesus rapidly approached the arbour. When he beheldBartja he stood transfixed then whispered to him "Unhappy boy youare still here Fly for your life The whip-bearers are close on myheels.""What do you mean""Fly I tell you even if your visit to the hanging gardens wasinnocently meant. You know Cambyses' violent temper. You know hisjealousy of you and your visit to the Egyptian to-night....""My visit I have never left this garden""Don't add a lie to your offense. Save yourself quickly.""I speak the truth and I shall remain.""You are infatuated. We saw you in the hanging-gardens not an hour ago."Bartja appealed to his friends who confirmed on oath the truth of hisassertion and before Croesus could arrive at a solution of the mysterythe soldiers had arrived led by an officer who had served under Bartja.He had orders to arrest everybody found in the suspect's company but atthe risk of his life urged Bartja to escape the king's fury. His menwould blindly follow his command. But Bartja steadfastly refused. He wasinnocent and knew that Cambyses though hasty was not unjust.Two hours later Bartja and his friends stood before the king who hadjust recovered from an epileptic fit. A few hours earlier he would havekilled Bartja with his own hands. Now he was ready to lend an ear toboth sides. Boges first related that he was with the Achmenid lookingat the blue lily and called Kandaules to inquire if everything was inorder. On being told that Nitetis had not tasted food or drink all dayhe sent Kandaules to fetch a physician. It was then that he saw Bartjaby the princess's window. She herself came out of the sleep-room.Croesus called to Bartja and the two figures disappeared behind acypress. He went to search the house and found Nitetis lying unconsciouson a couch. Hystaspes and the other nobles confirmed the eunuch's wordsand even Croesus had to admit their substantial truth but added thatthey must have been deceived by some remarkable likeness--at which Bogesgrew pale.Bartja's friends were equally definite in their evidence for theaccused. Cambyses looked first on the one then on the other party of
comment590,these strange witnesses. Then Bartja begged permission to speak."A son of Cyrus" he said "would rather die than lie. I confess nojudge was ever placed in so perplexing a position. But were the entirePersian nation to rise up against you and swear that Cambyses hadcommitted an evil deed and you were to say 'I did not commit it' IBartja would give all Persia the lie and exclaim 'Ye are all falsewitnesses A son of Cyrus cannot allow his mouth to deal in lies.' Iswear to you that I am innocent. I have not once set foot in the hanginggardens since my return."Cambyses' looks grew milder on hearing these words and when Oropastessuggested that an evil spirit must have taken Bartja's form to ruin himhe nodded assent and stretched out his hand towards Bartja. At thismoment a staff-bearer came in and gave the king a dagger found by aeunuch under Nitetis' window. Cambyses examined it dashed the daggerviolently to the ground and shrieked "This is your dagger At last youare convicted you liar Ah you are feeling in your girdle You maywell turn pale your dagger is gone Seize him put on his fetters Heshall be strangled to-morrow Away with you you perjured villains Theyshall all die to-morrow And the Egyptian--at noon she shall be floggedthrough the streets. Then I'll----"But here he was stopped by another fit of epilepsy and sank down inconvulsions.The fate of the unfortunates was sealed when afterwards Cambyses madeCroesus read to him Nitetis' Greek letter to Bartja."Nitetis daughter of Amasis of Egypt to Bartja son of the greatCyrus."I have something important to tell you I can tell it to no one butyourself. To-morrow I hope to meet you in your mother's rooms. It liesin your power to comfort a sad and loving heart and to give it onehappy moment before death. I repeat that I must see you soon."Croesus who tried to intercede on behalf of the condemned wassentenced to share their fate. In his heart even he was now convinced ofBartja's guilt and of the perjury of his own son and of Darius._IV.--The Unexpected Witness_Nitetis had passed many a wretched hour since the great banquet. All daylong she was kept in strict seclusion and in the twilight Boges came toher to tell her jeeringly that her letter had fallen into the king'shand and that its bearer had been executed. The princess swooned awayand Boges carried her to her sleeping-room the door of which he barredcarefully. When later Mandane left her lover Gaumata the maid hurried
comment591,into her mistress's room found her in a faint and used every remedy torestore her to consciousness.Then Boges came with two eunuchs loaded the princess's arms withfetters and gave vent to his long-nourished spite telling her of theawful fate that was in store for her. Nitetis resolved to swallow apoisonous ointment for the complexion directly the executioner shoulddraw near her. Then in spite of her fetters she managed to write toCambyses to assure him once more of her love and to explain herinnocence. "I commit this crime against myself Cambyses to save youfrom doing a disgraceful deed."Meanwhile Boges after exciting Phdime's curiosity by many vaguehints divulged to her the nature of his infamous scheme. When Gaumatahad come to Babylon for the New Year's festival Boges had discoveredhis remarkable likeness to Bartja. He knew of his love for Mandanegained his confidence and arranged the nocturnal meeting under Nitetis'bedroom window. In return he exacted the promise of the lover'simmediate departure after the meeting. He helped him to escape through atrap-door. To get Bartja out of the way he had induced a Greek merchantto dispatch a letter to the prince asking him in the name of her heloved best to come alone in the evening to the first station outsidethe Euphrates gate. Unfortunately the messenger managed the matterclumsily and apparently gave the letter to Gaumata. But to counteractBartja's proof of innocence Boges had managed to get hold of hisdagger which was conclusive evidence. And now Nitetis was sentenced tobe set astride upon an ass and led through the streets of Babylon. Asfor Gaumata three men were lying in wait for him to throw him into theEuphrates before he could get back to Rhagae. Phdime joined in Boges'laughter and hung a heavy jewel-studded chain round his neck.                                   A few hours only were wanted for the time fixed for Nitetis' disgraceand the streets of Babylon were thronged with a dense crowd ofsightseers when a small caravan approached the Bel gate. In the firstcarriage was a fine handsome man of about fifty of commanding aspectand dressed as a Persian courtier. With difficulty the driver cleared apassage through the crowd. "Make way for us The royal post has no timeto lose and I am driving some one who will make you repent everyminute's delay." They arrived at the palace and the stranger'sinsistence succeeded in gaining admission to the king. The Greek--forsuch the stranger had declared himself--affirmed that he could prove thecondemned men's innocence."Call him in" exclaimed Cambyses. "But if he wants to deceive me lethim remember that where the head of a son of Cyrus is about to fall aGreek head has but very little chance." The Greek's calm and noblemanner impressed Cambyses favourably and his hostility was entirelyovercome when the stranger revealed to him that he was Phanes thefamous commander of the Greek mercenaries in Egypt and that he had cometo offer his service to Cambyses.Phanes now related how on approaching Babylon by the royal post justbefore midnight they heard some cries of distress and found threefierce-looking fellows dragging a youth towards the river how with hisGreek war-cry he had rushed on the murderers slain one of them and putthe others to flight and how he discovered--so he thought--the youth tobe none other but Bartja whom he had met at the Egyptian court.They took him to the nearest station bled him and bound up his wounds.When he regained consciousness he told them his name was Gaumata. Thenhe was seized by fever during which he constantly spoke of the hanginggardens and of his Mandane."Set the prisoners free my king. I will answer for it with my own head
comment592,that Bartja was not in the hanging gardens."The king was surprised at this speech but not angry. Phanes thenadvised him to send for Oropastes and Mandane whose examinationelicited the full truth. Boges who was also sent for had disappeared.Cambyses had all the prisoners set free gave Phanes his hand to kiss--arare honour--and greater honour still invited him to eat at the king'stable. Then he went to the rooms of his mother who had sent for him.Nitetis had been carried insensible to the queen-mother's apartments.When she opened her eyes her head was resting on the blind queen's lapshe felt Atossa's warm kisses on her forehead and Cambyses was standingby her side. She gazed around and smiled as she recognised them one byone. She raised herself with difficulty. "How could you believe such athing of me my king" she asked. There was no reproach in her tone butdeep sadness Cambyses replied "Forgive me."Nitetis then gave them the letter she had received from her motherwhich would explain all and begged them not to scorn her poor sister."When an Egyptian girl once loves she cannot forget. But I feel sofrightened. The end must be near. That horrible man Boges read me thefearful sentence and it was that which forced the poison into my hand."The physician rushed forward. "I thought so She has taken a poisonwhich results in certain death. She is lost"On hearing this the king exclaimed in anguish "She _shall_ live it ismy will Summon all the physicians in Babylon. Assemble the priests. Sheis not to die She must live I am the king and I command it"Nitetis opened her eyes as if endeavouring to obey her lord. She lookedupon her lover who was pressing his burning lips to her right hand. Shemurmured with a smile "Oh this great happiness" Then she closed hereyes and was seized with fever.                                   All efforts to save Nitetis' life were fruitless. Cambyses fell into thedeepest gloom and wanted action war to dispel his sad thoughts.Phanes gave him the pretext. As commander of the Greek mercenaries inEgypt he had enjoyed Amasis' confidence. He alone with thehigh-priest shared Amasis' secret about the birth of Nitetus who wasnot the daughter of Amasis but of Hophra his predecessor whose throne
comment593,Amasis had usurped. When owing to the intrigues of Psamtik Amasis'son Phanes fell into disgrace and had to fly for his life his littleson was seized and cruelly murdered by his persecutors. Phanes had swornrevenge. He now persuaded Cambyses to wage war upon Egypt and to claimAmasis' throne as the husband of Hophra's daughter.The rest is known to all students of history--how Cambyses with thehelp of Phanes defeated Psamtik's host at Pelusium and took possessionof the whole Egyptian Empire how given more and more to drink andfearful excesses he set up a rule of untold terror had his brotherBartja murdered in another fit of jealousy and finally suffered defeatat the hands of the Ethiopians. They will also know how on his deathGaumata the "pseudo-Smerdis" of the Greeks was urged by his ambitiousbrother Oropastes to seize the throne by impersonating the deadBartja how finally the pretender was defeated and had to pay for hisattempt with his life and how Persia rose again to unity and greatnessunder the rule of the noble Darius Bartja's faithful kinsman andfriend.                                   MARIA EDGEWORTHBelinda     Maria Edgeworth was born at Black Bourton Oxfordshire     England Jan. 1 1767 and eleven years later her father     removed to Ireland and settled on his own estate at     Edgeworthstown. "Belinda" published in 1801 is Maria     Edgeworth's one early example of a novel not placed in Irish     surroundings but dealing with fashionable life. Issued just a     year after the appearance of her first Irish tale "Castle     Rackrent" it betrays entirely the influence of the novelist's     autocratic and eccentric father Richard Lovell Edgeworth     with whom the daughter had been previously collaborating. No     one could be less suited than he to advise about fiction yet     to his daughter his advice was almost the equivalent of a     command. The story is interesting as an example of literary     workmanship outside of the scenes in which special success had     been achieved. Miss Edgeworth died at Edgeworthstown on May     22 1849._I.--A Match-Maker's Handicap_Mrs. Stanhope a well-bred woman accomplished in the art of rising inthe world had with but a small fortune contrived to live in thehighest company. She prided herself upon having established half a dozennieces most happily--that is to say upon having married them to men offortunes far superior to their own. One niece still remained unmarriedBelinda Portman of whom she determined to get rid with all convenientexpedition but finding that owing to declining health she could notgo out with her as much as she wished she succeeded in fastening herupon the fashionable Lady Delacour for a winter in London."Nothing to my mind can be more miserable than the situation of a poorgirl who fails in her matrimonial expectations as many do merely fromnot beginning to speculate in time" she wrote from Bath. "She findsherself at five or six-and-thirty a burden to her friends destitute ofthe means of rendering herself independent--for the girls I speak ofnever think of _learning_ to play cards--_de trop_ in society yetobliged to hang upon all her acquaintances who wish her in heavenbecause she is unqualified to make the _expected_ return for civilitieshaving no home--I mean no establishment no house etc.--fit for thereception of company of certain rank. My dearest Belinda may this neverbe your case. I have sent your bracelet to you by Mr. Clarence Herveyan acquaintance of Lady Delacour an uncommonly pleasant young manhighly connected a wit and a gallant and having a fine independentfortune so my dear Belinda I make it a point--look well when he isintroduced to you and remember that nobody _can_ look well withouttaking some pains to please."Belinda had been charmed by Lady Delacour who was the most agreeablethe most fascinating person she had ever beheld and to be a visitor at
comment594,her house was a delightful privilege. But a short time after herarrival she began to see through the thin veil with which politenesscovers domestic misery. Abroad Lady Delacour appeared all spirit lifeand good humour at home listless fretful and melancholy a prey tothoughts seemingly of the most painful nature.The first time Belinda saw his lordship he was dead drunk in the arms oftwo footmen his lady who had just returned from Ranelagh passed himon the stairs with the utmost contempt."Don't look so shocked and amazed Belinda. Don't look so _new_ child.This funeral of my lord's intellects is to me a nightly ceremony or"said her ladyship looking at her watch and yawning "I believe I shouldsay a daily ceremony--six o'clock I protest"The next morning Clarence Hervey called and Belinda found him a mostuncommonly pleasant young man. Lord Delacour was jealous of him butalthough he would have started with horror at the idea of disturbing thepeace of a family in that family he said there was no peace todisturb. Consequently he visited her ladyship every day and every dayviewed Belinda with increasing admiration and with increasing dread ofbeing taken in to marry a niece of that "catch-matchmaker" as Mrs.Stanhope was known amongst the men of his acquaintance.Under the guise of a tragic muse--in which character Lady Delacour hadpretended she was going to a masquerade--Belinda heard his truesentiments with regard to her."You don't believe I go to Lady Delacour's to look for a wife Do youthink I'm an idiot Do you think I could be taken in by one of theStanhope school" he said to the facetious friends who rallied him onhis attachment. "Do you think I don't see as plainly as any of you thatBelinda Portman is a composition of art and affectation""Melpomene hast thou forgot thyself to warble" asked Lady Delacourtripping towards them as the comic muse."I am not very well" whispered Miss Portman. "Could we get away""Do see if you can find any of my people" cried Lady Delacour toClarence Hervey who had followed them downstairs."Lady Delacour the comic muse" exclaimed he. "I had thought----""No matter what you thought" interrupted her ladyship. "Let my carriagedraw up and put this lady into it" And he obeyed without uttering asyllable."Dry up your tears _keep on your mask_ and elbow your way through thecrowd" she said when she had heard Belinda's story. "If you stop to becivil and 'hope I don't hurt ye' you will be trod underfoot."She insisted on driving to the Panthon instead of going home but toBelinda the night seemed long and dull. The masquerade had no charm tokeep her thoughts from the conversation that had given her so much pain.
comment595,_II.--Fashion and Fortitude_"How happy you are Lady Delacour" she said when they got into thecarriage to go home. "How happy to have such an amazing flow ofspirits"And then she learnt the reason of her ladyship's strange unevenness oftemper. She was dying of an incurable complaint which she kept hiddenfrom all the world except her maid Marriott who attended on her in amysterious cabinet full of medicines and linen rags the door of whichshe had hitherto kept locked."You are shocked Belinda" said she "but as yet you have seen nothing.Look here" And baring one half of her bosom she revealed a hideousspectacle."Am I humbled Am I wretched enough" she asked. "No matter. I will dieas I have lived the envy and admiration of the world. Promise--swear tome that you will never reveal what you have seen to-night" And Belindapromised not only that but to remain with her as long as ever shewished.Belinda's quiet avoidance of Clarence Hervey made him begin to believethat she might not be "a compound of art and affectation" and he wasmortified to find that though she joined with ease and dignity in thegeneral conversation with the others her manner to him was grave andreserved. To divert her he declared he was convinced he was as wellable to manage a hoop as any woman in England except Lady Delacouraccordingly he was dressed by Marriott and made his _entree_ with verycomposed assurance and grace being introduced as the Countess dePomenars to the purblind dowager Lady Boucher who had come to call. Hemanaged his part well speaking French and broken English until LadyDelacour dexterously let down Belinda's beautiful tresses and callingthe French lady to admire _la belle chevelure_ artfully let fall hercomb.Totally forgetting his hoop and his character he stooped to pick it upand lost his wager by knocking over a music-stand. He would have liked alock of her hair but she refused with a modest graceful dignity shewas glad she had done so later when a tress of hair dropped from hispocket-book and his confusion showed her he was extremely interestedabout the person to whom it belonged.During her absence from the room Clarence entreated Lady Delacour tomake his peace with her. She consented on condition that he found her apair of horses from Tattersall's on which Belinda she said hadsecretly set her heart. He was vexed to find Belinda had so little
comment596,delicacy and relapsed into his former opinion of Mrs. Stanhope's nieceaddressing her with the air of a man of gallantry who thought his peacehad been cheaply made.The horses ran away with Lady Delacour injuring her ankle and on herbeing brought home by Clarence Lord Delacour wished to enter the lockedcabinet for _arque-busade._ On being denied entrance he seized the keybelieving a lover of hers was concealed there until Belinda sprangforward and took it from him leaving them to believe what they would.This circumstance was afterwards explained by Dr. X---- a mutualfriend and Hervey was so much charmed with Belinda that he would havegone to her at once--only that he had undertaken the reformation of LadyDelacour._III.--An Unexpected Suitor_In the meantime after spending a morning in tasting wines and thinkingthat although he had never learned to swim some recollection he had ofan essay on swimming would ensure his safety he betted his friends ahundred guineas that he would swim to a certain point and flinginghimself into the Serpentine would have drowned before their eyes butfor the help of Mr. Percival. The breach caused by this affair inducedSir Philip Baddely a gentleman who always supplied "each vacuity ofsense" with an oath to endeavour to cut him out by proposing toBelinda."Damme you're ten times handsomer than the finest woman I ever sawfor damme I didn't know what it was to be in love then" he saidheaving an audible sigh. "I'll trouble you for Mrs. Stanhope'sdirection Miss Portman I believe to do the thing in style I ought towrite to her before I speak to you."Belinda looked at him in astonishment and then finding he was inearnest assured him it was not in her power to encourage his addressesalthough she was fully sensible of the honour he had done her."Confusion seize me" cried he starting up "if it isn't the mostextraordinary thing I ever heard Is it to Sir Philip Baddely'sfortune--15000 a year--you object or to his family or to his personOh curse it" said he changing his tone "you're only quizzing me tosee how I should look--you do it too well you little coquette"Belinda again assured him she was entirely in earnest and that she wasincapable of the sort of coquetry which he ascribed to her. To punishher for this rejection he spread the report of Hervey's entanglementwith a beautiful girl named Virginia whose picture he had sent to anexhibition. He also roused Lady Delacour's jealousy into the belief thatBelinda meant to marry her husband the viscount after her death.In her efforts to bring husband and wife together Belinda had forgottenthat jealousy could exist without love and a letter from Mrs. Stanhopeexaggerating the scandalous reports in the hope of forcing her niece tomarry Sir Philip Baddely shocked her so much that when Lady Delacourquarrelled with her she accepted an invitation from Lady Anne Percival
comment597,and went there at once.There she became acquainted with Mr. Percival's ward Augustus Vincenta Creole about two-and-twenty tall and remarkably handsome withstriking manners and an engaging person who fixed his favourableattention on her. The Percivals would have wished her to marry him butshe still thought too much of Clarence Hervey to consent although shebelieved he had some engagement with the lovely Virginia._IV.--Explanation and Reconciliation_Quite unexpectedly a summons came from Lady Delacour and Belindareturned to her at once to find her so seriously ill that she persuadedher at last to consent to an operation and inform her husband of thedangerous disease from which she was suffering. He believed from herpreamble that she was about to confess her love for another man hetried to stop her with an emotion and energy he had never shown untilnow."I am not sufficiently master of myself. I once loved you too well tohear such a stroke. Say no more--trust me with no such secret you havesaid enough--too much. I forgive you that is all I can do but we mustpart Lady Delacour" said he breaking from her with agony expressed inhis countenance."The man has a heart a soul I protest You knew him better that I didMiss Portman. Nay you are not gone yet my lord You really love me Ifind.""No no no" cried he vehemently. "Weak as you take me to be LadyDelacour I am incapable of loving a woman who has disgraced medisgraced herself her--" His utterance failed."Oh Lady Delacour" cried Belinda "how can you trifle in this manner""I meant not" said her ladyship "to trifle I am satisfied. My lord Ican give you the most irrefragable proof that whatever may have been theapparent levity of my conduct you have had no serious cause forjealousy. But the proof will shock disgust you. Have you courage toknow more Then follow me."He followed her. Belinda heard the boudoir door unlocked. In a fewminutes they returned. Grief and horror and pity were painted on LordDelacour's countenance as he passed hastily out of the room."My dearest friend I have taken your advice would to heaven I hadtaken it sooner" said Lady Delacour. "I have revealed to Lord Delacourmy real situation. Poor man he was shocked beyond expression. Themoment his foolish jealousy was extinguished his love for me revived infull."Lady Delacour awaited the operation with the utmost fortitude but toeveryone's joy it was found there was no necessity for it she had beendeceived by a villainous quack who knew too well how to make a woundhideous and painful and had continued her delusion for his ownadvantage.Meanwhile Belinda having permitted Mr. Vincent to address her he wasbeing given a fair trial whether he could win her love. They had heardreports of Clarence Hervey's speedy marriage with an heiress MissHartley and found them confirmed by a letter Lady Delacour receivedfrom him. Some years ago he had formed the romantic idea of educating awife for himself and having found a beautiful artless girl in the NewForest he had taken her under his care on the death of her grandmother.She felt herself bound in honour and gratitude to him when her fortunechanged and she was acknowledged by her father Mr. Hartley who hadlong been searching for her and who had traced her at last by thepicture Clarence Hervey had caused to be exhibited.With the utmost magnanimity Hervey although he saw a successful rivalfor Belinda's hand in Augustus Vincent rescued him from ruin at the
comment598,gaming-table and induced him to promise never to gamble again."I was determined Belinda's husband should be my friend. I havesucceeded beyond my hopes" he said.But Vincent's love of play had decided Belinda at last. She refused himfinally in a letter which she confessed she found difficult to writebut which she sent because she had promised she would not hold him insuspense once she had made her decision.After this Virginia Hartley confessed to her attachment for one CaptainSunderland and Clarence was free to avow his passion for Belinda."And what is Miss Portman to believe" cried one of Belinda's friends"when she has seen you on the very eve of marriage with another lady""The strongest merit I can plead with such a woman as Miss Portman" hereplied "is that I was ready to sacrifice my own happiness to a senseof duty."                                   Castle Rackrent     "Castle Rackrent" was published anonymously in 1800. It was     not only the first of Miss Edgeworth's novels--it is in many     respects her best work. Later came "The Absentee" "Belinda"     "Helen" the "Tales of Fashionable Life" and the "Moral     Tales." Sir Walter Scott wrote that reading these stories of     Irish peasant life made him feel "that something might be     tempted for my own country of the same kind as that which Miss     Edgeworth so fortunately achieved for Ireland" something that     would procure for his own countrymen "sympathy for their     virtues and indulgence for their foibles." As a study of Irish     fidelity in the person of Old Thady the steward who tells the     story of "Castle Rackrent" the book is a masterpiece._I.--Sir Patrick and Sir Murtagh_Having out of friendship for the family undertaken to publish thememoirs of the Rackrent family I think it my duty to say a few wordsconcerning myself first. My real name is Thady Quirk though in thefamily I've always been known as "Honest Thady" afterwards I rememberto hear them calling me "Old Thady" and now I've come to "Poor Thady."To look at me you would hardly think poor Thady was the father ofAttorney Quirk he is a high gentleman and having better than fifteenhundred a year landed estate looks down upon honest Thady. But I washmy hands of his doings and as I lived so will I die true and loyal tothe family.I ought to bless that day when Sir Tallyhoo Rackrent lost a fine hunterand his life all in one day's hunt for the estate came straight into_the_ family upon one condition that Sir Patrick O'Shaughlin whosedriver my grandfather was should by Act of Parliament take thesurname and arms of Rackrent.Now it was the world could see what was in Sir Patrick. He gave thefinest entertainments ever was heard of in the country not a man couldstand after supper but Sir Patrick himself. He had his house from oneyear's end to another as full of company as it would hold and thiswent on I can't tell you how long.But one year on his birthday just as the company rose to drink hishealth he fell down in a sort of fit and in the morning it was allover with poor Sir Patrick.Never did any gentleman die more beloved by rich and poor. All thegentlemen in the three counties came to his funeral and happy the manwho could get but a sight of the hearseJust as they were passing through his own town the body was seized fordebt Little gain had the creditorsFirst and foremost they had the curses of the country and Sir Murtaghthe new heir refused to pay a shilling on account of the insult to hisfather's body in which he was countenanced by all the gentlemen ofproperty of his acquaintance. He did not take at all after the oldgentleman. The cellars were never filled and no open house even thetenants were sent away without their whiskey. I was ashamed myself butput it all down to my lady she was of the family of the Skinflints. I
comment599,must say she made the best of wives being a notable stirring womanand looking close to everything. 'Tis surprising how cheap my lady gotthings done What with fear of driving for rent and Sir Murtagh'slawsuits the tenants were kept in such good order they never came nearCastle Rackrent without a present of something or other--nothing toomuch or too little for my lady. And Sir Murtagh taught 'em all as hesaid the law of landlord and tenant. No man ever loved the law as hedid.Out of the forty-nine suits he had he never lost one but seventeen.Though he and my lady were much of a mind in most things there was adeal of sparring and jarring between them. In a dispute about anabatement one day my lady would have the last word and Sir Murtaghgrew mad. I was within hearing--he spoke so loud all the kitchen wasout on the stairs. All on a sudden he stopped and my lady too. SirMurtagh in his passion had broken a blood-vessel. My lady sent forfive physicians but Sir Murtagh died. She had a fine jointure settledupon her and took herself away to the great joy of the tenantry._II.--Sir Kit and his Wife_Then the house was all hurry-scurry preparing for my new master SirMurtagh's younger brother a dashing young officer. He came before Iknew where I was with another spark with him and horses and dogs andservants and harum-scarum called for everything as if he were in apublic-house. I walk slow and hate a bustle and if it had not been formy pipe and tobacco should I verily believe have broke my heart forpoor Sir Murtagh.But one morning my new master caught sight of me. "And is that OldThady" says he. I loved him from that day to this his voice was solike the family and I never saw a finer figure of a man.A fine life we should have led had he stayed among us God bless himBut the sporting season over he grew tired of the place and was offin a whirlwind to town. A circular letter came next post from the newagent to say he must remit 500 to the master at Bath within afortnight--bad news for the poor tenants. Sir Kit Rackrent my newmaster left it all to the agent and now not a week without a call formoney. Rents must be paid to the day and afore--old tenants turned outanything for the ready penny.The agent was always very civil to me and took a deal of notice of myson Jason who though he be my son was a good scholar from his birthand a very cute lad. Seeing he was a good clerk the agent gave him therent accounts to copy which he did for nothing at first being alwaysproud to serve the family.By-and-by a good farm fell vacant and my son put in a proposal for it.Why not The master knowing no more of the land than a child unbornwrote over leaving it to the agent and he must send over 200 byreturn post. So my son's proposal was just the thing and he a goodtenant and he got a promise of abatement after the first year foradvancing the half-year's rent to make up the 200 and my master wassatisfied. The agent told us then as a great secret that Sir Kit was alittle too fond of play.At last at Christmas the agent wrote he could raise no more moneyanyhow and desired to resign the agency. My son Jason who hadcorresponded privately with Sir Kit was requested to take over theaccounts forthwith. His honour also condescended to tell us he was goingto be married in a fortnight to the grandest heiress in England and hadimmediate occasion for 200 for travelling expenses home to CastleRackrent where he intended to be early next month. We soon saw hismarriage in the paper and news came of him and his bride being in
comment600,Dublin on their way home. We had bonfires all over the countryexpecting them all day and were just thinking of giving them up for thenight when the carriage came thundering up. I got the first sight ofthe bride and greatly shocked I was for she was little better than ablackamoor. "You're kindly welcome my lady" I says but neither spokea word nor did he so much as hand her up the steps.I concluded she could not speak English and was from foreign parts soI left her to herself and went down to the servants' hall to learnsomething about her. Sir Kit's own man told us at last that she mightwell be a great fortune for she was a Jewess by all accounts. I hadnever seen any of that tribe before and could only gather that shecould not abide pork nor sausages and went neither to church nor mass."Mercy upon his honour's poor soul" thought I. But when after thisstrange gentleman's servants came and began to talk about the bride Itook care to put the best foot foremost and passed her for a nabob.I saw plain enough next morning how things were between Sir Kit andhis lady though they went arm-in-arm to look at the building."Old Thady how do you do" says my master just as he used to do but Icould see he was not well pleased and my heart was in my mouth as Iwalked after them.There were no balls no dinners no doings. Sir Kit's gentleman told meit was all my lady's fault because she was so obstinate about thecross."What cross" says I. "Is it about her being a heretic""Oh no such matter" says he. "My master does not mind about herheresies but her diamond cross. She's thousands of English poundsconcealed in her diamonds which she as good as promised to give to mymaster before they married but now she won't part with any of them andmust take the consequences."One morning his honour says to me "Thady buy me a pig" and that wasthe first breaking out of my lady's troubles when the sausages wereordered. My lady went down to the kitchen herself and desired nevermore to see them on her table. The cook took her part but the mastermade it a principle to have the sausages so for fear of her place shegave in and from that day forward always sausages or pig-meat in oneform or other went up to table upon which my lady shut herself up inher own room and my master turned the key in the door and kept it everafter in his pocket. We none of us saw her or heard her speak for sevenyears after he carried her dinner in himself.Then his honour had a deal of company and was as gay and gallant asbefore he was married. The country to be sure talked and wondered butnobody cared to ask impertinent questions my master being a famousshot. His character was so well known that he lived in peace and quietever after and was a great favourite with the ladies so that when hegave out that my lady was now skin and bone and could not live throughthe winter there were no less than three ladies at daggers drawn ashis gentleman swore at the balls for Sir Kit for their partner. Icould not but think them bewitched but it was not known how my lady'sfortune was settled nor how the estate was all mortgaged and bonds outagainst him for he was never cured of his gaming tricks but that wasthe only fault he had God bless himThen it was given out by mistake that my lady was dead and the threeladies showed their brothers Sir Kit's letters and claimed hispromises. His honour said he was willing to meet any man who questionedhis conduct and the ladies must settle among themselves who was to behis second while his first was alive to his mortification and theirs.He met the first lady's brother and shot him next day called out the
comment601,second whose wooden leg stuck fast in the ploughed land so Sir Kitwith great candour fired over his head whereupon they shook handscordially and went home together to dinner.To establish his sister's reputation this gentleman went out as SirKit's second next day when he met the last of his adversaries. He hadjust hit the toothpick out of his enemy's hand when he received a ballin a vital part and was brought home speechless in a hand-barrow. Wegot the key out of his pocket at once and my son Jason ran to releaseher ladyship. She would not believe but that it was some new trick tillshe saw the men bringing Sir Kit up the avenue. There was no life inhim and he was "waked" the same night.The country was all in an uproar about him and his murderer would havebeen hanged surely but he prudently withdrew to the Continent.My lady got surprisingly well and no sooner was it known that Sir Kitwas dead than all the country came round in a body as it were to sether free. But she had taken an unaccountable prejudice against thecountry and was not easy but when she was packing up to leave us Iconsidered her quite as a foreigner and no longer part of the family.Her diamond cross was at the bottom of it all and it was a shame forher being his wife not to have given it up to him when he condescendedto ask for it so often especially when he made it no secret he hadmarried her for her money._III.--Sir Condy_The new heir Sir Conolly commonly called Sir Condy was the mostuniversally beloved man I ever saw or heard of. He was ever my white-headed boy when he used to live in a small but slated house at the endof the avenue before he went to college. He had little fortune of hisown and a deal of money was spent on his education. Many of the tenantssecretly advanced him cash upon his promising bargains of leases andlawful interest should he ever come into the estate. So that when he didsucceed he could not command a penny of his first year's income. My sonJason who was now agent explained matters to Sir Condy who notwilling to take his affairs in his own hands or even to look them inthe face gave my son a bargain of some acres at a reasonable rent topay him for his many years' service in the family gratis.There was a hunting-lodge convenient to my son's land that he had hiseye upon but Sir Condy talked of letting it to his friend CaptainMoneygawl with whom he had become very friendly and whose sister MissIsabella fell over head and ears in love with my master the first timehe went there to dinner.But Sir Condy was at a terrible nonplus for he had no liking for MissIsabella. To his mind little Judy McQuirk daughter to a sister's sonof mine was worth twenty of her. But her father had locked her in herroom and forbidden her to think of him which raised his spirit and Icould see him growing more and more in the mind to carry Miss Isabellaoff to Scotland as she desired. And I had wished her joy a week afteron her return with my poor master. Lucky for her she had a few thousandsof her own for her father would not give her a farthing. My master andmy lady set out in great style and it was reported that her father hadundertaken to pay all Sir Condy's debts and of course all thetradesmen gave him fresh credit and everything went on smack smooth. Iwas proud to see Castle Rackrent again in all its glory. She went on asif she had a mint of money and all Sir Condy asked--God bless him--wasto live in peace and quiet and have his whiskey punch at night. But mylady's few thousands could not last for ever. Things in a twelve-monthor so came to such a pass that there was no going on any longer.Well my son Jason put in a word about the lodge and Sir Condy was fainto take the purchase-money to settle matters for there were two writscome down against him to the sheriff who was no friend of his. Thenthere came a general election and Sir Condy was called upon by all hisfriends to stand candidate they would do all the business and it
comment602,should not cost him a penny.There was open house then at Castle Rackrent and grand dinners and allthe gentlemen drinking success to Sir Condy till they were carried off.The election day came and a glorious day it was. I thought I shouldhave died with joy in the street when I saw my poor master chaired andthe crowd following him up and down. But a stranger man in the crowdgets me to introduce him to my son Jason and little did I guess hismeaning. He gets a list of my master's debts from him and goes roundand buys them up and so got to be sole creditor over all and mustneeds have an execution against the master's goods and furniture.After the election shoals of people came from all parts claiming tohave obliged him with votes and to remind him of promises he nevermade. Worst of all the gentlemen who had managed everything andsubscribed by hundreds very genteelly forgot to pay and it was all leftat my master's door. All he could do to content 'em was to take himselfoff to Dublin where my lady had taken a house fitting for a member ofparliament.Soon my son Jason said "Sir Condy must look out for another agent. Ifmy lady had the Bank of Ireland to spend it would all go in onewinter."I could scarcely believe my own old eyes when I saw my son's name joinedin the _custodian_ that the villain who got the list of debts broughtdown in the spring but he said it would make it easier for Sir Condy._IV.--The Last of the Rackrents_When Sir Condy and his lady came down in June he was pleased to take measide to complain of my son and other matters not one unkind word of mylady but he wondered that her relations would do nothing for them intheir great distress. He did not take anything long to heart let it beas it might this night it was all out of his head before he went tobed. Next morning my lady had a letter from her relations and asked tobe allowed to go back to them. He fell back as if he was shot but aftera minute said she had his full consent for what could she do at CastleRackrent with an execution coming down Next morning she set off forMount Juliet.Then everything was seized by the gripers my son Jason to his shame beit spoken among them. On the evening Sir Condy had appointed to settleall when he sees the sight of bills and loads of papers on the tablehe says to Jason "Can't you now just sit down here and give me a clearview of the balance you know which is all I need be talking aboutThady do just step out and see they are bringing the things for thepunch." When I came back Jason was pointing to the balance a terriblesight for my poor master."A--h Hold your hand" cries my master. "Where in the wide world am Ito find hundreds let alone thousands""There's but one way" says Jason. "Sure can't you sell though at aloss Sure you can sell and I've a purchaser ready for you.""Have you so" says Sir Condy. Then colouring up a good deal he tellsJason of 500 a year he had settled upon my lady at which Jason wasindeed mad but with much ado agreed to a compromise. "And how much amI going to sell The lands of O'Shaughlin's town and the lands
comment603,of"--just reading to himself--"oh murder Jason Surely you won't putthis in--castle stables and appurtenances of Castle Rackrent""Oh murder" says I. "This is too bad Jason.""Why so" says Jason. "When it's all mine and a great deal more alllawfully mine was I to push for it"But I took no heed for I was grieved and sick at heart for my poormaster and couldn't but speak."Here's the punch" says Jason for the door opened.So my master starts up in his chair and Jason uncorks the whiskey.Well I was in great hopes when I saw him making the punch and mymaster taking a glass but Jason put it back when he saw him going tofill again saying "No Sir Condy let us settle all before we godeeper into the punch-bowl. You've only to sign" says Jason puttingthe pen to him."Take all and be content" said my master. So he signed and the manwho brought the punch witnessed for I was crying like a child.So I went out to the street door and the neighbours' children lefttheir play to come to see what ailed me and I told them all. When theyheard Sir Condy was going to leave Castle Rackrent for good and allthey set up such a whillaluh as brought all their parents round thedoors in great anger against Jason. I was frightened and went back towarn my son. He grew quite pale and asked Sir Condy what he'd best do."I'll tell you" says Sir Condy laughing to see his fright. "Finishyour glass first then let's go to the window and I'll tell them--oryou shall if you please--that I'm going to the lodge for change of airfor my health and by my own desire for the rest of my days.""Do so" says Jason who never meant it to be so but could not refuseat such a time.So the very next day he sets off to the lodge and I along with him.There was great bemoaning all through the town which I stayed towitness. He was in his bed and very low when I got there andcomplained of a great pain about his heart but I knowing the nature ofhim from a boy took my pipe and began telling him how he was belovedand regretted in the country. And it did him a great deal of good tohear it.There was a great horn at the lodge that used to belong to thecelebrated Sir Patrick who was reported to have drunk the full of itwithout stopping to draw breath which no other man afore or sincecould do.One night Sir Condy was drinking with the excise-man and the gauger andwagered that he could do it. Says he "Your hand is steadier than mineOld Thady fill you the horn for me." And so wishing his honoursuccess I did. He swallowed it down and dropped like one shot. We puthim to bed and for five days the fever came and went and came andwent. On the sixth he says knowing me very well "I'm in a burning painall withinside of me Thady." I could not speak. "Brought to this bydrink" says he. "Where are all the friends Gone hey Ay Sir Condyhas been a fool all his days" said he and died. He had but a very poor
comment604,funeral after all.                                   GEORGE ELIOTAdam Bede     Mary Ann Evans "George Eliot" was born Nov. 22 1819 at     South Farm Arbury Warwickshire England where her father     was agent on the Newdigate estate. In her youth she was adept     at butter-making and similar rural work but she found time to     master Italian and German. Her first important literary work     was the translation of Strauss's "Life of Jesus" in 1844 and     shortly after her father's death in 1849 she was writing in     the "Westminster Review." It was not until 1856 that George     Eliot settled down to the writing of novels. "Scenes from     Clerical Life" first appeared serially in "Blackwood's     Magazine" during 1857 and 1858 "Adam Bede" the first and     most popular of her long stories in 1859. In May 1880     eighteen months after the death of her friend George Henry     Lewes see PHILOSOPHY Vol. XIV George Eliot married Mr. J.     W. Cross. She died on December 22 in the same year. With all     her sense of humour there is a note of sadness in George     Eliot's novels. She deals with ordinary everyday people and     describes their joys and sorrows. In "Adam Bede" as in most     of her work the novelist drew from the ample stores of her     early life in the Midlands while the plot is unfolded with     singular simplicity purity and power._I.--The Two Brothers_In the roomy workshop of Mr. Jonathan Burge carpenter and builder inthe village of Hayslope on the eighteenth of June 1799 five workmenwere busy upon doors and window-frames.The tallest of the five was a large-boned muscular man nearly six feethigh. The sleeve rolled up above the elbow showed an arm that was likelyto win the prize for feats of strength yet the long supple hand withits broad finger tips looked ready for works of skill. In his tallstalwartness Adam Bede was a Saxon and justified his name. The face waslarge and roughly hewn and when in repose had no other beauty than suchas belongs to an expression of good-humoured honest intelligence.It is clear at a glance that the next workman is Adam's brother. He isnearly as tall he has the same type of features. But Seth's broadshoulders have a slight stoop and his glance instead of being keen isconfiding and benignant.The idle tramps always felt sure they could get a copper from Seth theyscarcely ever spoke to Adam.At six o'clock the men stopped working and went out. Seth lingered andlooked wistfully at Adam as if he expected him to say something."Shalt go home before thee go'st to the preaching" Adam asked."Nay I shan't be home before going for ten. I'll happen see DinahMorris safe home if she's willing. There's nobody comes with her fromPoyser's thee know'st."Adam set off home and at a quarter to seven Seth was on the villagegreen where the Methodists were preaching. The people drew nearer whenDinah Morris mounted the cart which served as a pulpit. There was atotal absence of self-consciousness in her demeanour she walked to thecart as simply as if she were going to market. There was no keenness inthe eyes they seemed rather to be shedding love than makingobservations. When Dinah spoke it was with a clear but not loud voiceand her sincere unpremeditated eloquence held the attention of heraudience without interruption.When the service was over Seth Bede walked by Dinah's side along thehedgerow path that skirted the pastures and corn-fields which laybetween the village and the Hall Farm.Seth could see an expression of unconscious placid gravity on herface--an expression that is most discouraging to a lover. He was timidlyrevolving something he wanted to say and it was only when they wereclose to the yard-gates of the Hall Farm he had the courage to speak."It may happen you'll think me overbold to speak to you again after whatyou told me o' your thoughts. But it seems to me there's more texts foryour marrying than ever you can find against it. St. Paul says 'Two arebetter than one' and that holds good with marriage as well as withother things. For we should be o' one heart and o' one mind Dinah. I'd
comment605,never be the husband to make a claim on you as could interfere with yourdoing the work God has fitted you for. I'd make a shift and fend indoorand out to give you more liberty--more than you can have now foryou've got to get your own living now and I'm strong enough to work forus both."When Seth had once begun to urge his suit he went on earnestly andalmost hurriedly. His voice trembled at the last sentence.They had reached one of those narrow passes between two tall stoneswhich performed the office of a stile in Loamshire. And Dinah pausedand said in her tender but calm notes "Seth Bede I thank you for yourlove towards me and if I could think of any man as more than aChristian brother I think it would be you. But my heart is not free tomarry or to think of making a home for myself in this world. God hascalled me to speak His word and He has greatly owned my work."They said farewell at the yard-gate for Seth wouldn't enter thefarmhouse choosing rather to turn back along the fields through whichhe and Dinah had already passed. It was ten o'clock when he reachedhome and he heard the sound of tools as he lifted the latch."Why mother" said Seth "how is it as father's working so late""It's none o' thy feyther as is a-workin' it's thy brother as doesiverything for there's niver nobody else i' th' way to do nothin'."Lisbeth Bede was going on for she was not at all afraid of Seth--whohad never in his life spoken a harsh word to his mother--and usuallypoured into his ears all the querulousness which was repressed by theawe which mingled itself with her idolatrous love of Adam.But Seth with an anxious look had passed into the workshop and said"Addy how's this What Father's forgot the coffin""Ay lad th' old tale but I shall get it done" said Adam looking up."Why what's the matter with thee--thee'st in trouble"Seth's eyes were red and there was a look of deep depression on hismild face."Yes Addy but it's what must be borne and can't be helped. Let metake my turn now and do thee go to bed.""No lad I'd rather go on now I'm in harness. The coffin's promised tobe ready at Brox'on by seven o'clock to-morrow morning. I'll call theeup at sunrise to help me to carry it when it's done. Go and eat thysupper and shut the door so as I mayn't hear mother's talk."Adam worked throughout the night thinking of his childhood and itshappy days and then of the days of sadness that came later when hisfather began to loiter at public-houses and Lisbeth began to cry athome. He remembered well the night of shame and anguish when he firstsaw his father quite wild and foolish.The two brothers set off in the early sunlight carrying the long coffinon their shoulders. By six o'clock they had reached Broxton and were ontheir way home.When they were coming across the valley and had entered the pasturethrough which the brook ran Seth said suddenly beginning to walkfaster "Why what's that sticking against the willow"They both ran forward and dragged the tall heavy body out of thewater and then looked with mute awe at the glazed eyes--forgettingeverything but that their father lay dead before them.Adam's mind rushed back over the past in a flood of relenting and pity.Only a few hours ago and the gray-haired father of whom he had beenthinking with a sort of hardness as certain to live to be a thorn in hisside was perhaps even then struggling with that watery death_II.--The Hall Farm_It is a very fine old place of red brick the Hall Farm--once theresidence of a country squire and the Hall.Plenty of life there though this is the drowsiest time of the yearjust before hay-harvest and it is the drowsiest time of the day toofor it is half-past three by Mrs. Poyser's handsome eight-day clock.Mrs. Poyser a good-looking woman not more than eight-and-thirty offair complexion and sandy hair well shaped light-footed had justtaken up her knitting and was seated with her niece Dinah Morris.Another motherless niece Hetty Sorrel a distractingly pretty girl of
comment606,seventeen was busy in the adjoining dairy."You look the image o' your aunt Judith Dinah when you sit a-sewing"said Mrs. Poyser. "I allays said that o' Judith as she'd bear a poundweight any day to save anybody else carrying a ounce. And it made nodifference in her as I could see when she took to the Methodists onlyshe talked a bit different and wore a different sort o' cap. If you'donly come and live i' this country you might get married to some decentman and there'd be plenty ready to have you if you'd only leave offthat preaching as is ten times worse than anything your Aunt Judithever did. And even if you'd marry Seth Bede as is a poorwool-gathering Methodist and's never like to have a penny beforehand Iknow your uncle 'ud help you with a pig and very like a cow for he'sallays been good-natur'd to my kin for all they're poor and made 'emwelcome to the house and 'ud do for you I'll be bound as much as everhe'd do for Hetty though she's his own niece."The arrival of Mr. Irwine the rector of Hayslope and CaptainDonnithorne Squire Donnithorne's grandson and heir interrupted Mrs.Poyser's flow of talk."I'll lay my life they're come to speak about your preaching on theGreen Dinah. It's you must answer 'em for I'm dumb. I've said enougha'ready about your bringing such disgrace upo' your uncle's family. Iwouldn't ha' minded if you'd been Mr. Poyser's own niece. Folks must putup wi' their own kin as they put up wi' their own noses it's their ownflesh and blood."Mr. Irwine however was the last man to feel any annoyance at theMethodist preaching and young Arthur Donnithorne's visit was merely anexcuse for exchanging a few words with Hetty Sorrel.The rector mentioned before he left that Thias Bede had been founddrowned in the Willow Brook and Dinah Morris at once decided that shemight be of some comfort to the widow and set out for the village.As for Hetty Sorrel she was thinking more of the looks CaptainDonnithorne had cast at her than of Adam and his troubles. Brightadmiring glances from a handsome young gentleman--those were the warmrays that set poor Hetty's heart vibrating.Hetty was quite used to the thought that people liked to look at her.She was aware that Mr. Craig the gardener at Squire Donnithorne's wasover head-and-ears in love with her. She knew still better that AdamBede--tall upright clever brave Adam Bede--who carried such authoritywith all the people round about and whom her uncle was always delightedto see of an evening saying that "Adam knew a fine sight more o' thenatur o' things than those as thought themselves his betters"--she knewthat this Adam who was often rather stern to other people and not muchgiven to run after the lassies could be made to turn pale or red anyday by a word or a look from her. Hetty's sphere of comparison was notlarge but she couldn't help perceiving that Adam was "something like" aman always knew what to say about things knew with only looking atit the value of a chestnut-tree that was blown down and why the dampcame in the walls and what they must do to stop the rats and wrote abeautiful hand that you could read and could do figures in his head--adegree of accomplishment totally unknown among the richest farmers ofthat country-side.Hetty was quite certain her uncle wanted her to encourage Adam andwould be pleased for her to marry him. For the last three years--eversince he had superintended the building of the new barn--Adam had alwaysbeen made welcome at the Hall Farm and for the last two years at leastHetty had been in the habit of hearing her uncle say "Adam Bede may beworking for a wage now but he'll be a master-man some day as sure as I
comment607,sit in this chair. Master Burge is in the right on't to want him to gopartners and marry his daughter if it's true what they say. The womanas marries him 'ull have a good take be't Lady Day or Michaelmas" aremark which Mrs. Poyser always followed up with her cordial assent."Ah" she would say "it's all very fine having a ready-made rich manbut may happen he'll be a ready-made fool and it's no use filling yourpocket full of money if you've got a hole in the corner. It'll do you nogood to sit in a spring-cart o' your own if you've got a soft to driveyou he'll soon turn you over into the ditch."But Hetty had never given Adam any steady encouragement. She liked tofeel that this strong keen-eyed man was in her power but as tomarrying Adam that was a very different affair.Hetty's dreams were all of luxuries. She thought if Adam had been richand could have given the things of her dreams--large beautiful earringsand Nottingham lace and a carpeted parlour--she loved him well enough tomarry him.The last few weeks a new influence had come over Hetty she had becomeaware that Mr. Arthur Donnithorne would take a good deal of trouble forthe chance of seeing her. And Dinah Morris was away preaching andworking in a manufacturing town._III.--Adam's First Love_Adam Bede like many other men thought the signs of love for anotherwere signs of love towards himself. The time had come to him thatsummer as he helped Hetty pick currants in the orchard of the HallFarm that a man can least forget in after-life--the time when hebelieves that the first woman he has ever loved is at least beginningto love him in return.He was not wrong in thinking that a change had come over Hetty theanxieties and fears of a first passion with which she was trembling hadbecome stronger than vanity and while Adam drew near to her she wasabsorbed in thinking and wondering about Arthur Donnithorne's possiblereturn.For the first time Hetty felt that there was something soothing to herin Adam's timid yet manly tenderness she wanted to be treated lovingly.And Arthur was away from home and oh it was very hard to bear theblank of absence. She was not afraid that Adam would tease her withlove-making and flattering speeches he had always been so reserved toher. She could enjoy without any fear the sense that this strong braveman loved her and was near her. It never entered into her mind that Adamwas pitiable too that Adam too must suffer one day.It was from Adam that she found out that Captain Donnithorne would beback in a day or two and this knowledge made her the more kindlydisposed towards him. But for all the world Adam would not have spokenof his love to Hetty yet till this commencing kindness towards himshould have grown into unmistakable love. He did no more than pluck arose for her and walk back to the farm with her arm in his.When Adam after stopping a while to chat with the Poysers had saidgood-night Mr. Poyser remarked "If you can catch Adam for a husbandHetty you'll ride i' your own spring-cart some day I'll be yourwarrant."Her uncle did not see the little toss of the head with which Hetty
comment608,answered him. To ride in a spring-cart seemed a very miserable lotindeed to her now.It was on August 18 when Adam going home from some work he had beendoing at one of the farms passed through a grove of beeches and sawat the end of the avenue about twenty yards before him two figures.They were standing opposite to each other with clasped hands and theyseparated with a start at a sharp bark from Adam Bede's dog. One hurriedaway through a gate out of the grove the other Arthur Donnithornelooking flushed and excited sauntered towards Adam. The young squirehad been home for some weeks celebrating his twenty-first birthday andhe was leaving on the morrow to rejoin his regiment.Hitherto there had been a cordial and sincere liking and a mutual esteembetween the two young men but now Adam stood as if petrified and hisamazement turned quickly to fierceness.Arthur tried to pass the matter off lightly as if it had been a chancemeeting with Hetty but Adam who felt that he had been robbedtreacherously by the man in whom he had trusted would not so easily lethim off. It came to blows and Arthur sank under a well-planted blow ofAdam's as a steel rod is broken by an iron bar.Before they separated Arthur promised that he would write and tellHetty there could be no further communication between them. And thispromise he kept. Adam rested content with the assurance that nothing butan innocent flirtation had been stopped. As the days went by he foundthat the calm patience with which he had waited for Hetty's love hadforsaken him since that night in the beech-grove. The agitations ofjealousy had given a new restlessness to his passion.Hetty for her part after the first misery caused by Arthur's letterhad turned into a mood of dull despair and sought only for change. Whyshould she not marry Adam She did not care what she did so that it madesome change in her life.So in November when Mr. Burge offered Adam a share in his businessAdam not only accepted it but decided that the time had come to askHetty to marry him.Hetty did not speak when Adam got out the question but his face wasvery close to hers and she put up her round cheek against his like akitten. She wanted to be caressed--she wanted to feel as if Arthur werewith her again.
comment609,Adam only said after that "I may tell your uncle and aunt mayn't IHetty" And she said "Yes."The red firelight on the hearth at the Hall Farm shone on joyful facesthat evening when Adam took the opportunity of telling Mr. and Mrs.Poyser that he saw his way to maintaining a wife now and that Hetty hadconsented to have him.There was a great deal of discussion before Adam went away about thepossibility of his finding a house that would do for him to settle in."Well well" said Mr. Poyser at last "we needna fix everythingto-night. You canna think o' getting married afore Easter. I'm not forlong courtships but there must be a bit o' time to make thingscomfortable."This was in November.Then in February came the full tragedy of Hetty Sorrel's life. She lefthome and in a strange village a child--Arthur Donnithorne's child--wasborn. Hetty left the baby in a wood and returned to find it dead.Arrest and trial followed and only at the last moment was the capitalsentence commuted to transportation.She died a few years later on her way home._IV.--The Wife of Adam Bede_It was the autumn of 1801 and Dinah Morris was once more at the HallFarm only to leave it again for her work in the town. Mrs. Poysernoticed that Dinah who never used to change colour flushed when Adamsaid "Why I hoped Dinah was settled among us for life. I thought she'dgiven up the notion o' going back to her old country.""Thought Yes" said Mrs. Poyser "and so would anybody else ha' thoughtas had got their right ends up'ards. But I suppose you must be aMethodist to know what a Methodist 'ull do. It's all guessing what thebats are flying after.""Why what have we done to you Dinah as you must go away from us"said Mr. Poyser. "It's like breaking your word for your aunt never hadno thought but you'd make this your home.""Nay uncle" said Dinah trying to be quite calm. "When I first came Isaid it was only for a time as long as I could be of any comfort to myaunt.""Well an' who said you'd ever left off being a comfort to me" saidMrs. Poyser. "If you didna mean to stay wi' me you'd better never ha'come. Them as ha' never had a cushion don't miss it."Dinah set off with Adam for Lisbeth was ailing and wanted Dinah to sitwith her a bit. On the way he reverted to her leaving the Hall Farm."You know best Dinah but if it had been ordered so that you could ha'been my sister and lived wi' us all our lives I should ha' counted itthe greatest blessing as could happen to us now."Dinah made no answer and they walked on in silence until presentlycrossing the stone stile Adam saw her face flushed and with a look ofsuppressed agitation.It struck him with surprise and then he said "I hope I've not hurt ordispleased you by what I've said Dinah perhaps I was making too free.I've no wish different from what you see to be best and I'm satisfiedfor you to live thirty miles off if you think it right."Poor Adam Thus do men blunder.Lisbeth opened his eyes on the Sunday morning when Adam sat at home andread from his large pictured Bible.For a long time his mother talked on about Dinah and about how theywere losing her when they might keep her and Adam at last told her shemust make up her mind that she would have to do without Dinah."Nay but I canna ma' up my mind when she's just cut out for thee an'nought shall ma' me believe as God didna make her and send her here o'purpose for thee. What's it sinnify about her being a Methody It 'udhappen wear out on her wi' marryin'."Adam threw himself back in his chair and looked at his mother. Heunderstood now what her talk had been aiming at and tried to chase awaythe notion from her mind.He was amazed at the way in which this new thought of Dinah's love hadtaken possession of him with an overmastering power that made all other
comment610,feelings give way before the impetuous desire to know that the thoughtwas true. He spoke to Seth who said quite simply that he had long givenup all thoughts of Dinah ever being his wife and would rejoice in hisbrother's joy. But he could not tell whether Dinah was for marrying."Thee might'st ask her" Seth said presently. "She took no offence at_me_ for asking and thee'st more right than I had."When Adam did ask Dinah answered that her heart was strongly drawntowards him but that she must wait for divine guidance. So she left theHall Farm and went back to the town and Adam waited--and then wentafter her to get his answer."Adam" she said when they had met and walked some distance together"it is the divine will. My soul is so knit to yours that it is but adivided life I live without you. And this moment now you are with meand I feel that our hearts are filled with the same love I have afullness of strength to bear and do our Heavenly Father's will that Ihad lost before."Adam paused and looked into her sincere eyes."Then we'll never part any more Dinah till death parts us."And they kissed each other with deep joy.                                   Felix Holt the Radical     "Felix Holt the Radical" was published in 1866. It has never     been one of George Eliot's very popular books. There is less     in it of her own life and experience than in most of her     novels less of the homely wit of agricultural England. The     real value of the book is the picture it gives of the social     and political life and for this reason it will always be     read by those who want to know what English political methods     and customs were like at the time of the passing of the Reform     Bill of 1832. The character of Mr. Rufus Lyon the independent     minister is an admirable study of the non-conformist of that     period. Esther's renunciation of a brilliant fortune for a     humbler lot with the man she loved and admired was quite in     accord with the teaching George Eliot inculcated all her life.     The scene of the story is laid in the Midlands and the     action covering about nine months begins in 1832._I.--The Minister's Daughter_The Rev. Rufus Lyon Minister of the Independent Chapel in theold-fashioned market town of Treby Magna in the County of Loumshirelived in a small house adjoining the entry which led to the ChapelYard.He sat this morning as usual in a low upstairs room called his studywhich served also as a sleeping-room and from time to time got up towalk about between the piles of old books which lay around him on thefloor. His face looked old and worn yet the curtain of hair that fellfrom his bald crown and hung about his neck retained much of itsoriginal auburn tint and his large brown short-sighted eyes were stillclear and bright. At the first glance everyone thought him a veryodd-looking rusty old man and the free-school boys often hooted afterhim and called him "Revelations." But he was too short-sighted and tooabsent from the world of small facts and petty impulses to notice thosewho tittered at him.He was meditating on the text for his Sunday morning sermon when oldLyddy the minister's servant opened the door to tell him that Mrs.Holt was wanting to see him. "She says she comes out of season but
comment611,she's in trouble."The minister bade her send Mistress Holt up and a tall elderly womandressed in black entered.Mrs. Holt Mr. Lyon said to himself is a woman who darkens counsel bywords without knowledge and angers the reason of the natural man andhe prayed for patience while his visitor rambled on concerning her latehusband and her son Felix.The minister made out that Felix objected to the sale of his father'squack medicines Holt's Elixir and Cancer Cure and wanted Mr. Lyon totalk to him."For after we'd been to chapel he spoke better of you than he does ofmost he said you was a fine old fellow and an old-fashioned Puritan--he uses dreadful language Mr. Lyon but I saw he didn't mean you illfor all that he calls most folks' religion rottenness."Mrs. Holt departed and in the evening when Mr. Lyon was in thesitting-room Felix Holt knocked at the door.The minister accustomed to the respectable air of provincial townsmenfelt a slight shock when his spectacles made clear to him the shaggy-headed large-eyed strong-limbed person of this questionable young manwithout waistcoat or cravat.Felix spoke loudly and brusquely when the minister mentioned the subjectof Mrs. Holt's visit."As to those absurd medicines and gulling advertisements that my motherhas been talking of to you I've no more doubt about _them_ than I haveabout pocket-picking. If I allowed the sale of those medicines to go onand my mother to live out of the proceeds when I can keep her by thehonest labour of hands I've not the least doubt that I should be arascal.""I would fain inquire more particularly into your objection to thesemedicines" said Mr. Lyon gravely."My father was ignorant" said Felix bluntly. "I know something aboutthese things. I was 'prentice for five miserable years to a stupid bruteof a country apothecary--my poor father left money for that--he thoughtnothing could be finer for me. No matter I know that the CatharticPills may be as bad as poison to half the people who swallow them andthat the cancer cure might as well be bottled ditch-water. I can keep mymother as well nay better than she keeps herself. With my watch andclock cleaning and teaching one or two little chaps that I've got tocome to me I can earn enough."Mr. Lyon's suggestion that some situation might be obtained as clerk orassistant was brushed aside."Why should I want to get into the middle class because I have somelearning The most of the middle class are as ignorant as the workingpeople about everything that doesn't belong to their own Brummagem
comment612,life."The entrance of Lyddy with the tea tray disturbed the conversation butthe minister interested in his visitor asked Felix to stay for a dishof tea and Felix accepted."My daughter who has been detained in giving a lesson in the Frenchtongue has doubtless returned now" said the minister. On the entranceof the young lady Felix was conscious she was not the sort of person hehad expected the minister's daughter to be and the incongruity repelledhim. There were things about her her walk the long neck and high crownof shining brown hair that suggested a fine lady to him. A fine ladywas always a sort of spun glass affair but a fine lady as the daughterof this rusty old Puritan was especially offensive.The discovery that Miss Lyon read Byron set Felix off on a tiradeagainst the poet and his works and throughout the meal no agreement onany topic seemed possible between Esther and the guest.Felix noted that Mr. Lyon was devoted to his daughter and stood in somefear of her."That is a singular young man Esther" said the minister when Felixhad gone. "I discern in him a love for whatever things are honest andtrue and I feel a great enlargement in his presence.""I think he is very coarse and rude" said Esther with a touch oftemper. "But he speaks better English than most of our visitors. What ishis occupation""Watch and clock making my dear."Esther was disappointed she thought he was something higher than that.Felix on his side wondered how the queer old minister had a daughter solittle in his own likeness. He decided that nothing should make himmarry._II.--The Election Riot_The return of Mr. Harold Transome to Transome Court after fifteenyears' absence and his adoption as Radical Candidate for the countycreated no little stir and excitement in Treby. It also assisted thegrowing intimacy between Mr. Lyon and Felix Holt for though neitherpossessed votes in that memorable year 1832 they shared the sameliberal sympathies. Perhaps the most delightful friendships are those inwhich there is much agreement much disputation and yet more personal
comment613,liking and the advent of the public-spirited contradictory yetaffectionate Felix into Treby life had made a welcome epoch to theminister.Esther had not seen so much of their new acquaintance as her father had.But she had begun to find him amusing though he always opposed andcriticised her and looked at her as if he never saw a single detailabout her person. It seemed to Esther that he thought slightly of her."But rude and queer as he is I cannot say there is anything vulgarabout him" she said to herself.One Sunday afternoon Felix Holt rapped at the door of Mr. Lyon's housealthough he could hear the voice of the minister in the chapel.Esther was in the kitchen alone reading a French romance and sheopened the door and invited him in.He scoffed at her book and as the talk went on upbraided her for hervanity. Finally he told her that he wanted her to change. "Of course Iam a brute to say so" he added. "I ought to say you are perfect.Another man would perhaps I can't bear to see you going the way of thefoolish women who spoil men's lives."Mortification and anger filled Esther's mind and when Felix got up tosay he was going she returned his "good-bye" without even looking athim.Only when the door closed she burst into tears. She revolted againsthis assumption of superiority.... Did he love her one little bit andwas that the reason why he wanted her to change But Esther was quitesure she could never love anyone who was so much of a pedagogue and amaster.Yet a few weeks later and Esther accepted willingly when Felixproposed a walk for the first time together. That same afternoon he toldher that she was very beautiful and that he would never be rich heintended going away to some manufacturing town to lead the people tobetter things and this meant a life of poverty.Something Esther said made Felix ask suddenly "Can you imagine yourselfchoosing hardship as the better lot""Yes I can" she answered flushing over neck and brow. They walkedhome very silently after that. Felix struggling as a firm man struggleswith a temptation Esther struggling as a woman struggles with theyearning for some expression of love.On the day of the election a mob of miners primed with liquor by anunscrupulous agent of Transome's came into the town to hoot the Toryvoters and as the disturbance increased Felix knowing that Mr. Lyonwas away preaching went round to the minister's house to reassureEsther."I am so thankful to see you" she said eagerly. He mentioned that themagistrates and constables were coming and that the town would bequieter. His only fear was that drinking might inflame the mob again.Again Felix told her of his renunciation of the ordinary hopes andambitions of men and at the same time tried to prove that he thoughtvery highly of her. He wanted her to know that her love was dear to himand he felt that they must not marry--to do so would be to ruin eachother's lives.When Felix went out into the streets in the afternoon the crowd waslarger and more mischievous. The constables were quite unable to copewith the mob the polling booth was closed for the day and themagistrates had sent to the neighbouring town of Duffield for themilitary.There were proofs that the predominant will of the crowd was in favourof Transome for several shops were attacked and they were all of them"Tory shops."Felix was soon hotly occupied trying to save a wretched publican namedSpratt from the fury of the crowd. The man had been dragged out into thestreets and Felix had got as near him as he could when a youngconstable armed with a sabre rushed upon him. It was a choice of twoevils and quick as lightning Felix frustrated him the constable fellundermost and Felix got his weapon. Tucker did not rise immediately butFelix did not imagine that he was much hurt and bidding the crowd
comment614,follow him tried to lead them away from the town. He hoped that thesoldiers would soon arrive and felt confident that there would be noresistance to a military force.Suddenly a cry was raised "Let us go to Treby Manor" the residence ofSir Maximus Debarry whose son was the Tory candidate.From that moment Felix was powerless and was carried along with therush. All he could hope to do was to get to the front terrace of thehouse and assure the inmates that the soldiers would arrive quickly.Just as he approached a large window he heard the horses of thetroopers and then came the words "Halt Fire" Before he had time tomove a bullet whizzed and passed through Felix Holt's shoulder--theshoulder of the arm that bore the sabre.Felix fell. The rioters ran confusedly like terrified sheep.It was a weary night for Felix and the next day his wound was declaredtrivial and he was lodged in Loumford Jail. There were three chargesagainst him that he had assaulted a constable that he had committedmanslaughter Tucker was dead from spinal concussion and that he hadled a riotous onslaught on a dwelling house.Four other men were arrested one for theft and three others for riotand assault._III.--The Trial_A great change took place in the fortunes of Esther in the intervalbetween the riot and the opening of the assizes. It was found that sheand not Harold Transome was the rightful owner of the Transome estates.For Esther's real name was Bycliffe and not Lyon and she was thestep-daughter only of the minister. Mr. Lyon had found Esther's mothera French woman of great beauty in destitution--her husband anEnglishman lying in some unknown prison. This Englishman was aBycliffe--and heir to the Transome property and on the proof of hisdeath Mr. Lyon knowing nothing of Bycliffe's family married his widowwho however died while Esther was still a tiny child. Not till thetime of the election did Esther learn that her real father was dead.Mr. Transome's lawyer--Jermyn--was fully aware of the claim of theBycliffes but knew they were powerless without money to enforce theclaim and that Esther and her step-father alike were ignorant of all
comment615,the facts. It was only when Harold Transome on his return quarrelledwith Jermyn on the management of the estates and after the Electionwhich Transome lost threatened him with a law-suit that Jermyn turnedround and told Harold the truth. At the same time another lawyerformerly in Jermyn's confidence thought the more profitable coursecould be found in throwing Jermyn over and wrote to Esther informingher of her inheritance.Harold Transome decided to act openly. With his mother he drove to theminister's house and Mrs. Transome persuaded Esther to come and stay atTransome Court. Both mother and son found Esther to their liking and itappeared to Harold that marriage with Esther would be a happy conclusionto the divided claim to the property. He was rich and the Transome orBycliffe property was heavily encumbered.The Transomes Esther and Mr. Lyon all agreed that no law-suit over theproperty should take place.But while Esther stayed at Transome Court she never forgot her friend inprison. Mr. Lyon had visited Felix and Esther herself obtained aninterview with him just before the assizes began.She had grown conscious that Harold Transome was making love to herthat Mrs. Transome really desired her for a daughter-in-law and itseemed to her as she waited with the minister in the cheerless prisonroom that she stood at the first and last parting of the ways.Soon the door opened and Felix Holt entered."Miss Lyon--Esther" and her hand was in his grasp. He was just thesame--no something inexpressibly better because of the distance andseparation which made him like the return of morning."Take no heed of me children" said Mr. Lyon. "I have some notes tomake." And the old man sat down at a window with his back to themwriting with his head bent close to the paper.Felix had heard of Esther's change of fortune and felt sure she wouldmarry Harold Transome. It was only when the time for parting came thathe could bring himself to say"I had a horrible struggle Esther. But you see I was right. There was afitting lot in reserve for you." Esther felt too miserable for tears tocome. She looked helplessly at Felix for a moment then took her handsfrom his and turning away mutely said "Father I am ready--there is
comment616,no more to say.""Esther."She heard Felix say the word with an entreating cry and went towardshim swiftly. He clasped her and they kissed each other.When the trial came on Esther went under Mrs. Transome's protection tothe court.The case against Felix looked very black when the prosecution closed.Various respectable witnesses swore to the prisoner's leadership of themob to his fatal assault on Tucker and to his attitude in front of thedrawing-room window at the Manor.Felix then gave a concise narrative of his motives and conduct on theday of the riot and explained that in throwing the constable down hehad not foreseen the possibility of death ensuing. It was a goodstraightforward speech not without a touch of defiant independencewhich did the prisoner little good with judge or jury.Mr. Lyon and Harold Transome both gave evidence in favour of Felixstating that the prisoner had often expressed his hatred of rioting andhad protested with indignation against the treating that went on duringthe election by some of the Radical agents.One or two witnesses were called who swore that Felix had tried to leadthe mob in the opposite direction to Treby Manor and it was understoodthat the case for the defence was closed.Then it came to Esther that she must speak if Felix was to be saved.There had been no witness to tell what had been his behaviour justbefore the riot. There was time but not too much time.Before Harold Transome was aware of Esther's intention she was on herway to the witness-box.A sort of gleam shot across the face of Felix Holt and anyone close tothe prisoner would have seen that his hand trembled for the first timeat Esther's beautiful aspect. There was no blush on her face she stooddivested of all personal consideration whether of vanity or shyness andgave her story as if she had been making a confession of faith.She knew Felix Holt well she said. He came to see her on the day of theelection and told her he feared the men might collect again afterdrinking. "It was the last thing he would have done to join in riot orto hurt any man if he could have helped it. He could never have had anyintention that was not brave and good."When she was back in her place Felix could not help looking towards her
comment617,and their eyes met in one solemn glance.Esther stayed in court till the end. She heard the verdict "Guilty ofManslaughter" followed by the judge's sentence "Imprisonment for fouryears." But so great was the impression made by Esther's speech that apetition to the Home Secretary was at once set on foot by the leadingmen of the county._IV.--Felix and Esther_One April day when the sun shone on the lingering raindrops Lyddy wasgone out and Esther chose to sit in the kitchen. She was not readingbut stitching and as her fingers moved nimbly something played abouther lips like a ray.A loud rap came at the door."Mr. Lyon at home" said Felix in his firm tones. "No sir" saidEsther "but Miss Lyon is if you'll please to walk in.""Esther" exclaimed Felix amazed.They held each other by both hands and looked into each other's faceswith delight."You are out of prison""Yes till I do something bad again. But you--how is it all Are youcome back to live here then""Yes.""You are not going to be married to Harold Transome or to be rich""No.""Why" said Felix in rather a low tone leaning his elbow on the tableand resting his head on his hand while he looked at her."I did not wish to marry him or to be rich.""You have given it all up" said Felix leaning forward a little andspeaking in a still lower tone. "Could you share the life of a poor manthen Esther""If I thought well enough of him" she said with a smile and a prettymovement of her head."Have you considered well what it would be--that it would be a verybare and simple life and the people I shall live among Esther Theyhave not just the same follies and vices as the rich but they havetheir own forms of folly and vice. It is very serious Esther.""I know it is serious" said Esther looking up at him. "Since I havebeen at Transome Court I have seen many things very seriously. If I hadnot I should not have left what I did leave. I made a deliberatechoice."She could not tell him that at Transome Court all that finally seemedbalanced against her love for him was the offer of a silken bondagethat arrested all motive and was nothing better than a well-cushioneddespair. A vision of being restless amidst ease of being languid amongall appliances had quickened her resignation of the Transome estates.Esther explained however that she thought of retaining a little of thewealth."How" said Felix anxiously. "What do you mean"
comment618,"I think even of two pounds a week one needn't live up to the splendourof all that you know we might live as simply as you liked. And then Ithink of a little income for your mother and a little income for myfather to save him from being dependent when he is no longer able topreach"Felix put his hand on her shoulder said lifting up his eyes with asmile"Why I shall be able to set up a great library and lend the books"They laughed merrily each holding the other's arms like girl and boy.There was the ineffable sense of youth in common.Then Felix leaned forward that their lips might meet and after thathis eyes roved tenderly over her face and curls."I'm a rough severe fellow Esther. Shall you never repent--never beinwardly reproaching me that I was not a man who could have shared yourwealth Are you quite sure"The very next May Felix and Esther were married. Everyone in those dayswas married at the parish church but Mr. Lyon was not satisfied withoutan additional private solemnity "so that he might have a more enlargedutterance of joy and supplication."It was a very simple wedding but no wedding even the gayest everraised so much interest and debate in Treby Magna. Even the very greatpeople of the county went to the church to look at this bride who hadrenounced wealth and chosen to be the wife of a man who said he wouldalways be poor.Some few shook their heads could not quite believe it and thoughtthere was more behind. But the majority of honest Trebians were affectedsomewhat in the same way as Mr. Wall the brewer of the town whoobserved to his wife as they walked home "I feel somehow as if Ibelieved more in everything that's good."Felix and Esther did not take up their abode in Treby Magna and afterawhile Mr. Lyon left the town too and joined them where they dwelt.As to the town in which Felix Holt now resides I will keep that asecret.I will only say that Esther has never repented. Felix however grumblesa little that she has made his life too easy.There is a young Felix who has a great deal more science than hisfather but not much more money.                                   Romola     "Romola" was George Eliot's fifth book and followed "Silas     Marner" which was published in 1861. It is a story of     Florence in the days of Savonarola and was largely the     outcome of a visit the novelist paid to Italy with her     life-long friend George Henry Lewes. With dim ideas for the     story in her mind she made exhaustive researches in the     Florentine libraries gathering historical and topographical     details of the city and its life as they were in the medival     period which she was setting herself to re-create. After much     study there and at home and after one false start she made a     serious beginning in January 1862. She was engaged upon it     for eighteen months always in doubt and sometimes in despair     of her ability to accomplish the task and by June of the     following year she had thankfully written the last words of     what is regarded by some as her greatest book. Meanwhile the     romance had begun to appear serially in the "Cornhill" in     July 1862. The writing of "Romola" is said to have "ploughed     into her" more than any of her other books._I.--Tito and Little Tessa_Under the Loggia de Cerchi in the heart of old Florence in the earlymorning of April 9 1492 two men had their eyes fixed on each other.One was looking downward with the scrutiny of curiosity the otherlying on the pavement was looking upward with the startled gaze of asuddenly awakened dreamer."Young man" said the standing figure pointing to a ring on the fingerof the other "when your chin has got a stiffer crop on it you'll knowbetter than to take your nap in street corners with a ring like that onyour forefinger. By the holy 'vangels if it had been anybody but mestanding over you--but Bratti Ferravecchi is not the man to steal Threeyears ago one San Giovanni the saint sent a dead body in my way--ablind beggar with his cap well lined with pieces. But how comes a young
comment619,man like you with the face of Messer San Michele to be sleeping on astone bed Your tunic and hose match ill with that jewel young man.Anybody might say the saints had sent you a dead body but if you tookthe jewels I hope you buried him--and you can afford a mass or two forhim into the bargain"Something like a painful thrill appeared to dart through the frame ofthe listener and arrest the careless stretching of his arms. But heimmediately recovered an air of indifference took off the red Levantinecap which hung like a great purse over his left ear and pushing backhis long dark brown curls said smiling "The fact is I'm a strangerin Florence and when I came in footsore last night I preferredflinging myself in the corner of this hospitable porch to hunting for achance hostelry which might turn out to be a nest of bloodsuckers. Canyou show me the way to a more lively quarter where I can get a meal anda lodging""That I can" said Bratti.And talking volubly as they went Bratti led the way to the MercatoVecchio or the Old Market promising to conduct him to the prettiestdamsel in the Mercato for a cup of milk.But as soon as they emerged from the narrow streets into the Old Marketthey found the place packed with excited groups of men and women hummingwith gossip."Diavolo" said Bratti. "The Mercato has gone as mad as if the HolyFather had excommunicated us again I must know what this is."He pushed about among the crowd inquiring and disputing and waspresently absorbed in discussing the newest development of Florentinepolitics the death of Lorenzo de Medici and whether or not this deathwas the beginning of the time of tribulation that Savonarola had beenseeing in visions and foretelling in sermons.Indifferent to this general agitation the young stranger became tiredof waiting for Bratti's escort and strolling on round the piazza felton a sudden thought in the wallet that hung at his waist."Not an obolus by Jupiter" he murmured in a language that was notTuscan or even Italian. "I must get my breakfast for love then"In a corner away from any group of talkers two mules were standing.One carried wooden milk vessels the other a pair of panniers filledwith herbs and salads. Resting her elbow on the mule that carried themilk there leaned a young girl apparently not more than sixteen witha red hood surrounding her face which was all the more baby-like in its
comment620,prettiness from the entire concealment of her hair. The poor child wasweary and it seemed to have gone to sleep in that half-standinghalf-leaning posture. Nevertheless our stranger had no compunction inawaking her. She opened her baby-blue eyes and stared up withastonishment and confusion."Forgive me pretty one for awaking you" he said. "I'm dying withhunger and the scent of milk makes breakfast seem more desirable thanever."She bestirred herself and in a few moments a large cup of fragrant milkwas held out to him and by the time he set the cup down she had broughtbread from a bag which hung by the side of the mule and shyly andmutely insisted on his taking it even though he told her he had nothingto pay her with and just as he was leaning down to kiss her he washarshly interrupted by Monna Ghita Tessa's mother who had come uponthem unobserved.The handsome presence of the stranger and his charm of manner were of noavail with Monna Ghita her noisy rating of him drew Bratti and thebarber Nello to the spot and with these he was glad to make good hisescape having waived a furtive adieu to the pretty Tessa.It was not until after Bratti having business at home had handed theyoung stranger over to Nello and in the barber's shop he had beenshaved and trimmed and made to look presentable that Tito Melemabecame more confidential and explained that he was a Greek that he wasreturning from adventures abroad had suffered shipwreck and foundhimself in Florence with nothing saved from the disaster but some fewrare old gems for which he was anxious to obtain a purchaser."Let us see let us see" said Nello walking up and down his shop."What you want is a man of wealth and influence and scholarly tastesand that man is Bartolommeo Scala the Secretary of our Republic. Hecame to Florence as a poor adventurer himself a miller's son and thatmay be a reason why he may be the more ready to do a good turn to astrange scholar. I could take you to a man who if he has a mind canhelp you to a chance of a favourable interview with Scala--a man worthseeing for his own sake too to say nothing of his collections or ofhis daughter Romola who is as fair as the Florentine lily before it gotquarrelsome and turned red.""But if the father of this beautiful Romola makes collections whyshould he not like to buy some of my gems himself"Nello shrugged his shoulders. "For two good reasons--want of sight tolook at the gems and want of money to pay for them."_II.--"More than a Man's Ransom"_He was a moneyless blind old scholar the Bardo de Bardi to whom Nellointroduced Tito Melema a man who came of a proud energetic stockwhose ancestors had loved to play the signor had been merchants andusurers of keen daring and conspicuous among those who clutched thesword in the earliest world-famous quarrels of Florentine withFlorentine. The family passions lived on in Bardo under alteredconditions he was a man with a deep-veined hand cramped by much copyingof manuscripts who ate sparing dinners and wore threadbare clothes atfirst from choice and at last from necessity who sat among his booksand manuscripts and saw them only by the light of those far-off youngerdays which still shone in his memory.And among his books and antiquities and rare marble fragments in aspacious room surrounded with laden shelves Romola was his dailycompanion and assistant. There was a time when he had hoped that hisson Dino would have followed in his steps to be the prop of his age
comment621,and to take up and continue his scholarly labours after he was dead. ButDino had failed him Dino had given himself up to religion and enteredthe priesthood and the passion of Bardo's resentment had flamed intofierce hatred towards this recreant son of his and none dared so muchas to name him within his hearing.Maso the old serving-man ushered in the two visitors he had announced afew minutes previously and Nello introduced Tito to Bardo and hisdaughter as a scholar of considerable learning.Romola's astonishment could hardly have been greater if the stranger hadworn a panther-skin and carried a thyrsus for the cunning barber hadsaid nothing of the Greeks age or appearance and among her father'sscholarly visitors she had hardly ever seen any but gray-headed men.Nevertheless she returned Tito's bow with the same pale proud face asever but as he approached the snow melted and when he ventured to looktowards her again a pink flush overspread her face to vanish againalmost immediately as if her imperious will had recalled it. Tito'sglance on the other hand as he looked at this tall maiden of seventeenor eighteen as she stood at the reading-desk with one hand on the backof her father's chair had that gentle beseeching admiration in itwhich is the most propitiating of appeals to a proud shy woman and isperhaps the only atonement a man can make for being too handsome."Messere I give you welcome" said Bardo with some condescension"misfortune wedded to learning and especially to Greek learning is aletter of credit that should win the ear of every instructedFlorentine."He proceeded to question Tito as to what part of Greece he came fromlearned that he was a young man of unusual scholastic attainments andthat he had a father who was himself a scholar."At least" said Tito "a father by adoption. He was a Neapolitan but"he added after another slight pause "he is lost to me--was lost on avoyage he too rashly undertook to Delos."Bardo forbore to speak further on so painful a topic he discoursedfreely upon his own studies his past hopes and the one great ambitionthat remained to him--that his library and his magnificent collection oftreasures should not be dissipated on his death but should become theproperty of the public and be honourably housed in Florence for alltime with his name over the door.In his eagerness he made passing reference to his son of how Romola hadbeen filling his place to the best of her power and plainly hinted--andTito was not slow to profit by the opportunity--that if he could havethe young Greek scholar to work with him instead of her he might yetlook to fulfill some of the notable designs he had abandoned when hisblindness came upon him."But" he resumed in his original tone of condescension "we aredeparting from what I believe is your most important business. Nelloinformed me that you had certain gems which you would fain dispose of.""I have one or two intagli of much beauty" said Tito. "But they are nowin the keeping of Messer Domenico Cennini who has a strong and safeplace for such things. He estimates them as worth at least five hundredducats.""Ah then they are fine intagli" said Bardo. "Five hundred ducats Ahmore than a man's ransom"Tito gave a slight almost imperceptible start and opened his longdark eyes with questioning surprise at Bardo's blind face as if hiswords--a mere phrase of common parlance at a time when men were oftenbeing ransomed from slavery or imprisonment--had some special meaningfor him.But Bardo had used the words in all innocence and went on to talk ofsuperstitions that attached to certain gems and to undertake that hewould use his influence with the Secretary of the Republic in Tito'sbehalf. Both Romola and her father were attracted by the charm andfreshness and apparent simplicity of the young man but just as he wasmaking ready to depart they were interrupted by the entrance of Bernardodel Nero one of the chief citizens of Florence Bardo's oldest friend
comment622,and Romola's godfather and Bernardo felt an instant instinctivedistrust of the handsome ingratiating stranger and did not hesitate tosay so after Tito had left them."Remember Bardo" he said at length "thou hast a rare gem of thy owntake care no one gets it who is not like to pay a worthy price. Thatpretty Greek has a sleekness about him that seems marvelously fitted forslipping into any nest he fixes his mind on."_III.--The Man who was Wronged_It was undeniable that Tito's coming had been the dawn of a new life forboth father and daughter and he grew to care for Romola supremely--towish to have her for his beautiful and loving wife.He took her place as Bardo's assistant and served him with an easyefficiency that had been beyond her and she happier in her father'shappiness had given her love to Tito even before he ventured to offerher his own. He was thus sailing under the fairest breeze and besidesconvincing fair judges that his talents squared with his good fortunehe wore that fortune so unpretentiously that no one seemed to beoffended by it.And that was not the whole of Tito's good fortune for he had sold hisjewels and was master of full five hundred gold florins. Yet the momentwhen he first had this sum in his possession was the crisis of the firstserious struggle his facile good-humoured nature had known."A man's ransom" Who was it that had said five hundred florins was morethan a man's ransom If now under this mid-day sun on some hot coastfar away a man somewhat stricken in years--a man not without highthoughts and with the most passionate heart--a man who long years agohad rescued a little boy from a life of beggary filth and cruel wrongand had reared him tenderly if that man were now under this summersun toiling as a slave hewing wood and drawing water If he weresaying to himself "Tito will find me. He had but to carry our gems toVenice he will have raised money and will never rest till he finds meout" If that were certain could he--Tito--see the price of the gemslying before him and say "I will stay at Florence where I am fannedby soft airs of love and prosperity I will not risk myself for hissake" No surely not _if it were certain_. But the galley had beentaken by a Turkish vessel that was known by the report of the companiongalley which had escaped and there had been resistance and probablebloodshed a man had been seen falling overboard.He quieted his conscience with such reasonings as these and whendefinite tidings reached him that his father was still a prisoner hecontrived to keep the knowledge to himself and still did nothing. Thedeath of the exhausted emaciated monk who had brought these tidingsfreed him of one fear but this monk was Romola's brother Dino andobeying his summons she had been in secret to see him as he lay dying."Romola" her brother began to speak "in the deep night as I layawake I saw my father's room and I saw you ... And at the _leggio_where I used to stand stood a man whose face I could not see. I saw himmove and take thee Romola by the hand and then I saw thee take myfather by the hand and you all three went down the stone steps into thestreets the man whose face was a blank to me leading the way. And youstood at the altar of Santa Croce and the priest who married you hadthe face of death and the graves opened and the dead in their shroudsfollowed you like a bridal train. And it seemed to me that at last youcame to a stony place where there was no water and no trees or herbagebut instead of water I saw written parchment unrolling itselfeverywhere and instead of trees and herbage I saw men of bronze andmarble springing up and crowding round you. And my father was faint andfell to the ground and the man loosed thy hand and departed and as hewent I could see his face and it was the face of the Great Tempter....Thrice have I had that vision Romola. I believe it is a revelationmeant for thee--to warn thee against marriage as a temptation of the
comment623,enemy...."The words died away."Frate" said the dying voice. "Give her----""The crucifix" said the voice of Fra Girolamo Savonarola who wasstanding in the shadows behind her."Dino" said Romola with a low but piercing cry."Take the crucifix my daughter" said Fra Girolamo after a fewminutes. "His eyes behold it no more."                                   But heedless of the distrust and opposition of Messer Bernardo delNero and with this vision of Dino's menacing his highest hope Titowent gaily on his triumphant way.Also he had renewed acquaintance with the little Tessa. He came upon herin the thronged streets during carnival time and seeing her atimorous tearful little _contadin_ terrified by the burlesque threatsof a boisterous conjurer took her under his protection.Thereafter he met her again at intervals finding her naive love andhumble adoration and obedience very pleasant and meeting her once at apeasant's fair he jestingly yielded to the burlesque solicitations of amountebank in a white mitre paid a small fee and went through anabsurd ceremony of mock-marriage with her.Tessa herself believed the marriage to be real enough and he would notmar her delight by undeceiving her. Later since she was wretched athome with her scolding mother and a brutal step-father and there weredangers in allowing her to go on waylaying him in streets when too longa period elapsed between his visits to her he quietly took her away andestablished her in a small house on the outskirts of the city with thedeaf discreet old Monna Lisa as her servant and companion.Neither this nor the darker secret of his treachery to his adoptivefather cast any cloud over his habitual cheerfulness. His love forRomola was a higher and deeper passion than anything he felt for thechild-like submissive little Tessa and when she told him frankly ofher brother's warning vision he set himself to convince her it was themere nightmare of a diseased imagination and the perfect love and trustshe had for him made the task easy.For a while after their marriage she was ideally happy she was not evenseparated from her father for Tito came to live with them and was toBardo in his scholastic labours all that he had wished his own son tobe. Then came the first cloud.On November 17 1494 more than eighteen months after the marriage ofTito and Romola the King of France marched his army into Florence onhis way to take possession of Naples and impose peace on the warringlittle states into which Italy was divided. There were those in Florencewho were prepared to welcome the invaders but the majority the commonpeople in particular resented their coming.With the soldiery came three wretched prisoners they were led in ropesby their captors and with blows from knotted cords were stimulated tobeg. Two as they passed held out their hands crying piteously "Forthe love of God and the Holy Madonna give us something towards ourransom"But the third remained obstinately silent. He was old white-hairedemaciated with a thick-set figure that seemed to express energy inspite of age yet there was something fitful in his eyes.This sight was witnessed by the Florentines with growing exasperationand presently from jeering at the French soldiers and hustling themthey became bent upon rescuing this third prisoner from his tormentorsone venturesome youth suddenly dashed in cut the old man's bonds andurged him to run and the next moment he had plunged into the crowdwhich closed behind him and hampered the pursuit.With one soldier struggling desperately on his track the fugitive spedtowards the Duomo to seek refuge in that sanctuary but in mounting the
comment624,steps his foot slipped he was precipitated towards a group of signoriwho stood there with their backs to him and clutched one to savehimself.It was Tito Melema who felt the clutch. He turned and saw the face ofhis adoptive father Baldassarre Calvo close to his own. The two menlooked at each other silent as death Tito with cheeks and lips allbloodless fascinated by terror. The next instant the grasp on his armrelaxed and Baldassarre disappeared within the church._IV.--Romola's Ordeal_With Baldassarre lurking in Florence Tito went in hourly fear. At anymoment the story of his baseness might be blown abroad at any momentworse still he might be struck down by the old man in whose wild eyeshe had read only a fierce yearning for vengeance.As a precaution Tito took to wearing a coat of fine chain-mail underhis doublet and the discovery of this alarmed Romola for his safetyand shocked her with a suspicion that he was something of a coward.But by now Tito was deeply involved in Florentine politics and easilypersuaded her that it was against secret political intriguers that hethus shielded himself. He went on to confess that his life was no longersafe in Florence and he was resolved to leave the city for good. But tothis she demurred her father had died and left his library and hiscollection as a sacred trust to her and Tito and until they had carriedout his wish and made them over to the city authorities she felt shecould not go.Tito made light of her scruples. Her father's wish he said had been amere foolish vanity they had need of money and he intended to sellboth the library and collection and when for the first time in herlife she spoke bitterly in scorn and anger of his faithlessness hetold her flatly it was useless to bandy words for he had sold themalready and they were to be removed that day.Frantic with grief and resentment she thought of desperate ways ofpreventing the accomplishment of his heartless plans even to borrowingof her godfather and buying back the treasures so that Tito might keephis ill-gotten gain and her father's last wish still be fulfilled buthe convinced her that all interference was too late for the things hadbeen purchased by the Count di San Severino and the Seneschal deBeaucaire who were already on their way with the French king to Sienna.
comment625,Latterly in many ways Romola had been disappointed in her husband'scharacter she had found that his handsome face and gay air masked acowardice a cunning meanness a sordid selfishness of disposition thatwere all at variance with her high ideal of him but that finalunspeakable treachery of the dead man who had trusted him so implicitlyshattered her love for Tito utterly.As soon as her father's library was dismantled and his treasures takenaway Romola went from the house with the old man-servant Maso andwould never have looked upon Tito's face again but that Fra Girolamointercepted her."I have a command to call you back" he said. "My daughter you mustreturn to your place. You are flying from your debts the debt of aFlorentine woman to her fellow citizens the debt of a wife. You areturning your back on the lot that has been appointed for you--you aregoing to choose another. My daughter you are fleeing from the presenceof God into the wilderness. My daughter if the cross comes to you as awife you must carry it as a wife. You may say 'I will forsake myhusband' but you cannot cease to be a wife."There was hunger and misery in the streets and he urged upon her thatif she had no other purpose in life she could stay and help the poor ofher own city. Her pride was broken and she yielded._V.--Baldassarre is Avenged_Meanwhile Baldassarre lurking about Florence had armed himself with aknife and was ravenous for revenge. Being homeless he called by chanceat Tessa's little house and she not knowing who he was took pity onhis age and misery gave him shelter in a shed and food and drink.Whilst he was there Tito came and too frankly simple to keep anythingfrom him Tessa confessed that she had disobeyed his injunctions againstholding converse with strangers and was sheltering a strange weary oldman in the shed without. Her description of this guest left Tito in nodoubt as to his identity and subduing his first perturbation heconceived that he might turn the situation to his own advantage. He wentout to the shed and looking down upon Baldassarre in the moonlightsought to propitiate him with honeyed words specious explanations anda plea for pardon. But the old man answered nothing till hissmouldering fury burst into a flame then he precipitated himself upon
comment626,the intruder and struck with all his force but the blade of the knifebroke off short against the hidden coat of mail.Tito insisted that he was welcome to remain there and said what hecould to soothe him but Baldassarre would stay no longer when he knewwhose roof covered him. Presently he armed himself anew and waited foranother opportunity. He learned all that was to be known of Tito'scareer since his arrival in Florence ascertained that he was marriedand had thoughts of winning his wife's sympathy and telling her ofTessa. Then one night he contrived to get into the Rucellai Gardenswhere Tito was at supper with a gathering of Florentine notabilitiesand seized in time and held back from assassinating him hepassionately denounced him before the company as a scoundrel a liarand a robber.There were those present who had been on the church steps that day whenBaldassarre had clutched Tito by the arm and Tito had then explainedaway his momentary panic. Questioned now by one of these he declaredthat though when first he encountered his accuser he did not recognisehim he now saw that he was the servant who years ago accompanied himand his adoptive father to Greece and was dismissed on account ofmisdemeanours and that the story of his being rescued from beggary wasthe vision of a disordered brain.Baldassarre was given a chance to prove that he was not the servant butthe great scholar to whom Tito was indebted for his learning."The ring I possess" said Rucellai "is a fine sard that I myselfpurchased from Messer Tito. It is engraved with a subject from Homer.Will you turn to the passage in Homer from which that subject wastaken"But sitting to look over the book Baldassarre realised that thesufferings through which he had passed had unhinged his mind and hismemory the words he stared at had no meaning for him and he lifted hishands to his head in despair.The consequence of this fresh failure was that Baldassarre was cast intoprison and Tito was at liberty to pursue his political ambitionsunhaunted by that dogging shadow that was to him as the shadow of death.He managed his affairs so cleverly that whichever party came uppermosthe was secure of favour and money.But by-and-by the tide began to turn against him. Baldassarre was atlarge again and met Romola and told her not only of his own wrongs butof Tessa. She saw Tessa and her two children and befriended them andwas so far from blaming that innocent little creature that she did noteven disclose the truth to her but she was importunate with Tito thathe should make atonement to the man who had been a father to him. Thencame a day when Tito's treacheries were discovered by the party he wassupposed to serve and he had to flee for his life through Florence.Scattering jewels and gold to delay his pursuers he leaped from thebridge into the river and swam in the darkness leaving the bellowingmob to think he was drowned.But far down the stream there were certain eyes that saw him from thebanks of the river and when he landed and fell faint and helplessBaldassarre's hands closed on his throat and next evening a passer-by
comment627,found the two dead bodies there.                                   Silas Marner     "Silas Marner the Weaver of Raveloe" begun about November     1860 and published early in 1861 is in many respects the     most admirable of all George Eliot's works. It is not a long     story but it is a most carefully finished novel--"a perfect     gem a pure work of art" Mr. Oscar Browning describes it. Mr.     Blackwood the publisher found it rather sombre and George     Eliot replied to him "I hope you will not find it at all a     sad story as a whole since it sets--or is intended to set--in     a strong light the remedial influences of pure natural human     relations. I have felt all through as if the story would have     lent itself best to metrical rather than to prose fiction     especially in all that relates to the psychology of Silas     except that under that treatment there could not be an equal     play of humour." No novel of George Eliot's has received more     praise from men of letters than "Silas Marner."_I.--Why Silas Came to Raveloe_In the early years of the nineteenth century a linen-weaver named SilasMarner worked at his vocation in a stone cottage that stood among thenutty hedgerows near the village of Raveloe and not far from the edgeof a deserted stone-pit.It was fifteen years since Silas Marner had first come to Raveloe hewas then simply a pallid young man with prominent short-sighted browneyes. To the villagers among whom he had come to settle he seemed tohave mysterious peculiarities chiefly owing to his advent from anunknown region called "North'ard." He invited no comer to step acrosshis door-sill and he never strolled into the village to drink a pint atthe Rainbow or to gossip at the wheel-wrights' he sought no man orwoman save for the purposes of his calling or in order to supplyhimself with necessaries.At the end of fifteen years the Raveloe men said just the same thingsabout Silas Marner as at the beginning. There was only one importantaddition which the years had brought it was that Master Marner had laidby a fine sight of money somewhere and that he could buy up "bigger menthan himself."But while his daily habits presented scarcely any visible changeMarner's inward life had been a history and a metamorphosis as that ofevery fervid nature must be when it has been condemned to solitude. Hislife before he came to Raveloe had been filled with the closefellowship of a narrow religious sect where the poorest layman had the
comment628,chance of distinguishing himself by gifts of speech and Marner washighly thought of in that little hidden world known to itself as thechurch assembling in Lantern Yard. He was believed to be a young man ofexemplary life and ardent faith and a peculiar interest had beencentred in him ever since he had fallen at a prayer-meeting into atrance or cataleptic fit which lasted for an hour.Among the members of his church there was one young man named WilliamDane with whom he lived in close friendship and it seemed to theunsuspecting Silas that the friendship suffered no chill even after hehad formed a closer attachment and had become engaged to a youngservant-woman.At this time the senior deacon was taken dangerously ill and Silas andWilliam with others of the brethren took turns at night-watching. Onthe night the old man died Silas fell into one of his trances and whenhe awoke at four o'clock in the morning death had come and further alittle bag of money had been stolen from the deacon's bureau andSilas's pocket-knife was found inside the bureau. For some time Silaswas mute with astonishment then he said "God will clear me I knownothing about the knife being there or the money being gone. Search meand my dwelling."The search was made and it ended in William Dane finding the deacon'sbag empty tucked behind the chest of drawers in Silas's chamber.According to the principles of the church in Lantern Yard prosecutionwas forbidden to Christians. But the members were bound to take othermeasures for finding out the truth and they resolved on praying anddrawing lots there was nothing unusual about such proceedings a hundredyears ago. Silas knelt with his brethren relying on his own innocencebeing certified by immediate Divine interference. _The lots declaredthat Silas Marner was guilty_. He was solemnly suspended from church-membership and called upon to render up the stolen money only onconfession and repentance could he be received once more within the foldof the church. Marner listened in silence. At last when everyone roseto depart he went towards William Dane and said in a voice shaken byagitation "The last time I remember using my knife was when I took itout to cut a strap for you. I don't remember putting it in my pocketagain. _You_ stole the money and you have woven a plot to lay the sinat my door. But you may prosper for all that there is no just God buta God of lies that bears witness against the innocent"There was a general shudder at this blasphemy. Poor Marner went out withthat despair in his soul--that shaken trust in God and man which islittle short of madness to a loving nature. In the bitterness of hiswounded spirit he said to himself "_She_ will cast me off too" andfor a whole day he sat alone stunned by despair.The second day he took refuge from benumbing unbelief by getting intohis loom and working away as usual and before many hours were pastthe minister and one of the deacons came to him with a message fromSarah the young woman to whom he had been engaged that she held herengagement at an end. In little more than a month from that time Sarah
comment629,was married to William Dane and not long afterwards it was known to thebrethren in Lantern Yard that Silas Marner had departed from the town._II.--The Second Blow_When Silas Marner first came to Raveloe he seemed to weave like aspider from pure impulse without reflection. Then there were the callsof hunger and Silas in his solitude had to provide his own breakfastdinner and supper to fetch his own water from the well and put hisown kettle on the fire and all these immediate promptings helped toreduce his life to the unquestioning activity of a spinning insect. Hehated the thought of the past there was nothing that called out hislove and fellowship towards the strangers he had come amongst and thefuture was all dark for there was no Unseen Love that cared for him.It was then when all purpose of life was gone that Silas got into thehabit of looking towards the money he received for his weaving andgrasping it with a sense of fulfilled effort. Gradually the guineasthe crowns and the half-crowns grew to a heap and Marner drew lessand less for his own wants trying to solve the problem of keepinghimself strong enough to work sixteen hours a day on as small an outlayas possible. He handled his coins he counted them till their form andcolour were like the satisfaction of a thirst to him but it was only inthe night when his work was done that he drew them out to enjoy theircompanionship. He had taken up some bricks in his floor underneath hisloom and here he had made a hole in which he set the iron pot thatcontained his guineas and silver coins covering the bricks with sandwhenever he replaced them.So year after year Silas Marner lived in this solitude his guineasrising in the iron pot and his life narrowing and hardening itself moreand more as it became reduced to the functions of weaving and hoarding.This is the history of Silas Marner until the fifteenth year after hecame to Raveloe. Then about the Christmas of that year a second greatchange came over his life.It was a raw foggy night with rain and Silas was returning from thevillage plodding along with a sack thrown round his shoulders andwith a horn lantern in his hand. His legs were weary but his mind wasat ease with the sense of security that springs from habit. Supper washis favourite meal because it was his time of revelry when his heartwarmed over his gold.He reached his door in much satisfaction that his errand was done heopened it and to his short-sighted eyes everything remained as he hadleft it except that the fire sent out a welcome increase of heat.As soon as he was warm he began to think it would be a long while towait till after supper before he drew out his guineas and it would bepleasant to see them on the table before him as he ate his food.He rose and placed his candle unsuspectingly on the floor near his loomswept away the sand without noticing any change and removed thebricks. The sight of the empty hole made his heart leap violently butthe belief that his gold was gone could not come at once--only terrorand the eager effort to put an end to the terror. He passed histrembling hand all about the hole then he held the candle and examinedit curiously trembling more and more. He searched in every corner he
comment630,turned his bed over and shook it and kneaded it he looked in hisbrick oven and when there was no other place to be searched he feltonce more all round the hole.He could see every object in his cottage and his gold was not there. Heput his trembling hands to his head and gave a wild ringing scream--the cry of desolation. Then the idea of a thief began to present itselfand he entertained it eagerly because a thief might be caught and madeto restore the gold. The robber must be laid hold of. Marner's ideas oflegal authority were confused but he felt that he must go and proclaimhis loss and the great people in the village--the clergyman theconstable and Squire Cass--would make the thief deliver up the stolenmoney.It was to the village inn Silas Marner went where the parish clerk anda select company were assembled and told the story of his loss--27212s. 6d. in all. The machinery of the law was set in motion but nothief was ever captured nor could grounds be found for suspicionagainst any persons.What had really happened was that Dunsey Cass Squire Cass's secondson--a mean boastful rascal--on his way home on foot from hunting sawthe light in the weaver's cottage and knocked hoping to borrow alantern for the lane was unpleasantly slippery and the night dark. Butall was silence in the cottage for the weaver at that moment had notyet reached home. For a minute Dunsey thought that old Marner might bedead fallen over into the stone pits. And from that came the decisionthat he must be dead. If so the question arose what would become ofthe money that everybody said the old miser had put byDunstan Cass was in difficulties for want of money and he had killedhis brother's horse that day on the hunting-field. Who would know ifMarner was dead that anybody had come to take his hoard of money awayThere were only three hiding-places where he had heard of cottagers'hoards being found the thatch the bed and a hole in the floor. Hiseyes travelling eagerly over the floor noted a spot where the sand hadbeen more carefully spread.Dunstan found the hole and the money now hidden in two leathern bags.From their weight he judged they must be filled with guineas. Quickly hehastened out into the darkness with the bags and Dunstan Cass was seenno more alive.At the very moment when he turned his back on the cottage Silas Marnerwas not more than a hundred yards away._III.--Silas Marner's Visitor_It was New Year's Eve and Squire Cass was giving a dance to theneighbouring gentry of Raveloe. There had been snow in the afternoonbut at seven o'clock it had ceased and a freezing wind had sprung up.A woman shabbily dressed with a child in her arms was making her waytowards Raveloe seeking the Red House where Squire Cass lived. It wasnot the squire she wanted but his eldest son Godfrey to whom she wassecretly married. The marriage--the result of rash impulse--had been anunhappy one from the first for Godfrey's wife was the slave of opium.The squire had long desired that his son should marry Miss NancyLammeter and would have turned him out of house and home had he knownof the unfortunate marriage already contracted. Cold and weariness drovethe woman even while she walked to the only comfort she knew. Sheraised the black remnant to her lips and then flung the empty phialaway. Now she walked always more and more drowsily and clutched more
comment631,and more automatically the sleeping child at her bosom. Soon she feltnothing but a supreme longing to lie down and sleep and so sank downagainst a straggling furze-bush an easy pillow enough and the bed ofsnow too was soft. The cold was no longer felt but her arms did notat once relax their instinctive clutch and the little one slumbered on.The complete torpor came at last the fingers lost their tension thearms unbent then the little head fell away from the bosom and the blueeyes of the child opened wide on the cold starlight. At first there wasa little peevish cry of "Mammy" as the child rolled downward and thensuddenly its eyes were caught by a bright gleaming light on the whiteground and with the ready transition of infancy it decided the lightmust be caught.In an instant the child had slipped on all fours and after making outthat the cunning gleam came from a very bright place the little onerising on its legs toddled through the snow--toddled on to the opendoor of Silas Marner's cottage and right up to the warm hearth wherewas a bright fire.The little one accustomed to be left to itself for long hours withoutnotice squatted down on the old sack spread out before the fire inperfect contentment. Presently the little golden head sank down and theblue eyes were veiled by their delicate half-transparent lids.But where was Silas Marner while this strange visitor had come to hishearth He was in the cottage but he did not see the child. Since hehad lost his money he had contracted the habit of opening his door andlooking out from time to time as if he thought that his money mightsomehow be coming back to him.That morning he had been told by some of his neighbours that it was NewYear's Eve and that he must sit up and hear the old year rung out andthe new rung in because that was good luck and might bring his moneyback again. Perhaps this friendly Raveloe way of jesting had helped tothrow Silas into a more than usually excited state. Certainly he openedhis door again and again that night and the last time just as he putout his hand to close it the invisible wand of catalepsy arrested himand there he stood like a graven image powerless to resist either thegood or evil that might enter.
comment632,When Marner's sensibility returned he was unaware of the break in hisconsciousness and only noticed that he was chilled and faint.Turning towards the hearth it seemed to his blurred vision as if therewas a heap of gold on the floor but instead of hard coin his fingersencountered soft warm curls. In utter amazement Silas fell on hisknees to examine the marvel it was a sleeping child a round fairthing with soft yellow rings all over its head. Could this be thelittle sister come back to him in a dream--his little sister whom he hadcarried about in his arms for a year before she died That was the firstthought. _Was_ it a dream It was very much like his little sister. Howand when had the child come in without his knowledgeBut there was a cry on the hearth the child had awakened and Marnerstooped to lift it on to his knee. He had plenty to do through the nexthour. The porridge sweetened with some dry brown sugar stopped thecries of the little one for "mammy." Then it occurred to Silas's dullbachelor mind that the child wanted its wet boots off and this havingbeen done the wet boots suggested that the child had been walking onthe snow.He made out the marks of the little feet in the snow and holding thechild in his arms followed their track to the furze-bush. Then hebecame aware that there was something more than the bush beforehim--that there was a human body half covered with the shifting snow.With the child in his arms Silas at once went for the doctor who wasspending the evening at the Red House. And Godfrey Cass recognised thatit was his own child he saw in Marner's arms.The woman was dead--had been dead for some hours the doctor said andGodfrey who had accompanied him to Marner's cottage understood that hewas free to marry Nancy Lammeter."You'll take the child to the parish to-morrow" Godfrey asked speakingas indifferently as he could."Who says so" said Marner sharply. "Will they make me take her I shallkeep her till anybody shows they've a right to take her away from me.The mother's dead and I reckon it's got no father. It's a lone thingand I'm a lone thing. My money's gone--I don't know where and this is
comment633,come from I don't know where."Godfrey returned to the Red House with a sense of relief and gladnessand Silas kept the child. There had been a softening of feeling to himin the village since the day of his robbery and now an active sympathywas aroused amongst the women. The child was christened Hephzibah afterMarner's mother and was called Eppie for short._IV--Eppie's Decision_Eppie had come to link Silas Marner once more with the whole world. Thedisposition to hoard had utterly gone and there was no longer anyrepulsion around to him.As the child grew up one person watched with keener though morehidden interest than any other the prosperous growth of Eppie under theweaver's care. The squire was dead and Godfrey Cass was married toNancy Lammeter. He had no child of his own save the one that knew himnot. No Dunsey had ever turned up and people had ceased to think ofhim.Sixteen years had passed and now Aaron Winthrop a well-behaved younggardener is wanting to marry Eppie and Eppie is willing to have him"some time.""'Everybody's married some time' Aaron says" said Eppie. "But I toldhim that wasn't true for I said look at father--he's never beenmarried.""No child" said Silas "your father was a lone man till you was sentto him.""But you'll never be lone again father" said Eppie tenderly. "That waswhat Aaron said--'I could never think o' taking you away from MasterMarner Eppie.' And I said 'It 'ud be no use if you did Aaron.' And hewants us all to live together so as you needn't work a bit fatheronly what's for your own pleasure and he'd be as good as a son toyou--that was what he said."The proposal to separate Eppie from her foster-father came from GodfreyCass.When the old stone-pit by Marner's cottage went dry owing to drainageoperations the skeleton of Dunstan Cass was found wedged between twogreat stones. The watch and seals were recognised and all the weaver'smoney was at the bottom of the pit. The shock of this discovery movedGodfrey to tell Nancy the secret of his earlier marriage."Everything comes to light Nancy sooner or later" he said. "Thatwoman Marner found dead in the snow--Eppie's mother--was my wife. Eppieis my child. I oughtn't to have left the child unowned. I oughtn't tohave kept it from you.""It's but little wrong to me Godfrey" Nancy answered sadly. "You'vemade it up to me--you've been good to me for fifteen years. It'll be adifferent coming to us now she's grown up."They were childless and it hadn't occurred to them as they approachedSilas Marner's cottage that Godfrey's offer might be declined. At firstGodfrey explained that he and his wife wanted to adopt Eppie in place ofa daughter."Eppie my child speak" said old Marner faintly. "I won't stand inyour way. Thank Mr. and Mrs. Cass.""Thank you ma'am--thank you sir" said Eppie dropping a curtsy "but Ican't leave my father nor own anybody nearer than him."Godfrey Cass was irritated at this obstacle."But I've a claim on you Eppie" he returned. "It's my duty Marner toown Eppie as my child and provide for her. She's my own child. Hermother was my wife. I've a natural claim on her.""Then sir why didn't you say so sixteen years ago and claim herbefore I'd come to love her i'stead o' coming to take her from me nowwhen you might as well take the heart out o' my body When a man turns ablessing from his door it falls to them as take it in. But let it be asyou will. Speak to the child. I'll hinder nothing.""Eppie my dear" said Godfrey looking at his daughter not without someembarrassment "it'll always be our wish that you should show your loveand gratitude to one who's been a father to you so many years but wehope you'll come to love us as well and though I haven't been what afather should ha' been to you all these years I wish to do the utmostin my power for you now and provide for you as my only child. And
comment634,you'll have the best of mothers in my wife."Eppie did not come forward and curtsy as she had done before but sheheld Silas's hand in hers and grasped it firmly."Thank you ma'am--thank you sir for your offers--they're very greatand far above my wish. For I should have no delight in life any more ifI was forced to go away from my father."In vain Nancy expostulated mildly."I can't feel as I've got any father but one" said Eppie. "I've alwaysthought of a little home where he'd sit i' the corner and I should fendand do everything for him. I can't think o' no other home. I wasn'tbrought up to be a lady and" she ended passionately "I'm promised tomarry a working man as'll live with father and help me to take care ofhim."Godfrey Cass and his wife went out.A year later Eppie was married and Mrs. Godfrey Cass provided thewedding dress and Mr. Cass made some necessary alterations to suitSilas's larger family."Oh father" said Eppie when the bridal party returned from thechurch "what a pretty home ours is I think nobody could be happierthan we are"                                   The Mill on the Floss     In "The Mill on the Floss" published in 1860 George Eliot     went to her own early life for the chief characters in the     story and in the relations of Tom and Maggie Tulliver we get     a picture of the youth of Mary Ann Evans and her brother     Isaac. Lord Lytton objected that Maggie was too passive in the     scene at Red Deeps and that the tragedy of the flood was not     adequately prepared. To this criticism George Eliot answered     "Now that the defect is suggested to me if the book were     still in manuscript I should alter or rather expand that     scene at Red Deeps." She also admitted that there was "a want     of proportionate fulness" in the conclusion. But with all its     faults "The Mill on the Floss" deserves the reputation it has     won. The reception of the story at first was disappointing     and we find the authoress telling her publisher that "she does     not want to see any newspaper articles." But the book made its     way and prepared an ever-growing public for "Silas Marner."_I.--The Tullivers of Dorlcote Mill_"What I want you know" said Mr. Tulliver "what I want is to give Toma good eddication--an eddication as'll be a bread to him. I mean to puthim to a downright good school at midsummer. The two years at th'
comment635,academy 'ud ha' done well enough if I'd meant to make a miller andfarmer of him but I should like Tom to be a bit of a scholard. It 'udbe a help to me wi' these lawsuits and arbitrations and things. Iwouldn't make a downright lawyer o' the lad--I should be sorry for himto be a raskill--but a sort of engineer or a surveyor or an auctioneerand vallyer like Riley or one o' them smartish businesses as are allprofits and no outlay only for a big watch-chain and a high stool.They're pretty nigh all one and they're not far off being even wi' thelaw I believe for Riley looks Lawyer Wakem i' the face as hard as onecat looks another. _He's_ none frightened at him."Mr. Tulliver was speaking to his wife a blonde comely woman nearlyforty years old."Well Mr. Tulliver you know best. _I've_ no objections. But if Tom'sto go to a new school I should like him to go where I can wash him andmend him else he might as well have calico as linen. And then when thebox is goin' backwards and forwards I could send the lad a cake or apork-pie or an apple.""Well well we won't send him out o' reach o' the carrier's cart ifother things fit in" said Mr. Tulliver. "Riley's as likely a man as anyto know o' some school he's had schooling himself an' goes about toall sorts o' places--arbitratin' and vallyin' and that."So a day or two later Mr. Riley the auctioneer came to Dorlcote Milland stayed the night the better that Mr. Tulliver who was slow atcoming to a point might consult him on the all-important subject of hisboy."You see I want to put him to a new school at midsummer" said Mr.Tulliver when the topic had been reached. "I want to send him to adownright good school where they'll make a scholard of him. I don'tmean Tom to be a miller an' farmer. I see no fun i' that. I shall giveTom an eddication and put him to a business as he may make a nest forhimself an' not want to push me out o' mine."At the sound of her brother's name Maggie the second and only otherchild of the Tullivers who was seated on a low stool close by the firewith a large book open on her lap looked up eagerly. Tom it appearedwas supposed capable of turning his father out of doors. This was not to
comment636,be borne and Maggie jumped up from her stool and going up between herfather's knees said in a half-crying half-indignant voice "FatherTom wouldn't be naughty to you ever I know he wouldn't."Mr. Tulliver's heart was touched."What They mustn't say any harm o' Tom eh" he said looking at Maggiewith a twinkling eye. Then in a lower voice turning to Mr. Riley "Sheunderstands what one's talking about so as never was. And you shouldhear her read--straight off as if she knowed it all beforehand. Butit's bad--it's bad. A woman's no business wi' being so clever it'llturn to trouble I doubt. It's a pity but what she'd been thelad--she'd ha' been a match for the lawyers she would."Mr. Riley took a pinch of snuff before he said "But your lad's notstupid is he I saw him when I was here last busy makingfishing-tackle he seemed quite up to it.""Well he isn't not to say stupid he's got a notion o' things out o'door an' a sort o' commonsense as he'd lay hold o' things by the righthandle. But he's slow with his tongue you see and reads but poorlyand can't abide the books and spells all wrong they tell me an' asshy as can be wi' strangers. Now what I want is to send him to a schoolwhere they'll make him a bit nimble with his tongue and his pen to makea smart chap of him. I want my son to be even wi' these fellows as havegot the start o' me with schooling."The talk ended in Mr. Riley recommending a country parson named Stellingas a suitable tutor for Tom and Mr. Tulliver decided that his sonshould go to Mr. Stelling at King's Lorton fifteen miles from DorlcoteMill._II.--School-Time_Tom Tulliver's sufferings during the first quarter he was at King'sLorton under the distinguished care of the Rev. Walter Stelling wererather severe. It had been very difficult for him to reconcile himselfto the idea that his school-time was to be prolonged and that he wasnot to be brought up to his father's business which he had alwaysthought extremely pleasant for it was nothing but riding about givingorders and going to market.Mr. Stelling was not a harsh-tempered or unkind man--quite the contrarybut he thought Tom a stupid boy and determined to develop his powersthrough Latin grammar and Euclid to the best of his ability.As for Tom he had no distinct idea how there came to be such a thing asLatin on this earth. It would have taken a long while to make itconceivable to him that there ever existed a people who bought and soldsheep and oxen and transacted the everyday affairs of life through themedium of this language or why he should be called upon to learn itwhen its connection with those affairs had become entirely latent. Hewas of a very firm not to say obstinate disposition but there was nobrute-like rebellion or recklessness in his nature the humansensibilities predominated and he was anxious to acquire Mr. Stelling'sapprobation by showing some quickness at his lessons if he had knownhow to accomplish it.In his secret heart Tom yearned to have Maggie with him and before the
comment637,first dreary half-year was ended Maggie actually came. Mrs. Stellinghad given a general invitation for the little girl to come and stay withher brother so when Mr. Tulliver drove over to King's Lorton late inOctober Maggie came too with the sense that she was taking a greatjourney and beginning to see the world."Well my lad" Mr. Tulliver said "you look rarely School agrees withyou""I don't think I _am_ well father" said Tom "I wish you'd ask Mr.Stelling not to let me do Euclid--it brings on the toothache I think.""Euclid my lad--why what's that" said Mr. Tulliver."Oh I don't know It's definitions and axioms and triangles and things.It's a book I've got to learn in--there's no sense in it.""Go go" said Mr. Tulliver reprovingly. "You mustn't say so. You mustlearn what your master tells you. He knows what it's right for you tolearn."In the second term Mr. Stelling had a second pupil--Philip the son ofLawyer Wakem Mr. Tulliver's standing enemy.Philip was a very old-looking boy Tom thought. His spine had beendeformed through an accident in infancy and to Tom he was simply ahumpback. He had a vague notion that the deformity of Wakem's son hadsome relation to the lawyer's rascality of which he had so often heardhis father talk with hot emphasis.There was a natural antipathy of temperament between the two boys forTom was an excellent bovine lad and Philip was sensitive and sufferedacute pain when the other blurted out offensive things.Maggie on her second visit to King's Lorton pronounced Philip to be "anice boy.""He couldn't choose his father you know" she said to Tom. "And I'veread of very bad men who had good sons as well as good parents who hadbad children.""Oh he's a queer fellow" said Tom curtly "and he's as sulky as can bewith me because I told him his father was a rogue. And I'd a right totell him so for it was true--and he began it with calling me names."An accident to Tom's foot brought the two boys nearer again and alsothrew Philip and Maggie together."Maggie" said Philip one day "if you had had a brother like me do youthink you should have loved him as well as Tom""Oh yes better" she answered immediately. "No not better because Idon't think I could love you better than Tom. But I should be sosorry--so sorry for you."Philip coloured. He had meant to imply would she love him as well inspite of his deformity and yet when she alluded to it so plainly hewinced under her pity. Maggie young as she was felt her mistake."But you are so very clever Philip and you can play and sing" sheadded quickly. "I wish you were my brother. I'm very fond of you.""But you'll go away soon and go to school Maggie and then you'll
comment638,forget all about me and not care for me any more.""Oh no I shan't forget you I'm sure." And Maggie put her arm roundhis neck and kissed him quite earnestly._III.--The Downfall_When Tom had turned sixteen and Maggie three years younger was atboarding school came the downfall of the Tullivers. A long andexpensive law-suit concerning rights of water brought by Mr. Tulliverended in defeat. Wakem was his opponent's lawyer.Maggie broke the news to Tom. Not only would mill and lands andeverything be lost and nothing left but their father had fallen offhis horse and knew nobody and seemed to have lost his senses."They say Mr. Wakem has got a mortgage or something on the land Tom"said Maggie on their way home from King's Lorton. "It was the letterwith that news in it that made father ill they think.""I believe that scoundrel's been planning all along to ruin my father"said Tom leaping from the vaguest impressions to a definite conclusion."I'll make him feel for it when I'm a man. Mind you never speak toPhilip again"For more than two months Mr. Tulliver lay ill in his room oblivious toall that was taking place around him. From time to time recognition cameto him of his wife and family but there was no remembrance of recentevents.The mill and land of the Tullivers were sold to Wakem the lawyer andthe bulk of their household goods were disposed of by public auctionbut the Tullivers were not turned out of Dorlcote Mill. And indeedwhen Mr. Tulliver known to be a man of proud honesty was once moreable to be up and about it was proposed that he should remain andaccept employment as manager of the mill for Mr. Wakem.It was with difficulty that poor Tulliver could bring himself to acceptthe situation but he saw the possibility by much pinching of savingmoney out of the thirty shillings a week salary promised by Wakem andpaying a second dividend to his creditors. The strongest influence ofall was the love of the old premises where he had run about when he wasa boy just as Tom had done after him.Tom who had at once applied to his Uncle Deane partner in a wealthymerchant's business for work and was now earning a pound a week hadprotested against entertaining the proposition he shouldn't like hisfather to be under Wakem he thought it would look nothing but meanspirited.But Mr. Tulliver had come to a decision. The first evening of his newlife downstairs he called his family round him and began to speaklooking first at his wife."I've made up my mind Bessy. I'll stop in the old place and I'll serveunder Wakem and I'll serve him like an honest man there's no Tulliverbut what's honest mind that Tom. They'll have it to throw up againstme as I paid a dividend--but it wasn't my fault--it was because there'sraskills in the world. They've been too many for me and I must give in.But I'll serve him as honest as if he was no raskill. I'm an honest manthough I shall never hold my head up no more I'm a tree as is broke--atree as is broke."He paused and looked on the ground. Then suddenly raising his head hesaid in a louder yet deeper tone "But I won't forgive him I know whatthey say--he never meant me any harm I shouldn't ha' gone to law theysay. But who made it so as there was no arbitrating and no justice to begot It signifies nothing to him--I know that he's one o' them finegentlemen as get money by doing business for poorer folks and when he'smade beggars of 'em he'll give 'em charity. I won't forgive him I wishhe might be punished with shame till his own son 'ud like to forget him.And you mind this Tom--you never forgive him neither if you mean tobe my son. Now write--write it i' the Bible""Oh father what" said Maggie. "It's wicked to curse and bear malice.""It isn't wicked I tell you" said her father fiercely. "It's wickedas the raskills should prosper--it's the devil's doing. Do as I tellyou Tom Write."The big Bible was open at the beginning where many family entries were
comment639,put down."What am I to write father" said Tom with gloomy submission."Write as your father Edward Tulliver took service under John Wakemthe man as had helped to ruin him because I'd promised my wife to makeher what amends I could and because I wanted to die in th' old placewhere I was born and my father was born. Put that i' the rightwords--you know how--and then write as I don't forgive Wakem for allthat and for all I'll serve him honest I wish evil may befall him.Write that."There was a dead silence as Tom's pen moved along the paper."Now let me hear what you've wrote" said Mr. Tulliver and Tom readaloud slowly."Now write--write as you'll remember what Wakem's done to your fatherand you'll make him and his feel it if ever the day comes. And signyour name--Thomas Tulliver""Oh no father dear father" said Maggie trembling like a leaf. "Youshouldn't make Tom write that""Be quiet Maggie" said Tom impatiently "I shall write it"_IV.--In Death They Were Not Divided_The Red Deeps was always a favourite place to Maggie to walk in. An oldstone quarry so long exhausted that both mounds and hollows were nowclothed with brambles and trees and with here and there a stretch ofgrass which a few sheep kept close nibbled. This was the Red Deeps andit was here in June that Maggie once more met Philip Wakem five yearsafter their first meeting at Mr. Stelling's. He told her that she wasmuch more beautiful than he had thought she would be and assured herin answer to the difficulties she raised as to their meeting that therewas no enmity in his father's mind.And Maggie went home with an inward conflict already begun and Philipwent home to do nothing but remember and hope.In the following April they met again after Philip had been abroad.And now he took her hand and asked her the simple question "_Do_ youlove me""I think I could hardly love anyone better there is nothing but what Ilove you for" Maggie answered. But she pointed out how impossible eventheir friendship was if it were discovered.Philip on his side refused to give up hope and before they partedthat day she had kissed him.Tom intervened before the next visit to the Red Deeps. He had heard thatPhilip Wakem had been seen there with his sister and Maggie admittedon his questioning her that she had told Philip that she loved him."Now then Maggie" Tom said coldly "there are but two courses for youto take. Either you vow solemnly to me with your hand on father'sBible that you will never have another meeting or speak another word inprivate to Philip Wakem or you refuse and I tell my father everything"In vain Maggie pleaded. Tom was obdurate and she repeated the words ofrenunciation.But that was not enough for Tom Tulliver he accompanied Maggie to RedDeeps and in a voice of harsh scorn told Philip that he had been takinga mean unmanly advantage."It was for my father's sake Philip" said Maggie imploringly. "Tomthreatens to tell my father--and he couldn't bear it. I have promised Ihave vowed solemnly that we will not have any intercourse without mybrother's knowledge.""It is enough Maggie. _I_ shall not change but I wish you to holdyourself entirely free. But trust me--remember that I can never seek foranything but good to what belongs to you."Tom only replied with angry contempt and led Maggie away. All hissister's remonstrances he answered with cold obstinacy.For his character in its strength was hard. Tom had laboured to one end
comment640,in these years to pay off his father's creditors and regain DorlcoteMill. By his industry and by some successful private ventures in tradethe day came when the first of the objects was realised and Mr.Tulliver lived to see himself free of debt.But Mr. Tulliver's satisfaction was short-lived. Excited by the dinnergiven to celebrate the payment of his creditors he met Mr. Wakem nearthe mill. From angry words it came to blows and Tulliver fell on thelawyer furiously only ceasing from attack when Maggie and Mrs. Tulliverappeared. Wakem went off without serious injury but Tulliver only livedthrough the night the excitement had killed him."You must take care of her Tom" said the dying man turning to hisdaughter. "You'll manage to pay for a brick grave Tom so as yourmother and me can lie together This world's...too many...honest man..."At last there was total stillness and poor Tulliver's dimly lightedsoul had ceased to be vexed with the painful riddle of this world.Tom and Maggie went downstairs together and Maggie spoke. "Tom forgiveme let us always love each other"--and they clung and wept together.But they were not to be always united.Tom lived in lodgings in the town and was anxious to provide for hissister but Maggie preferred to take up teaching in her old boarding-school. She met Philip Wakem again and though Tom released her from herold promise he could not regard Philip with any feelings of friendship.It was when Tom had by years of steady work fulfilled his father'swishes and become once more master of Dorlcote Mill that Maggiereturned--to be no more separated from her brother. She was staying inthe town near the river on the night when the flood came and the riverrose beyond its banks. Her first thought as the water entered the lowerpart of the house was of the mill where Tom was. There was no time toget assistance she must go herself and alone. Hastily she procured aboat and at last reached the mill. The water was up to the first storybut still the mill stood firm."Tom where are you Here is Maggie" she called out in a loudpiercing voice. Tom opened the middle window and got into the boat. Tomrowed with vigour but a new danger was before them in the river."Get out of the current" was shouted at them but it could not be done
comment641,at once. Huge fragments of machinery swept off one of the wharvesblocked the stream in one wide mass and the current swept the boatswiftly on to its doom."It is coming Maggie" Tom said in a deep hoarse voice loosing theoars and clasping her.The next instant the boat was no longer seen upon the water and brotherand sister had gone down in an embrace never to be parted livingthrough again in one supreme moment the days when they had clasped theirlittle hands in love."In their death they were not divided."                                   ERCKMANN-CHATRIANWaterloo     Emile Erckmann was born at Phalsbourg in Alsace on May 20     1822 and Alexandre Chatrian at Soldatenthal on December 18     1826. Erckmann the son of a bookseller became a law student     and was admitted to the Bar in 1858. But the law studies were     always uncongenial and Erckmann meeting Chatrian as a fellow     student in the gymnasium at Phalsbourg the two young men     decided to join forces in authorship. The Erckmann-Chatrian     partnership lasted from 1860 to 1885 and resulted in a     remarkable series of novels short stories plays and operas.     "Waterloo" was published in 1865 and has enjoyed a wide     popularity in many languages. Like "The Conscript" its     predecessor the charm of "Waterloo" consists largely in the     character of Joseph Bertha the young clockmaker of     Phalsbourg who tells the story. Bertha is a peaceful citizen     who hates war and has no taste for glory. Yet he is nothing of     a coward and behaves like a man when he is forced to fight.     To the student of history the light thrown on the rise and     fall of the Bourbon popularity in France 1813-14 in this     novel will always be of interest. Chatrian died in Paris on     September 4 1890 and Erckmann at Luneville on March 14     1899._I.--Napoleon Returns_Never was anything so joyous as the spring of 1814 Louis XVIII. wasking and the war was over. All except the old soldiers were contentand only when the nobles who had fled at the Revolution returned andit was said that they were going to bring back all their old ideas didM. Goulden express any dissatisfaction. There were great religiousprocessions everywhere and expiatory services and talk of rebuildingall the convents and setting up the nobles again in their castles. Butthese things did not trouble me because I was married to Catherine andknew nothing about politics.The treatment of the old soldiers enraged me. On the day of thereligious procession at Phalsbourg half a dozen old veterans restoredprisoners were set upon in our town by that rascal Pinacle and thepeople of Baraques and knocked about. Pinacle did this to curry favourwith Louis XVIII. and M. Goulden warned us that if ruffians likePinacle got the upper hand it would open people's eyes.Sure enough Pinacle received the cross of honour in the autumn when theDuc de Berry came to review the troops at Phalsbourg and even AuntGrdel who was fond of abusing Napoleon and the Jacobins andapplauding the king and the clergy thought this a shameful thing.It really was scandalous the way titles and honours were given toworthless people who shouted for the king. Worse than this was the wayNapoleon's old officers were treated. Men who had fought and bled forFrance for twenty years were now well-nigh starving driven out of thearmy to make room for the king's favourites.We read all this in the "Gazette" and Zbd who had come back aliveand in time for my wedding and was still in the army would often comein and tell us of the growing indignation of the soldiers. The whole ofthat winter the indignation was spreading in the town at the sight of so
comment642,many brave officers the heroes of Marengo Austerlitz and Wagramwandering forlornly about starving on half-pay and deprived of theirposts.How well I remember one day in January 1815 two of these officerspale and gaunt coming into the workshop to sell a watch.M. Goulden examined the watch with great care and said "Do not beoffended gentlemen I too served France under the Republic and Iknow it must cut to the heart to be forced to sell something whichrecalls sacred memories.""It was given me by Prince Eugne" said one of the officers CommandantMargarot a hussar."It is worth more than 1000 francs" said M. Goulden "and I cannotafford to buy it. But I will advance you 200 francs and the watch shallremain here if you like and shall be yours whenever you come to reclaimit."The old hussar broke down at this and though his comrade ColonelFalconette tried to restrain him he poured forth thanks and bitterwords against the government.From that time it always seemed to me that things would end badly andthat the nobles had gone too far. The old commandant had said that thegovernment behaved like Cossacks to the army and this was horrible.M. Goulden read the "Gazette" aloud to us every day and both Catherineand I were pleased to find there were men in Paris maintaining the verythings we thought ourselves.All this time the clergy were going on with their processions andsermons were being preached about the rebellion of 1790 the restitutionof property to the landowners and the re-establishment of convents andthe need for missionaries for the conversion of France. From such ideaswhat good could comeIt is no wonder that when a report came early in March that Napoleon hadlanded at Cannes and was marching on Paris we were all very agitated atPhalsbourg."It is plain" said M. Goulden "that the emperor will reach Paris. Thesoldiers are for him so are the peasantry whose property isthreatened and so are the middle classes provided he will maketreaties of peace."_II.--"Vive l'Empereur"_For some days though all knew Napoleon had set foot in France no onedared talk of it aloud. Only the looks of the half-pay officers betrayedtheir anxiety. If they had possessed horses and arms I am sure theywould have set out to meet their emperor.On March 8 Zbd entered our house and said abruptly "The two firstbatallions are starting.""They are going to stop him" said M. Goulden.
comment643,"Yes they'll stop him that is very likely" Zbd answered winking.At the foot of the stairs he drew me aside and whispered "Look insidemy cap Joseph all the soldiers have got it too."Sure enough it was the old tricolour cockade which had been removed onthe return of Louis XVIII.At last the papers had to admit that Buonaparte had escaped from Elba.What a scene it was in the caf the night the papers arrived M. Gouldenand I were hardly seated before the place was filled with people and itwas so close the windows had to be opened.Commandant Margarot mounted on a table with other officers all aroundhim and began to read the "Gazette" aloud. It took a long time thereading and the people laughed and jeered at the passages that said thetroops were faithful to the king that Buonaparte was surrounded andwould soon be taken and that the illustrious Ney and the other marshalshad hastened to place their swords at the service of the king. Thecommandant read on firmly in that distinct voice of his until he came tothe order calling upon the French to seize Buonaparte and give him updead or alive.Then his whole face changed and his eyes glittered. He took the"Gazette" up and tore it into little pieces and drawing himself uphis long arms stretched out cried "Vive l'Empereur" with all hismight. Immediately all the half-pay officers took up the cry and "Vivel'Empereur" was repeated again by the very soldiers posted outside thetown hall when they heard the shout.The commandant was carried shoulder high round the caf and everyonewas now calling out "Vive l'Empereur" I saw the tears in the eyes ofthe commandant tears at hearing the name he loved best acclaimed oncemore.As for me I felt as if cold water was being forced down my back. "It'sall over" I said to myself. "It's no good talking about peace."But M. Goulden was more hopeful and after we got home spoke cheerfullyof the blessings of liberty and a good constitution.Aunt Grdel did not take this view. She came to see us the morning afterthe scene in the caf when all the town was discussing the great newsand began at once "So it seems the villain has run away from hisisland"Both M. Goulden and I were anxious to avoid a dispute for Aunt Grdelwas really angry and she couldn't leave the subject.M. Goulden admitted that he preferred Napoleon to the Bourbons withtheir nobles and missionary priests because the emperor was bound torespect the national property whereas the later would have destroyedall that the Revolution had accomplished. "Still I am now and alwaysshall be till death for the Republic and the rights of man" M. Gouldenconcluded.The old gentleman took his hat and went out to escape further argumentand Aunt Grdel turned to me and told me that M. Goulden was an old fooland always had been and that I should have to go to Switzerland nowunless Buonaparte was taken before he reached Paris.In the evening however when Aunt Grdel had gone and we three weretogether Catherine said quietly "M. Goulden is right he knows moreabout these things than my mother does and we will always listen to hisadvice."I thought to myself "Yes that's all very well but it will be a
comment644,horrible thing to have to put on one's knapsack again and be off. Iwould rather be in Switzerland than in Leipzig."Each day now brought news of Napoleon's advance from Grenoble to Lyonsfrom Lyons to Macon and Auxerre. There was no opposition anywhere to hisprogress and the only question that troubled M. Goulden's mind was theattitude of Ney to the emperor. Could Ney an old soldier of theRevolution though he had kissed the hand of Louis XVIII. betray thecountry to please the king The uneasiness disappeared when we learntthat Ney had followed the example of the army the citizens and of allwho did not wish to go back to the customs and laws of twenty-five yearsearlier.On March 21 just as it was getting dark we knew that somethingdecisive must have happened at Paris. The drums were calling to arms inthe market-place and a great crowd soon assembled.The soldiers fell into their ranks Commandant Gmeau who had only justrecovered from his wounds drew his sword and gave the order to formsquare.M. Goulden and I got on a bench to listen we knew that the fate ofFrance depended on the message we were to hear."Present arms" called out the commandant in the same clear voice whichhad bidden us at Ltzen and Leipzig "Close up your ranks"Then came the news we had been waiting for."Soldiers his Majesty Louis XVIII. left Paris on March 20 and theEmperor Napoleon entered the capital the same day."For a second there was a dead silence and then the commandant spoke ofthe banner of France the banner of Marengo Austerlitz and Jenastained with our blood and the old sergeant drew out the tatteredtricolour flag from its case."I know no other flag" cried the commandant raising his sword. "Vivela France Vive l'Empereur"What a shout there was of "Vive l'Empereur Vive la France" at this.The people and the soldiers embraced one another and that night and forthe next five or six days there was if anything even more rejoicingthan there had been on the return of Louis XVIII. We still hoped for thecontinuance of peace but who could say how long the peace would lastPhalsbourg was ordered to put itself into a state of defence a largeworkshop was set up at the arsenal for the repairing of arms andengineers and artillerymen came over from Metz to make earthworks in thefortifications. It seemed to me that a large number of men would berequired for all the guns and forts and that my watchmaking days wouldsoon be exchanged for active service. I began to think that after allreligious processions were better than being sent to fight againstpeople one knew nothing about._III.--On the Road to Waterloo_Aunt Grdel had not been to see us for a month and it was a greatcomfort to Catherine and me when one Sunday M. Goulden proposed that weshould all three pay her a visit at Quatre Vents. As soon as she saw usAunt Grdel rushed to kiss her daughter and called out "You are a goodman M. Goulden better a thousand times than I am. How glad I am to seeyou It doesn't matter about being a Jacobin or anything else the mainthing is to have a good heart."It was not until the afternoon that M. Goulden explained that he hadknown for some days that I should be called up to rejoin my oldregiment and that he had arranged with the commandant of artillery thatI should be received at the arsenal as a workman. What relief this wasto us for I could not bear the thought of separation from Catherine. Sofrom that day I went to work at the arsenal and Aunt Grdel came to seeus again as she had been accustomed to do.It can be guessed with what spirit I worked at the arsenal and howpleased I was when the commandant expressed satisfaction at my work. But
comment645,I was not allowed to stop at Phalsbourg.On May 23 the commandant told me that I must go to Metz with the 3rdbattalion to which I belonged. He assured me however that I should bekept at Metz in the workshops and we all did our best to believe that Iwas fortunate in my destination. M. Goulden however warned me before Ileft that France was threatened by her enemies that the allies wouldmake no peace with the emperor but were determined to set Louis XVIII.once more on the throne and that now the question was not of invadingother countries but of defending our own.Catherine was asleep when the morning came for my departure and I wasglad to escape the pain of saying "good-bye." At the barracks Zbdwho was now a sergeant led me into the soldiers' room and I put on myuniform. Then the battalion defiled through the gates the soldiers atthe outworks presented arms and we were on the way to Waterloo.It was useless to think of stopping in Metz. We arrived in that city ofJews and soldiers after five days' march and were at once after ournight's rest supplied with ammunition. I saw that my only chance ofstaying at the workshops of Metz would be after the campaign was overfor we were on the march the very next morning. Zbd was not alwayswith me now and my closest comrade was Jean Buche the son of asledge-maker at Harberg who had never eaten anything better thanpotatoes before he became a conscript. Buche turned in his feet inwalking but he never seemed to know the meaning of being tired and inhis own fashion was a wonderful pedestrian.From Metz we marched through Thionville Chtelet Etain DannevouxYong Vivier and Cul-de-Sard. All our troops were pouring intoBelgium--cavalry infantry and artillery--and though there were nosigns of the enemy it was reported that we were to attack the English.I thought as well English as Prussians Austrians or Russians since wewere to kill each other.On the night of June 14 we bivouacked outside the village of Roly andGeneral Pcheux read a proclamation by the emperor reminding us thatthis was the anniversary of Marengo that the powers were in coalitionagainst France and that the hour had come for France to conquer orperish.It is impossible to describe the enthusiasm at this message from theemperor our courage was stronger and the conscripts were even moreanxious than the veterans for the fighting to begin.We were up at daybreak next day and on the march eager to get a sightof the Prussians who had been repulsed from Charleroi by the emperorwe were told. At the village of Chtelet we halted and heard the noiseof firing away across the River Sambre in the direction of Gilly. Anold bald peasant told us that evening that the Prussians had men in thevillages of Fleurus and Lambusart that the English and Belgians were onthe great Brussels road and that the causeway through Quatre Bras andLigny enabled the Prussians and English to communicate freely with eachother. He also told us that the Prussians said insulting things of theFrench army and were generally hated by the people. When I heard of theway the Prussians boasted my blood boiled and I said to myself "Thereshall be no more compassion. Either they or we must be utterlydestroyed."I can recall with what splendour the sun rose next morning above acornfield--it was the morning of the battle of Ligny. Zbd and one ortwo comrades whom I had known in 1813 came and chattered while we litour fires. We could see the Prussians before us posting themselvesbehind hedges and walls and preparing to defend the villages and allthe time we were kept roasting in the corn waiting for the signal toattack. The emperor arrived and held a short conference with thesuperior officers and I saw him at close quarters before he rode offagain to the village of Fleurus already vacated by the Prussians.And still we waited though we knew the attack on St. Amand had begun.At last came our turn to advance on Ligny. "Forward Forward" cried theofficers. "Vive l'Empereur" we shouted. The Prussian bullets whizzedlike hail upon us and then we could see or hear nothing till we were in
comment646,the village.No quarter was given that day we fought in houses and gardens in barnsand lanes with muskets and bayonets. Those who fell were lost. At onetime fifteen of us were in possession of a barn and the Prussians fora time outnumbering us drove us up a ladder. They fired up at ourfloor and finally when it seemed we were lost and were all to bemassacred we heard the shout of "Vive l'Empereur" and the Prussiansfled. Out of that fifteen only six were left alive but Zbd and Buchewere among the survivors.The battle still raged in the village streets dead and dying wereeverywhere. Towards nightfall it was plain we were the victors Lignyand St. Amand were in our hands and the Prussians had moved away. Onthe plateau behind Ligny where our cavalry had been at work theslaughter had been terrible.The dozen or so remaining of our company rested for a few hours thatnight in the ruins of a farmhouse and next day came the roll-call ofour battalion and the sending off of the wounded. More than 360 of ourmen including Commandant Gmeau and Captain Vidal were disabled andwe were busy all day over the wounded.It was wet and muddy that evening and we were hungry and dispiritedwhen we reached Quatre Bras about eight o'clock. We were not allowed tohalt here but marched on to a village called Jemappes and at midnightwe settled down in a furrow to wait for morning.The red coats of the English were visible before us when we awoke nextmorning behind their lines was the village of Mont St. Jean and theyhad also the farmhouses of La Haie-Sainte and Hougomont. At six o'clockI looked at their position with Zbd Captain Florentin and Bucheand it seemed to me it was a difficult task before us. It was Sundayand I could hear the bells of villages recalling Phalsbourg. But in avery little while we heard no more bells for at half-past eight ourbattalion was on its way to the high road in front and the battle ofWaterloo had begun._IV.--The Hour of Disaster_I have often heard veterans describe the order of battle given by theemperor. But all I remember of that terrible day is that we marched outwith the bands playing that we got to close quarters with the Englishwere repulsed and were assisted by regiments of cuirassiers that wecarried La Haie-Sainte with terrible slaughter at Ney's command.Hougomont we could not carry. When we thought we were winning the newswas spread that Blcher with 60000 men was advancing on our flankand that unless Grouchy with his 30000 arrived in time to reinforceus the day might be lost.All the world knows now that Grouchy did not arrive that we threwourselves again and again upon the English squares and that at lastwhen regiment after regiment had tried in vain to break the enemy'sline the Old Guard were called up by the emperor. It was the lastchance of retrieving the day the grand stroke--and it failed.The four battalions of the Guards reduced from 3000 to 1200 men wereassailed by so fierce a fire that they were compelled to retire. Theyretired slowly defending themselves with muskets and bayonets but withtheir retirement and the approach of night the battle ended for us inthe confusion of a rout. It was like a flood. We were surrounded on allsides when Blcher arrived. The Old Guard formed a square for theemperor and his officers and the rest of us simply straggled away backto France. The most awful thing of all was the beating of the drum ofthe Old Guard in that hour of disaster. It was like a fire-bell thelast appeal of a burning nation.Buche was by my side in the retreat. Several times the Prussiansattacked us. We heard that the emperor had departed for Paris and westruggled on only hoping to escape with our lives. At Charleroi theinhabitants shut the city gates in our face and Buche shared in thegeneral rage and proposed to destroy the town. But I thought we had hadenough massacres and that it was not right we should be killing our own
comment647,countrymen and I persuaded Buche to come on with me.In a few days we felt ourselves safe from pursuing Prussians and at thevillage of Bouvigny I wrote a letter to Catherine telling her I wassafe. In this village some officers of our regiment the 6th of theLine found us and we had to rejoin. Presently we saw all that was leftof Grouchy's army corps in retreat and a day or two later we heard ofthe emperor's abdication. On July 1 we reached Paris and outside thecity near the village of Issy we once more fell in with the Prussiansfor two days we fought them with fury and then some generals announcedthat peace had been made.We believed that this truce was to give the enemy time to leave thecountry and that otherwise France would rise as it rose in '92 anddrive them out.Unhappily we soon learnt that the Prussians and English were to occupyParis and that the remains of the French army were to be kept beyondthe Loire. We all felt that we had been betrayed and the old officerspale with anger wept in their misery. Paris in the hands of thePrussians Besides were we to go to the other side of the Loire at thecommand of BlcherDesertions began that very day and I said to Buche "Let us return toPhalsbourg and Harberg and take up our work and live like honest men."About fifty of us from Alsace-Lorraine were in the battalion and we setoff together on the road to Strasbourg.On July 8 we heard that Louis XVIII. was to come back and already thewhite banner of the Bourbons was being displayed in the villages.In some places there were rascals who called us Buonapartists andgendarmes who took us to the town hall and made us shout "Vive le Roi"Buche and some of the old soldiers hated this but what did it matterwho was king and what these fools wanted us to shoutOur little company got smaller and smaller as men halted in their ownvillages and when on July 16 we reached Phalsbourg Buche and I werealone.Buche went on to break the news of my return but I could not wait andran after him.I heard people saying "There's Joseph Bertha" and in a moment I wasin the house and in Catherine's arms. Then I embraced M. Goulden andan hour later Aunt Grdel arrived.Jean Buche would not stay and dine with us but hurried home to Harberg.I have often seen him since and Zbd too who remained in the army.Many insulting things were said about us by the Pinacles but I hadhappiness in my family circle especially when Catherine presented mewith a little Joseph.I am an old man now but M. Goulden always said the principles offreedom and liberty would triumph and I have lived long enough to seehis words come true.                                   OCTAVE FEUILLETRomance of a Poor Young Man     Octave Feuillet born at Saint L in France on August 11     1821 was the son of a Norman gentleman who regarded     literature as an ignoble profession. When Octave ran away to     Paris in order to pursue a literary career his father refused     to help him and for some years the young writer had a very     hard struggle. But on taking to novel-writing Feuillet     quickly acquired fame and fortune. His "Romance of a Poor     Young Man" "Le Roman d'un Jeune Homme Pauvre" which     appeared in 1858 made him the most popular author of the day.     Standing midway between the novelists of the romantic school     and the writers of the realistic movement he combined a sense     of the poetry of life with a gift for analysing the finer     shades of feeling. The plot of the "Romance of a Poor Young     Man" is certainly extraordinary but in the present case some     allowance must be made for the fact that the hero is induced     to accept the humble position in which he finds himself by his     old family lawyer who secretly designs to marry him to the     daughter of his new employers. A scheme of this sort would not     Strike a French reader as improbable for marriage in France     is often more a business arrangement than a love affair.     Feuillet spent the latter part of his life in retirement and     died on December 29 1890.
comment648,_I.--A Nobleman in Difficulties_Here I am then in the situation that Lawyer Laubpin obtained for me.I am alone at last thank goodness sitting in a gloomy room in this oldBreton castle in which the former steward to the Laroque family used tolive. My position is certainly very strange but as Laubpin wasdiscreet and did not tell his clients that he was sending them a newsteward in the person of the young Marquis of Champcey perhaps I shallnot find my post very difficult. I was afraid that the Laroques were afamily of the vulgarly rich sort like the dreadful persons who havebought my father's lands. Laroque is a picturesque figure in his oldage and though his widowed daughter-in-law is rather more commonplacehis grand-daughter Marguerite Laroque is a nobly beautiful girl.If it were not for my accursed pride I should now feel happier than Ihave ever felt since that day of disaster misery and shame whenLaubpin told me that my poor dead father had lost his fortune inspeculations and left nothing but his title and his debts. Well I havepaid the debts and if I can now only earn enough money to keep mylittle sister Hlne at school I shall not grumble at my lot. I feelthe loss of my friends it is true. There is not a soul I can confidein and I must find some outlet for the thoughts and feelings thatoppress me so I will keep this diary.It will be at least a silent confidant and perhaps when I am older Ishall be able to read with a certain pleasurable interest its record ofmy singular adventures. No other man in France on May 1 1857 can havebeen transformed so suddenly as by the wand of a witch from a powerfuland wealthy young nobleman of ancient lineage into a humble and despiseddomestic servant. Perhaps a good fairy will appear and restore me to myproper shape but I wish she had appeared at dinner this evening. Therewere twenty guests and it was the first time since the change of myfortunes that I took part in a society affair. Nobody spoke to meexcept the pretty little governess of the family Mlle. Hlouin and wewere placed at the end of the table. The position of honour was given toa young and brilliant nobleman M. de Bvallan whose estate joined thatof the Laroque family. I gathered from Mlle. Hlouin that it was hisambition to unite the two estates by marrying Mlle. Marguerite Laroque.I was therefore surprised when the lovely heiress led her grandfatherinto the room when everybody was seated placed him in a chair byBvallan and came and sat by my side.
comment649,"She can't" I thought to myself "be much in love with her wooer" andI began to study her with a certain curiosity. Her fine clear-cutfeatures and large dark eyes attracted me and by way of opening theconversation I spoke of the wildly beautiful scenery through which I hadpassed on my way to the castle. It was a bad beginning."I see" she said with a singular expression of irony "that you are apoet. You must talk about the forests and moorlands with Mlle. Hlouinwho also adores these things. For my part I do not love them.""What is it then that you really love" I said.She gave me a supercilious look and said in a hard voice "Nothingsir."I must confess I was hurt. I could not see that I had done anything tolay myself open to so harsh an answer. No doubt I was only a servant.But why had she come and sat beside me if she did not want to talk Iwas glad when the dinner was over and we went into the drawing-room.Madame Laroque the widowed mother of Marguerite began to ask M.Bvallan about the new opera in Paris he was unable to reply so as Ihad seen the work in Italy before it was produced in France I gave hera description of it. I am afraid I forgot myself with Madame Laroque--afine-looking cultivated woman of forty years of age. Flattered by theway in which she treated me entirely as her equal I insensibly glidedfrom theatrical topics to fashionable gossip and just stopped in timein an anecdote about my tour in Russia. A few more words and she wouldhave learnt that her humble steward Maxime Odiot--as I am now called--was a man with very aristocratic connections.In order to hide my embarrassment I moved towards the table where someof the guests were playing whist. This led to my committing a blunderwhich I fear may make my position a difficult one. Among the whist-players was a Mlle. de Porhoet-Gael eighty-eight years of age and fullof strange crotchets. The last descendant of the noblest of Bretonfamilies she lived so Madame Laroque told me on an income of fortypounds a year her fortune having been spent in vainly fighting for thesuccession to a great estate in Spain. She was talking about it to herpartner when I came up."The estate belongs to me" she was saying. "My father told me so ahundred times and the persons who are trying to take it from me have nomore connection with my family than this handsome young gentleman has."And she designated me with a look and a movement of her head. No doubtshe did not mean to imply that because I was a steward I was of meanbirth but I was stung by her remark and forgetting myself I repliedrather sharply "You are mistaken madam in thinking that I amunrelated to your family.""You will have to prove that to me young man."Confused and ashamed I withdrew into the corner and tried to talk toMlle. Hlouin about poetry and art but at last upset and distracted I
comment650,arose and walked out of the room. Mlle. de Porhoet followed me."Monsieur Odiot" she said "would you mind seeing me home My servanthas not arrived and I am growing too feeble now to walk without help."Naturally I went with her."What did you mean" she said as we walked on together "by claiming tobe a relation of mine""I hope" I replied very humbly "that you will pardon a jest that--""A jest" she interrupted. "Is a matter touching my honour a jest Isee a remark which would be an insult if addressed to a man becomesonly a jest when it is levelled at an old unprotected woman."After that nothing was left to me as a man of honour but to entrusther with my secret. There had been several marriages between ourfamilies and after listening with great interest to the story of mytroubles she became wonderfully kind in her manner to me."You must come and see me to-morrow cousin" she said when we parted."My law-suit is going very badly and I should like you to go through allmy papers and see if you can discover any new documents in support ofmy claim. Do not despair my dear over your own misfortunes. I think Ishall be able to help you."_II.--Love and Jealousy_I am afraid I lack the industry necessary for keeping a diary. It is nowtwo months since I wrote the last entry. If I had made every night abrief note of the events of the day I should now have a better view ofmy position. Has Mlle. de Porhoet betrayed my secret There hascertainly been a curious change in my relations with the Laroques. Ifancy it began on the day when Marguerite and I met at last on an equalfooting at Mlle. de Porhoet's house. The document which I had just thenfound may not be as important as we thought but our common joy in whatwe considered was a discovery of tremendous value brought us closertogether.But I cannot understand Marguerite. Sometimes she still goes out of herway to be insulting towards me and sometimes she treats me with a sweetfrankness which has something sisterly in it. One day for instance shecame to my window and asked me if I would go for a walk with her. "Bringyour sketch-book Monsieur Odiot" she called out gaily "and I willtake you to Merlin's Tomb in the Enchanted Valley."As a matter of fact the woods around the castle of the Laroques werethe remains of the famous forest of Broceliande and I had always beenpromising myself a long ramble through this region of romance but I hadnever found time to explore it. I was now glad I had waited forMarguerite was a charming guide. Never had I seen her so light-hearted.When we reached a great block of stone in the depth of the wood underwhich the wizard Merlin is said to be imprisoned by Vivien Margueritemade herself a garland of oak-leaves and standing like a lovelypriestess clad all in white against the Druidic monument she asked meto make a sketch of her. With what joy did I paint the poetic visionbefore me I think she was pleased with the drawing but on our way backto the castle a foolish word of mine brought our friendship to an end.We came to a picturesque little lake at the end of which was awaterfall overgrown with brambles. In order to show what a good swimmerher dog was Marguerite threw something in the current and told him tofetch it but he got carried over the waterfall and caught in thewhirlpool below."Come away He is drowning--come away I can't bear to see it" criedMarguerite seizing me by the arm. "No do not attempt to save him. Thepool is very dangerous."I am a good swimmer however and with a little trouble I managed torescue the dog."What madness" she murmured. "You might have been drowned and just fora dog"
comment651,"It was yours" I answered in a low voice.Her manner at once changed."You had better run home Monsieur Odiot" she said very coldly "or youwill get a chill. Do not wait for me."So I returned alone and for some days Marguerite never spoke a word tome. What was still worse M. Bvallan appeared at the castle and shewent for walks with him leaving me in the company of Mlle. Hlouin. Iam afraid that I became very friendly with the pretty governess.Nothing however that I ever said to her or that she said to meprepared me for the strange scene that happened to-night. As I waswalking along the terrace she came up and took my arm and said "Areyou really my friend Maxime""Yes" I said."Then tell me the truth" she exclaimed. "Do you love me or do you loveMademoiselle Marguerite""Why do you bring in her name" I said."Ah you love her" she cried fiercely "or rather you love herfortune. But you shall never have it Monsieur de Champcey. I know whyyou came here under a false name and so shall she."With a movement of anger she departed. I cannot continue here undersuspicion of being a fortune-hunter so I have written to Laubpin toobtain another situation for me._III.--Two on a Tower_It is all over. Was it because she still only half believed the slandersspread against me that Marguerite again asked me to go for a walk withher Oh what an unfortunate wretch I am We rode through the foresttogether to one of the most magnificent monuments in Brittany theCastle of Elven. Finding the door unlocked we tethered our horses inthe deserted courtyard and climbed up the narrow winding staircase tothe battlements. The sea of autumnal foliage below was bathed in thelight of the setting sun and for a long time we sat side by side insilence gazing at the infinite distances."Come" she said at last in a low whisper as the light died out of thesky. "It is finished"But on descending the dark staircase we found that the door of the keepwas locked. No doubt the shepherd boy who looked after the castle hadcome and shut up the place while we were sitting watching the sunset."Monsieur de Champcey" she said in a cold hard voice "were there anyscoundrels in your family before you""Marguerite" I cried."You paid that boy to lock us in" she exclaimed. "You think you willforce me to marry you by compromising me in this manner. Do you thinkyou will win my hand--and what is more important to you still mywretched wealth--by this trick Rather than marry a scoundrel like youI will shut myself up in a convent"Carried away by my feelings I seized her two hands and said "Nowlisten Marguerite. I love you it is true. Never did man love moredevotedly yes and more disinterestedly than I do. But I swear that ifI get out of this place alive I will never marry you until you are aspoor as I am or I as rich as you are. If you love me as I think youdo fall on your knees and pray for unless a miracle happens you willnever see me again alive."But a miracle did happen. I threw myself out of the window and fellupon a branch of an oak-tree. It bent beneath my weight and then brokebut it came so near the earth before breaking that if my left arm hadnot struck against the masonry I should have escaped uninjured. As itwas my arm was smashed and I swooned away with the pain. When I cameto Marguerite was leaning out of the window calling "Maxime speak tome For the love of heaven speak to me and say you pardon me"I arose saying "I am not hurt. If you will only wait another hour Iwill go home and get some one to let you out. Believe me I will saveyour honour as I have saved my own."Binding up my arm I got on my horse and galloped back to LaroqueCastle. On the way I met Bvallan."Have you seen Mlle. Marguerite" he said. "We are afraid she has gotlost.""I met her this afternoon" I replied. "She told me she was going for aride to Elven Castle."He rode off in the direction from which I had come and when I returnedfrom the doctor with my broken arm set and bandaged Marguerite and
comment652,Bvallan entered.Hearing that I had had an accident Madame Laroque came up late to-nightto see me. Old Laroque has had a stroke of paralysis she tells me andshe wishes to get the marriage contract between her daughter andBvallan signed to-morrow. Laubpin is bringing the document._IV.---A Test Case_I don't know why I take the trouble to go on with this diary but havingbegun it I may as well finish it. Laubpin wanted me to go into thedrawing-room to witness the signing of the marriage contract buthappily I was too ill to leave my bed not only was my arm very painfulbut I was suffering from the shock of the fall. What an hour of misery Ipassed before Mlle. de Porhoet-Gael appeared with the news of what hadhappened Her sweet kind old eyes were bright with joy."It is all over" she said. "Bvallan has gone and young Hlouin hasalso been turned out of the house."I started up with surprise."Yes" she continued with a smile "the contract has not been signed.Our friend Laubpin drew it up in such a way that the husband was notable to touch a penny of the wife's money. M. Bvallan objected to thiswhile he and his lawyer were arguing the matter with LaubpinMarguerite rose up."'Throw the contract in the fire' she said 'and mother give thisgentleman back the presents he sent to me.'"Laubpin threw the deed in the flames and Marguerite and her motherwalked out of the room."'What is the meaning of this' cried Bvallan."'I will tell you' I answered. 'A certain young lady was afraid thatyou were merely a fortune-hunter. She wanted to be certain of it andnow she is so.'"Thereupon I too left the room."But what is the matter with you my dear boy You are as pale as acorpse."The fact was that the unexpected news aroused in me such a mixture ofjoyful and painful feelings that I fell back in a swoon. When Irecovered dear old Laubpin was standing by my bed."Will you not confide in me my boy" he said rather sadly. "SomethingI can see has happened which has made you miserable on the very day onwhich you should be full of joy. What is it"Moved by his sympathy I gave him this diary to read and poured out myvery soul to him."It is useless for me" he said at last "to conceal from you the factthat I sent you here with the design to marry you to Marguerite.Everything at first went as well as I could wish and Madame Laroque wasdelighted with the match. You and Marguerite were made for each otherand you fell in love almost at first sight. But this affair at theCastle of Elven is something I had not reckoned on. To leap out of thewindow at the risk of breaking your neck was my romantic young frienda sufficient demonstration of your disinterestedness. You need not havetaken a solemn oath never to marry Marguerite until you were as rich asshe is. What can you do now You cannot forswear yourself and youcannot suddenly make an immense fortune."
comment653,"I must depart with you" I said very sorrowfully. "There is no otherway.""No Maxime" he replied "you are too unwell to move. Remain here forone month longer then if you do not hear from me return to Paris."It is now a week since he left me and I have seen no one for the lastseven days but the servant who waits upon me. He tells me that Laroquehas died and that Marguerite and her mother who have been tending himnight and day have worn themselves out and are now laid up with somesort of fever. Mlle. de Porhoet is also very ill and not expected tolive. Since I am well enough to walk over to Mlle. de Porhoet. I am toldthat she keeps asking to see me._V.--Two in a Garden_The little maid who came to open the door was weeping and as I came inI was surprised to hear the voice of Laubpin."It is Maxime Marguerite" he said.Had Marguerite also risen up from a bed of sickness to see Mlle. dePorhoet I sprang up the stairs and entered the room."My poor dear boy" said Mlle. de Porhoet in a strange broken voice.She was lying in bed. Laubpin a priest and a doctor were standing onone side and Marguerite and her mother were kneeling down in prayer onthe other. I saw at once that she was at the point of death and kneltdown beside Marguerite. The poor dying woman smiled faintly and gropedfor my hand and put it in Marguerite's and then fell back on thepillow. She was dead.Laubpin led me out of the room and put a document in my hand. It was awill and the ink on it was hardly dry. Mlle. de Porhoet had made me herheir."How good of her" I said to Laubpin. "I shall treasure her testamentas a mark of her love for me. I will settle her little estate on mysister. It will at least keep Hlne from having to go out into theworld as a governess.""And it will keep you my friend from having to go out into the worldas a steward" said Laubpin with a smile. "Don't you remember thatdocument about the Spanish succession which you discovered and sent tome We have won the law-suit and you are the heir to an estate in Spainwhich will make you one of the richest men in France."I went into the garden to think over my strange fortune. How long I satthere in the darkness I do not know. On rising up I heard a faint soundbeneath one of the trees and a beloved form emerged from the foliageand stood against the starry sky."Marguerite" I cried running up to her with outstretched arm.She murmured my name and as I clasped her her lips sought mine and wepoured our souls out in a kiss.                                   I have given Hlne half of my fortune. Marguerite is my wife and Iclose these pages for ever having nothing more to confide to them. Itcan be said of men as it has been said of nations "Happy are those
comment654,that have no story."                                   HENRY FIELDINGAmelia     Henry Fielding was born at Sharpham Park near Glastonbury     England April 12 1707. His father a grandson of the Earl of     Desmond and great-grandson of the first Earl of Denbigh     settled in England shortly after the battle of Ramillies as a     country squire. In due course Fielding was sent to Eton and     afterwards to Leyden where he remained for two years studying     civil law. Financial difficulties however put a temporary     end to his intention of entering the Bar and in 1727 he     solved the problem of a career by beginning to write for the     stage. During the next nine years some eighteen of his plays     were produced. In 1748 he was appointed a justice of peace for     Westminster and his writings on police and crime are of     interest to this day. "Amelia" was published in 1751 when its     author was a magistrate at Bow Street. In a dedicatory letter     Fielding explained that the book was "sincerely designed to     promote the cause of virtue and to expose some of the most     glaring evils as well public as private which at present     infest the country." The licentiousness of wealthy "men about     town" the corruption of justice the abuses of the prison     system the lack of honour concerning marriage--these are some     of the "glaring evils" exposed with all the great novelist's     power in "Amelia." In the characters of Dr. Harrison and     Amelia herself the virtuous man and woman are drawn so     clearly that they inevitably win the reader's sympathy.     "Amelia" does not equal the genius of "Tom Jones" but it is     remarkable for being so largely devoted to the adventures of a     married couple instead of ending at marriage. Fielding died     on October 8 1754._I.--The Inside of a Prison_On the first of April in the year-- the watchmen of a certain parishin Westminster brought several persons whom they had apprehended thepreceding night before Jonathan Thrasher Esq. one of the justices ofthe peace for that city.Among the prisoners a young fellow whose name was Booth was chargedwith beating the watchman in the execution of his office and breakinghis lantern. The justice perceiving the criminal to be but shabbilydressed was going to commit him without asking any further questionsbut at the earnest request of the accused the worthy magistratesubmitted to hear his defence.The young man then alleged that as he was walking home to his lodgingshe saw two men in the street cruelly beating a third upon which he hadstopped and endeavoured to assist the person who was so unequallyattacked that the watch came up during the affray and took them allfour into custody that they were immediately carried to theround-house where the two original assailants found means to make upthe matter and were discharged by the constable a favour which he
comment655,himself having no money in his pocket was unable to obtain. He utterlydenied having assaulted any of the watchmen and solemnly declared thathe was offered his liberty at the price of half a crown.Though the bare word of an offender can never be taken against the oathof his accuser yet the magistrate might have employed some labour incross-examining the watchman or at least have given the defendant timeto send for the other persons who were present at the affray neither ofwhich he did.Booth and the poor man in whose defence he had been engaged were bothdispatched to prison under a guard of watchmen.Mr. Booth was no sooner arrived in the prison than a number of personsgathered around him all demanding garnish. The master or keeper of theprison then acquainted him that it was the custom of the place for everyprisoner upon his first arrival there to give something to the formerprisoners to make them drink. This was what they called garnish. Mr.Booth answered that he would readily comply with this laudable customwere it in his power but that in reality he had not a shilling in hispocket and what was worse he had not a shilling in the world. Uponwhich the keeper departed and left poor Booth to the mercy of hiscompanions who without loss of time stripped him of his coat and hidit.Mr. Booth was too weak to resist and too wise to complain of his usage.He summoned his philosophy to his assistance and resolved to makehimself as easy as possible under his present circumstances.On the following day Miss Matthews an old acquaintance whom he had notseen for some years was brought into the prison and Booth was shortlyafterwards invited to the room this lady had engaged. Miss Matthewshaving told her story requested Booth to do the same and to this heacceded._II.--Captain Booth Tells His Story_"From the first I was in love with Amelia but my own fortune was sodesperate and hers was entirely dependent on her mother a woman ofviolent passions and very unlikely to consent to a match so highlycontrary to the interest of her daughter that I endeavoured to refrainfrom any proposal of love. I had nothing more than the poor provision ofan ensign's commission to depend on and the thought of leaving myAmelia to starve alone deprived of her mother's help was intolerableto me."In spite of this I could not keep from telling Amelia the state of myheart and I soon found all that return of my affection which thetenderest lover can require. Against the opposition of Amelia's motherMrs. Harris to our engagement we had the support of that good man Dr.Harrison the rector and at last Mrs. Harris yielded to the doctor andwe were married. There was an agreement that I should settle all myAmelia's fortune on her except a certain sum which was to be laid outin my advancement in the army and shortly afterwards I was preferred tothe rank of a lieutenant in my regiment and ordered to Gibraltar. Inoticed that Amelia's sister Miss Betty who had said many ill-naturedthings of our marriage now again became my friend."At the siege of Gibraltar I was very badly wounded and in thissituation the image of my Amelia haunted me day and night. Two monthsand more I continued in a state of uncertainty when one afternoon poor
comment656,Atkinson my servant came running to my room. I asked him what was thematter when Amelia herself rushed into the room and ran hastily to me.She gently chided me for concealing my illness from her saying 'OhMr. Booth And do you think so little of your Amelia as to think I couldor would survive you' Amelia then informed me that she had received aletter from an unknown hand acquainting her with my misfortune andadvising her if she desired to see me more to come directly toGibraltar."From the time of Amelia's arrival nothing remarkable happened till myperfect recovery and then the siege being at an end and Amelia beingin some sort of fever the governor gave me leave to attend my wife toMontpelier the air of which was judged to be most likely to restore herto health."A fellow-officer Captain James willingly lent me money and after anample recovery at Montpelier and a stay in Paris we returned toEngland. It was in Paris we received a long letter from Dr. Harrisonenclosing 100 and containing the news that Mrs. Harris was dead andhad left her whole fortune to Miss Betty. So now it was that I was amarried man with children and the half-pay of a lieutenant."Dr. Harrison at whose rectory we were staying came to our assistance.He asked me if I had any prospect of going again into the army if notwhat scheme of life I proposed to myself."I told him that as I had no powerful friends I could have but littleexpectations in a military way that I was incapable of thinking of anyother scheme for I was without the necessary knowledge or experienceand was likewise destitute of money to set up with."The doctor after a little hesitation said he had been thinking onthis subject and proposed to me to turn farmer. At the same time heoffered to let me his parsonage which was then become vacant he saidit was a farm which required but little stock and that little shouldnot be wanting."I embraced this offer very eagerly and Amelia received the news withthe highest transports of joy. Thus you see me degraded from my formerrank in life no longer Captain Booth but Farmer Booth."For a year all went well love health and tranquillity filled ourlives. Then a heavy blow befell us and we were robbed of our dearfriend the doctor who was chosen to attend the young lord the son ofthe patron of the living in his travels as a tutor."By this means I was bereft not only of the best companion in the worldbut of the best counsellor and in consequence of this loss I fell intomany errors."The first of these was in enlarging my business by adding a farm of one
comment657,hundred a year to the parsonage in renting which I had also as bad abargain as the doctor had before given me a good one. The consequence ofwhich was that whereas at the end of the first year I was 80 to thegood at the end of the second I was nearly 40 to the bad."A second folly I was guilty of was in uniting families with the curateof the parish who had just married. We had not however lived onemonth together before I plainly perceived the curate's wife had taken agreat prejudice against my wife though my Amelia had treated her withnothing but kindness and with the mischievous nature of envy spreaddislike against us."My greatest folly however was the purchase of an old coach. Thefarmers and their wives considered that the setting up of a coach wasthe elevating ourselves above them and immediately began to declare waragainst us. The neighbouring little squires too were uneasy to see apoor renter become their equal in a matter in which they placed so muchdignity and began to hate me likewise."My neighbours now began to conspire against me. Whatever I bought Iwas sure to buy dearer and when I sold I was obliged to sell cheaperthan any other. In fact they were all united and while they every daycommitted trespasses on my lands with impunity if any of my cattleescaped into their fields I was either forced to enter into a law-suitor to make amends for the damage sustained."The consequence of all this could be no other than ruin. Before the endof four years I became involved in debt to the extent of 300. Mylandlord seized my stock for rent and to avoid immediate confinementin prison I was forced to leave the country."In this condition I arrived in town a week ago. I had just taken alodging and had written my dear Amelia word where she might find meand that very evening as I was returning from a coffee-house because Iendeavoured to assist the injured party in an affray I was seized bythe watch and committed here by a justice of the peace."_III.--Amelia in London_Miss Matthews being greatly drawn to Captain Booth procured hisdischarge by the expenditure of 20 and obtained her own release at thesame time.Amelia arrived in London to receive her husband in her arms. "For" saidshe "your confinement was known all over the county my sister havingspread the news with a malicious joy and so not hearing from you Ihastened to town with our children."Poor Booth in spite of his release was very cast down. Seeing tears inhis eyes at the sight of his children Amelia embracing him withrapturous fondness cried out "My dear Billy let nothing make youuneasy. Heaven will provide for us and these poor babes. Great fortunesare not necessary to happiness. Make yourself easy my dear love foryou have a wife who will think herself happy with you and endeavour tomake you so in any situation. Fear nothing Billy industry will alwaysprovide us a wholesome meal."Booth who was naturally of a sanguine temper took the cue she hadgiven him but he could not help reproaching himself as the cause of allher wretchedness. This it was that enervated his heart and threw himinto agonies which all that profusion of heroic tenderness that themost excellent of women intended for his comfort served only to heightenand aggravate as the more she rose in his admiration the more shequickened the sense of his unworthiness.His affairs did not prosper in vain he solicited a commission in thearmy. With no great man to back him and with his friend Captain Jamesnow a colonel and in London too taken up with his own affairs toexert any influence on behalf of Booth it seemed as though no escapefrom misery was possible. The beautiful Amelia always patient andcheerful remained his comforter. And Atkinson now a sergeant in theguards was the devoted servant of both Amelia and her husband.
comment658,Then one morning when Amelia was out Booth was arrested for debt andcarried to the bailiff's house in Gray's Inn Lane."Who has done this barbarous action" cries Amelia when the news istold her by Sergeant Atkinson."One I am ashamed to name" cries the sergeant "indeed I had always avery different opinion of him but Dr. Harrison is the man who has donethe deed.""Dr. Harrison" cries Amelia. "Well then there is an end of allgoodness in the world. I will never have a good opinion of any humanbeing more"The fact was that while the doctor was abroad he had received from thecurate and from a gentleman of the neighbourhood accounts of Booth'sdoings very much to his disadvantage. On his return to the parish theseaccusations were confirmed by many witnesses and the wholeneighbourhood rang with several gross and scandalous lies which weremerely the inventions of Booth's enemies. Poisoned with all this malicethe doctor came to London and calling at Booth's lodgings when boththe captain and Amelia were out learnt from the servant-maid that thechildren had got a gold watch and several fine trinkets. These presentsindeed had come from a certain noble lord who hoped by these means towin Amelia's affection but no suspicion of his evil desire had enteredthe innocent mind of Amelia.The doctor had no doubt that these trinkets had been purchased byAmelia and this account tallied so well with the ideas he had imbibedof Booth's extravagance in the country that he firmly believed both thehusband and wife to be the vainest silliest and most unjust peoplealive.But no sooner did the doctor hear that Booth was arrested than thewretched condition of his wife and children began to affect his mind. Inthis temper of mind he resolved to pay Amelia a second visit and was onhis way thither when Sergeant Atkinson met him and made himself knownto him.The doctor received from Atkinson such an account of Booth and hisfamily that he hastened at once to Amelia and soon became satisfiedconcerning the trinkets which had given him so much uneasiness. Amelialikewise gave the doctor some satisfaction as to what he had heard ofher husband's behaviour In the country and assured him upon herhonour that Booth could answer every complaint against his conduct sothat the doctor would find him an innocent unfortunate man the objectof a good man's compassion not of his anger or resentment.This worthy clergyman who was not desirous of finding proofs to condemnthe captain rejoiced heartily in every piece of evidence which tendedto clear up the character of his friend and gave a ready ear to allwhich Amelia said.Induced indeed by the love he always had for that lady whom he waswont to call his daughter as well as by pity for her present conditionthe doctor immediately endeavoured to comfort the afflicted and thenproceeded to accomplish the captain's release."So captain" says the doctor on arrival at the bailiff's house "when
comment659,last we met I believe that we neither of us expected to meet in such aplace as this.""Indeed doctor" cries Booth "I did not expect to have been senthither by the gentleman who did me this favour.""How so sir" said the doctor. "You were sent hither by some person Isuppose to whom you were indebted. But you ought to be more surprisedthat the gentleman who sent you thither is come to release you."_IV.--Fortune Smiles on Amelia_Booth was again arrested some months later and lodged in the bailiff'shouse. This time his creditor was a Captain Trent who had lent himmoney and promised him assistance in getting returned to the army. Inreality Trent was only seeking to ingratiate himself with Amelia andmeeting with no encouragement took his revenge accordingly.Amelia at once sought out Dr. Harrison and told him what had occurredto her husband and the doctor set forwards to the bailiff's to see whathe could do for Booth.The doctor had not got so much money in town as Booth's debt amountedto and therefore he was forced to give bail to the action.While the necessary forms were being made out the bailiff addressinghimself to the doctor said "Sir there is a man above in a dyingcondition that desires the favour of speaking to you. I believe he wantsyou to pray by him."Without making any further inquiry the doctor immediately wentupstairs.The sick man mentioned his name and explained that he lived for manyyears in the town where the doctor resided and that he used to writefor the attorneys in those parts. He was anxious he said as he hopedfor forgiveness to make all the amends he could to some one he hadinjured and to undo if possible the injury he had done.The doctor commended this as a sincere repentance."You know good doctor" the sick man resumed "that Mrs. Harris of ourtown had two daughters--one now Mrs. Booth and another. Before Mrs.Harris died she made a will and left all her fortune except 1000to Mrs. Booth to which will Mr. Murphy the lawyer myself and anotherwere witnesses. Mrs. Harris afterwards died suddenly upon which it wascontrived by her other daughter and Mr. Murphy to make a new will inwhich Mrs. Booth had a legacy of 10 and all the rest was given to theother.""Good heaven how wonderful is thy providence" cries the doctor."Murphy say you Why this Murphy is still my attorney."Within a short time Murphy was arrested and the sick man's depositionstaken. Booth was released on the doctor's bail and on the followingmorning Amelia learnt of the change in fortune that had befallen them.Dr. Harrison himself broke the good news by reading the followingparagraph from the newspaper."Yesterday one Murphy an eminent attorney-at-law was committed toNewgate for the forgery of a will under which an estate has been formany years detained from the right owner.""Now" said the doctor "in this paragraph there is something veryremarkable and that is that it is true. But now let us read thefollowing note upon the words 'right owner.' 'The right owner of thisestate is a young lady of the highest merit whose maiden name wasHarris and who some time since was married to an idle fellow oneLieutenant Booth and the best historians assure us that letters fromthe elder sister of this lady which manifestly prove the forgery andclear up the whole affair are in the hands of an old parson called Dr.Harrison.'""And is this really true" cries Amelia."Yes really and sincerely" cries the doctor "the whole estate--foryour mother left it you all and it is as surely yours as if you werealready in possession.""Gracious heaven" cries she falling on her knees "I thank you" Andthen starting up she ran to her husband and embracing him cried "Mydear love I wish you joy It is upon yours and my children's accountthat I principally rejoice."She then desired her children to be brought to her whom she immediately
comment660,caught in her arms and having profusely cried over them soon regainedher usual temper and complexion.Miss Harris having received a letter from Amelia informing her of thediscovery and the danger in which she stood immediately set out forFrance carrying with her all her money most of her clothes and somefew jewels.About a week afterwards Booth and Amelia with their children andAtkinson and his wife all set forward together for Amelia's housewhere they arrived amidst the acclamations of all the neighbours andevery public demonstration of joy.Miss Harris lived for three years with a broken heart at Boulogne whereshe received annually 50 from her sister and then died in a mostmiserable manner.Dr. Harrison is grown old in years and in honour beloved and respectedby all his parishioners and neighbours.As to Booth and Amelia fortune seems to have made them large amends forthe tricks she played them in their youth. They have continued to enjoyan uninterrupted course of health and happiness. In about six weeksafter Booth's first coming into the country he went to London and paidall his debts after which and a stay of two days only he returnedinto the country and has never since been thirty miles from home.Amelia is still the finest woman in England of her age Booth himselfoften avers she is as handsome as ever. Nothing can equal the serenityof their lives.Amelia declared the other day that she did not remember to have seen herhusband out of humour these ten years                                   Jonathan Wild     "Jonathan Wild" published in 1743 is in many respects     Fielding's most powerful piece of satire surpassed only     perhaps by Thackeray's "Barry Lyndon." It can hardly be     called a novel and still less a serious biography though it     is founded on the real history of a notorious highway robber     and thief. The author disclaimed in his preface any attempt on     his part at authentic history or faithful portraiture.     "Roguery and not a rogue is my subject" he wrote adding     that the ideas of goodness and greatness are too often     confounded together. "A man may be great without being good
comment661,     or good without being great." The story of "Jonathan Wild" is     really a bitter satirical attack on what Fielding called "the     greatness which is totally devoid of goodness." He avowed it     his intention "to expose the character of this bombast     greatness" and no one can deny the success of his     achievement. Surely no story was ever written under more     desperate circumstances. The evils of poverty which at this     period were at their height were aggravated by the serious     illness of his wife and his own sufferings from attacks of     gout. These troubles and others may well increase our     admiration for the genius which in the face of all     difficulties is shown in "Jonathan Wild."_I.--Mr. Wild's Early Exploits_Mr. Jonathan Wild who was descended from a long line of great men wasborn in 1665. His father followed the fortunes of Mr. Snap who enjoyeda reputable office under the sheriff of London and Middlesex and hismother was the daughter of Scragg Hollow Esq. of Hockley-in-the-Hole.He was scarce settled at school before he gave marks of his lofty andaspiring temper and was regarded by his schoolfellows with thatdeference which men generally pay to those superior geniuses who willexact it of them. If an orchard was to be robbed Wild was consultedand though he was himself seldom concerned in the execution of thedesign yet was he always concerter of it and treasurer of the bootysome little part of which he would now and then with wonderfulgenerosity bestow on those who took it. He was generally very secret onthese occasions but if any offered to plunder of his own head withoutacquainting Master Wild and making a deposit of the booty he was sureto have an information against him lodged with the schoolmaster and tobe severely punished for his pains.At the age of seventeen his father brought the young gentleman to townwhere he resided with him till he was of an age to travel.Men of great genius as easily discover one another as Freemasons can. Itwas therefore no wonder that the Count la Ruse--who was confined in Mr.Snap's house until the day when he should appear in court to answer acertain creditor--soon conceived an inclination to an intimacy with ouryoung hero whose vast abilities could not be concealed from one of thecount's discernment for though the latter was exceedingly expert at hiscards he was no match for Master Wild who never failed to send himaway from the table with less in his pocket than he brought to it. Withso much ingenuity indeed could our young hero extract a purse thathis hands made frequent visits to the count's pocket before the latterhad entertained any suspicion of him. But one night when Wild imaginedthe count asleep he made so unguarded an attack upon him that the othercaught him in the act. However he did not think proper to acquaint himwith the discovery he had made but only took care for the future tobutton his pockets and to pack the cards with double industry.In reality this detection recommended these two prigs to each otherfor a wise man--that is to say a rogue--considers a trick in life as agamester doth a trick at play. It sets him on his guard but he admiresthe dexterity of him who plays it.When our two friends met the next morning the count began to bewail themisfortune of his captivity and the backwardness of friends to assisteach other in their necessities.Wild told him that bribery was the surest means of procuring his escape
comment662,and advised him to apply to the maid telling him at the same time thatas he had no money he must make it up with promises which he would knowhow to put off.The maid only consented to leave the door open when Wild depositing aguinea in the girl's hands declared that he himself would swear that hesaw the count descending from the window by a pair of sheets.Thus did our young hero not only lend his rhetoric which few peoplecare to do without a fee but his money too to procure liberty for hisfriend. At the same time it would be highly derogatory from the greatcharacter of Wild should the reader not understand that this was donebecause our hero had some interested view in the count's enlargement.Intimacy and friendship subsisted between the count and Mr. Wild andthe latter now dressed in good clothes was introduced into the bestcompany. They constantly frequented the assemblies auctions gaming-tables and play-houses and Wild passed for a gentleman of greatfortune.It was then that an accident occurred that obliged Wild to go abroad forseven years to his majesty's plantations in America and there are suchvarious accounts one of which only can be true of this accident thatwe shall pass them all over. It is enough that Wild went abroad andstayed seven years._II.--An Example of Wild's Greatness_The count was one night very successful at the gaming-table where Wildwho was just returned from his travels was then present as waslikewise a young gentleman whose name was Bob Bagshot an acquaintanceof Mr. Wild's. Taking therefore Mr. Bagshot aside he advised him toprovide himself with a case of pistols and to attack the count on hisway home.This was accordingly executed and the count obliged to surrender tosavage force what he had in so genteel a manner taken at play. As onemisfortune never comes alone the count had hardly passed theexamination of Mr. Bagshot when he fell into the hands of Mr. Snap whocarried him to his house.Mr. Wild and Mr. Bagshot went together to the tavern where Mr. Bagshotoffered to share the booty. Having divided the money into two unequalheaps and added a golden snuffbox to the lesser heap he desired Mr.Wild to take his choice.Mr. Wild immediately conveyed the larger share of the ready into hispocket according to an excellent maxim of his--"First secure what shareyou can before you wrangle for the rest" and then turning to hiscompanion he asked him whether he intended to keep all that sumhimself. "I grant you took it" Wild said "but pray who proposed or
comment663,counselled the taking of it Can you say that you have done more thanexecute my scheme The ploughman the shepherd the weaver the builderand the soldier work not for themselves but others they are contentedwith a poor pittance--the labourer's hire--and permit us the great toenjoy the fruits of their labours. Why then should the state of a prigdiffer from all others Or why should you who are the labourer onlythe executor of my scheme expect a share in the profit Be advisedtherefore deliver the whole booty to me and trust to my bounty foryour reward."Mr. Bagshot not being minded to yield to these arguments Wild adopted afiercer tone and the other was glad to let him borrow a part of hisshare. So that Wild got three-fourths of the whole before taking leaveof his companion.Wild then returned to visit his friend the count now in captivity atMr. Snap's for our hero was none of those half-bred fellows who areashamed to see their friends when they have plundered and betrayed them.The count little suspecting that Wild had been the sole contriver ofthe misfortune which had befallen him eagerly embraced him and Wildreturned his embrace with equal warmth.While they were discoursing Mr. Snap introduced Mr. Bagshot for Mr.Bagshot had lost what money he had from Mr. Wild at a gaming-table andwas directly afterwards arrested for debt. Mr. Wild no sooner saw hisfriend than he immediately presented him to the count who received himwith great civility. But no sooner was Mr. Bagshot out of the room thanthe count said to Wild "I am very well convinced that Bagshot is theperson who robbed me and I will apply to a justice of the peace."Wild replied with indignation that Mr. Bagshot was a man of honour butas this had no weight with the count he went on more vehemently "I amashamed of my own discernment when I mistook you for a great man.Prosecute him and you may promise yourself to be blown up at everygaming-house in the town. But leave the affair to me and if I find hehath played you this trick I will engage my own honour you shall in theend be no loser." The count answered "If I was sure to be no loser Mr.Wild I apprehend you have a better opinion of my understanding than toimagine I would prosecute a gentleman for the sake of the public."Wild having determined to make use of Bagshot as long as he could andthen send him to be hanged went to Bagshot next day and told him thecount knew all and intended to prosecute him and the only thing to bedone was to refund the money."Refund the money" cried Bagshot. "Why you know what small part of itfell to my share""How" replied Wild. "Is this your gratitude to me for saving your lifeFor your own conscience must convince you of your guilt.""Marry come up" quoth Bagshot. "I believe my life alone will not be indanger. Can you deny your share""Yes you rascal" answered Wild. "I do deny everything and do you finda witness to prove it. I will show you the difference between committinga robbery and conniving at it."So alarmed was Bagshot at the threats of Wild that he drew forth all hefound in his pockets to the amount of twenty-one guineas which he hadjust gained at dice.Wild now returned to the count and informed him that he had got tenguineas of Bagshot and by these means the count was once more enlargedand enabled to carry out a new plan of the great Wild._III.--Mr. Heartfree's Weakness_By accident Wild had met with a young fellow who had formerly been hiscompanion at school.Mr. Thomas Heartfree for that was his name was of an honest and opendisposition. He was possessed of several great weaknesses of mind beinggood-natured friendly and generous to a great excess.This young man who was about Wild's age had some time before set up inthe trade of a jeweller in the materials for which he had laid out the
comment664,greatest part of a little fortune.He no sooner recognised Wild than he accosted him in the most friendlymanner and invited him home with him to breakfast which invitation ourhero with no great difficulty consented to.Wild after vehement professions of friendship then told him he had anopportunity of recommending a gentleman on the brink of marriage tohis custom "and" says he "I will endeavour to prevail on him tofurnish his lady with jewels at your shop."Having parted from Heartfree Wild sought out the count who in orderto procure credit from tradesmen had taken a handsome houseready-furnished in one of the new streets. He instructed the count totake only one of Heartfree's jewels at the first interview to rejectthe rest as not fine enough and order him to provide some richer. Thecount was then to dispose of the jewel and by means of that money andhis great abilities at cards and dice to get together as large a sum aspossible which he was to pay down to Heartfree at the delivery of theset of jewels.This method was immediately put in execution and the count the firstday took only a single brilliant worth about 300 and ordered anecklace and earrings of the value of 3000 more to be prepared bythat day week.This interval was employed by Wild in raising a gang and within a fewdays he had levied several bold and resolute fellows fit for anyenterprise how dangerous or great soever.The count disposed of his jewel for its full value and by his dexterityraised 1000. This sum he paid down to Heartfree at the end of theweek and promised him the rest within a month. Heartfree did not in theleast scruple giving him credit but as he had in reality procured thosejewels of another his own little stock not being able to furnishanything so valuable. The count in addition to the 1000 in gold gavehim his note for 2800 more.As soon as Heartfree was departed Wild came in and received the casketfrom the count and an appointment was made to meet the next morning tocome to a division of its contents.Two gentlemen of resolution in the meantime attacked Heartfree on hisway home according to Wild's orders and spoiled the enemy of the wholesum he had received from the count. According to agreement Wild whohad made haste to overtake the conquerors took nine-tenths of thebooty but was himself robbed of this 900 before nightfall.As for the casket when he opened it the stones were but paste. For thesagacious count had conveyed the jewels into his own pocket and intheir stead had placed artificial stones. On Wild's departure the counthastened out of London and was well on his way to Dover when Wildknocked at his door.Heartfree wounded and robbed had only the count's note left and thiswas returned to him as worthless inquiries having proved that the counthad run away. So confused was poor Heartfree at this that his creditorfor the jewels was frightened and at once had him arrested for thedebt.Heartfree applied in vain for money to numerous customers who wereindebted to him they all replied with various excuses and the unhappywretch was soon taken to Newgate. He had been inclined to blame Wild forhis misfortunes but our hero boldly attacked him for giving credit tothe count and this degree of impudence convinced both Heartfree and hiswife of Wild's innocence the more so as the latter promised to procurebail for his friend. In this he was unsuccessful and it was long beforeHeartfree was released and restored to happiness._IV.--The Highest Pinnacle of Greatness_Wild was a living instance that human greatness and happiness are notalways inseparable. He was under a continual alarm of frights and fearsand jealousies and was thoroughly convinced there was not a single manamongst his own gang who would not for the value of five shillingsbring him to the gallows.
comment665,A clause in an act of parliament procured by a learned judge entrappedWild. Hitherto he had always employed less gifted men to carry out hisplans. Now by this law it was made capital in a prig to steal with thehands of other people and it was impossible for our hero to avoid thedestruction so plainly calculated for his greatness.Wild having received from some dutiful members of his gang a valuablepiece of goods did for a consideration re-convey it to the rightowner for which fact being ungratefully informed against by the saidowner he was surprised in his own house and being overpowered bynumbers was hurried before a magistrate and by him committed toNewgate.When the day of his trial arrived our hero was notwithstanding hisutmost caution and prudence convicted and sentenced to be hanged by theneck. He now suspected that the malice of his enemies would overpowerhim and therefore betook himself to that true support of greatness inaffliction--a bottle by means of which he was enabled to curse swearand bully and brave his fate. Other comfort indeed he had not muchfor not a single friend ever came near him.From the time our hero gave over all hopes of life his conduct wastruly great and admirable. Instead of showing any marks of contrition ordejection he rather infused more confidence and assurance into hislooks. He spent most of his hours in drinking with acquaintances andwith the good chaplain and being asked whether he was afraid to die heanswered "It's only a dance without music. A man can die but once.Zounds Who's afraid"At length the morning came which Fortune had resolutely ordained for theconsummation of our hero's greatness he had himself indeed modestlydeclined the public honour she intended him and had taken a quantity oflaudanum in order to retire quietly off the stage. But it is vain tostruggle against the decrees of fortune and the laudanum provedinsufficient to stop his breath.At the usual hour he was acquainted that the cart was ready and hisfetters having been knocked off in a solemn and ceremonious mannerafter drinking a bumper of brandy he ascended the cart where he was nosooner seated than he received the acclamations of the multitude whowere highly ravished with his greatness.The cart now moved slowly on preceded by a troop of Horse Guardsbearing javelins in their hands through the streets lined with crowdsall admiring the great behaviour of our hero who rode on sometimessighing sometimes swearing sometimes singing or whistling as hishumour varied.When he came to the tree of glory he was welcomed with an universalshout of the people but there were not wanting some who maligned this
comment666,completion of glory now about to be fulfilled by our hero andendeavoured to prevent it by knocking him on the head as he stood underthe tree while the chaplain was performing his last office.They therefore began to batter the cart with stones brick-bats dirtand all manner of mischievous weapons so that the ecclesiastic endedalmost in an instant and conveyed himself into a place of safety in ahackney coach.One circumstance must not be omitted. Whilst the chaplain was busy inhis ejaculations Wild in the midst of the shower of stones etc.which played upon him true to his character applied his hands to theparson's pocket and emptied it of his bottle-screw which he carriedout of the world in his hand.The chaplain being now descended from the cart Wild had justopportunity to cast his eyes around the crowd and to give them a heartycurse when immediately the horses moved on and with universalapplause our hero swung out of this world.                                   Joseph Andrews     "Joseph Andrews" Fielding's first novel was published in     1742 and was intended to be a satire on Richardson's "Pamela"     see Vol. VII which appeared in 1740. He described it as     "written in the manner of Cervantes" and in Parson Adams     there is the same quaint blending of the humorous and the     pathetic as in the Knight of La Mancha. Although such     characters as Lady Booby and Mrs. Slipslop are admittedly     ridiculous Parson Adams remains an admirable study of a     simple-minded clergyman of the eighteenth century._I.--The Virtues of Joseph Andrews_Mr. Joseph Andrews was esteemed to be the only son of Gaffer and GammerAndrews and brother to the illustrious Pamela.At ten years old by which time his education was advanced to writingand reading he was bound an apprentice to Sir Thomas Booby an uncle ofMr. Booby's by the father's side. From the stable of Sir Thomas he waspreferred to attend as foot-boy on Lady Booby to go on her errandsstand behind her chair wait at her tea-table and carry her prayer-bookto church at which place he behaved so well in every respect at divineservice that it recommended him to the notice of Mr. Abraham Adams thecurate who took an opportunity one day to ask the young man severalquestions concerning religion with his answers to which he waswonderfully pleased.Mr. Abraham Adams was an excellent scholar a man of good sense and goodnature but at the same time entirely ignorant of the ways of the world.At the age of fifty he was provided with a handsome income of twenty-three pounds a year which however he could not make any great figurewith because he was a little encumbered with a wife and six children.Adams had no nearer access to Sir Thomas or my lady than through Mrs.Slipslop the waiting-gentlewoman for Sir Thomas was too apt toestimate men merely by their dress or fortune and my lady was a womanof gaiety who never spoke of any of her country neighbours by any otherappellation than that of the brutes.Mrs. Slipslop being herself the daughter of a curate preserved somerespect for Adams she would frequently dispute with him and was amighty affecter of hard words which she used in such a manner that the
comment667,parson was frequently at some loss to guess her meaning.Adams was so much impressed by the industry and application he saw inyoung Andrews that one day he mentioned the case to Mrs. Slipslopdesiring her to recommend him to my lady as a youth very susceptible oflearning and one whose instruction in Latin he would himself undertakeby which means he might be qualified for a higher station than that offootman. He therefore desired that the boy might be left behind underhis care when Sir Thomas and my lady went to London."La Mr. Adams" said Mrs. Slipslop "do you think my lady will sufferany preambles about any such matter She is going to London veryconcisely and I am confidous would not leave Joey behind on anyaccount for he is one of the genteelest young fellows you may see in asummer's day and I am confidous she would as soon think of parting witha pair of her grey mares for she values herself on one as much as theother. And why is Latin more necessitous for a footman than a gentlemanI am confidous my lady would be angry with me for mentioning it and Ishall draw myself into no such delemy."So young Andrews went to London in attendance on Lady Booby and becameacquainted with the brethren of his profession. They could not howeverteach him to game swear drink nor any other genteel vice the townabounded with. He applied most of his leisure hours to music in whichhe greatly improved himself so that he led the opinion of all the otherfootmen at an opera. Though his morals remain entirely uncorrupted hewas at the same time smarter and genteeler than any of the beaus in towneither in or out of livery.At this time an accident happened and this was no other than the deathof Sir Thomas Booby who left his disconsolate lady closely confined toher house. During the first six days the poor lady admitted none butMrs. Slipslop and three female friends who made a party at cards buton the seventh she ordered Joey whom we shall hereafter call Joseph tobring up her teakettle.Lady Booby's affection for her footman had for some time been a matterof gossip in the town but it is certain that her innocent freedoms hadmade no impression on young Andrews.Now however he thought my lady had become distracted with grief at herhusband's death so strange was her conduct and wrote to his sisterPamela on the subject.     If madam be mad I shall not care for staying long in the     family so I heartily wish you could get me a place at some     neighbouring gentleman's. I fancy I shall be discharged very     soon and the moment I am I shall return to my old master's     country seat if it be only to see Parson Adams who is the     best man in the world. London is a bad place and there is so     little good fellowship that the next-door neighbours don't     know one another. Your loving brother     JOSEPH ANDREWS.The sending of this letter was quickly followed by the discharge of thewriter. To Lady Booby's open declarations of love Joseph replied that alady having no virtue was not a reason against his having any."I am out of patience" cries the lady "did ever mortal hear of a man'svirtue Will magistrates who punish lewdness or parsons who preachagainst it make any scruple of committing it And can a boy have theconfidence to talk of his virtue""Madam" says Joseph "that boy is the brother of Pamela and would beashamed that the chastity of his family which is preserved in hershould be stained in him. If there are such men as your ladyshipmentions I am sorry for it and I wish they had an opportunity of
comment668,reading my sister Pamela's letters nor do I doubt but such an examplewould amend them.""You impudent villain" cries the lady in a rage. "Get out of my sightand leave the house this night"Joseph having received what wages were due and having been stripped ofhis livery took a melancholy leave of his fellow-servants and set outat seven in the evening._II.--Adventures on the Road_It may be wondered why Joseph made such extraordinary haste to get outof London and why instead of proceeding to the habitation of hisfather and mother or to his beloved sister Pamela he chose rather toset out full speed to Lady Booby's country seat which he had left onhis journey to town.Be it known then that in the same parish where this seat stood therelived a young girl whom Joseph longed more impatiently to see than hisparents or his sister. She was a poor girl formerly bred up in SirThomas's house and discarded by Mrs. Slipslop on account of herextraordinary beauty was now a servant to a farmer in the parish.Fanny was two years younger than our hero and had been always belovedby him and returned his affection. They had been acquainted from theirinfancy and Mr. Adams had with much ado prevented them from marryingand persuaded them to wait till a few years' service and thrift had alittle improved their experience and enabled them to live comfortablytogether.They followed this good man's advice as indeed his word was littleless than a law in his parish for during twenty-five years he had shownthat he had the good of his parishioners entirely at heart so that theyconsulted him on every occasion and very seldom acted contrary to hisopinion.Honest Joseph therefore set out on his travels without delay in orderthat he might once more look upon his Fanny from whom he had beenabsent for twelve months.But on the road he was attacked by robbers and having been leftwounded in a ditch was mercifully taken to an inn by some latertravellers.It was at this same inn that to the great surprise on both sides Mr.Abraham Adams found Joseph.The parson informed his young friend who was still sick in bed thatthe occasion of the journey he was making to London was to publish threevolumes of sermons being encouraged as he said by an advertisementlately set forth by the Society of Booksellers but though he imaginedhe should get a considerable sum of money on this occasion which hisfamily were in urgent need of he protested he would not leave Joseph inhis present penniless condition. Finally he told him he had nineshillings and threepence-halfpenny in his pocket which he was welcometo use as he pleased.This goodness of Parson Adams brought tears into Joseph's eyes he hadnow a second reason to desire life that he might show his gratitude tosuch a friend.Before pursuing his journey Adams made the acquaintance of another
comment669,clergyman named Barnabas at the inn who in his turn hearing that Adamswas proposing to publish sermons introduced him to a stranger who hesaid was a bookseller.Adams saluting the stranger answered Barnabas that he was very muchobliged to him that nothing could be more convenient for he had noother business to the great city and was heartily desirous of returningwith the young man who was just recovered of his misfortune. To inducethe bookseller to be as expeditious as possible he assured them theirmeeting was extremely lucky to himself for that he had the mostpressing occasion for money at that time his own being almost spent."So that nothing" says he "could be so opportune as my making animmediate bargain with you.""Sir sermons are mere drugs" said the stranger. "The trade is sovastly stocked with them that really unless they come out with the nameof Whitefield or Wesley or some other such great man as a bishop orthose sort of people I don't care to touch. However I will if youplease take the manuscript with me to town and send you my opinion ofit in a very short time."When however Adams began to describe the nature of his sermons thebookseller drew back on the ground that the clergy would be certain tocry down such a book.An accident prevented Mr. Adams from pursuing a market for his sermonsany further which he would have done in spite of the advice of Barnabasand the bookseller. This accident was that those sermons which theparson was travelling to London to publish were left behind what he hadmistaken for them in the saddle-bags were three shirts which Mrs.Adams who thought her husband would need shirts rather than sermons onhis journey had carefully provided for him.Joseph concerned at the disappointment to his friend begged him topursue his journey all the same and promised he would himself returnwith the books to him with the utmost expedition."No thank you child" answered Adams "it shall not be so. What wouldit avail me to tarry in the great city unless I had my discourses withme No as this accident has happened I am resolved to return back tomy cure together with you which indeed my inclination sufficientlyleads me to."Mr. Adams whose credit was good wherever he was known having borroweda guinea from a servant belonging to a coach-and-six who had beenformerly one of his parishioners discharged the bill for Joseph andhimself and the two travellers set off._III.--More Adventures_Adams and Joseph Andrews being for a time separated on the road throughthe former's absent-mindedness it fell to the lot of the parson tohasten to the assistance of a damsel who in a lonely place was beingattacked by some ruffian.Adams was as strong as he was brave and having rescued the maiden tookher under his protection. It was too dark for either to identify theother but on Mr. Adams ejaculating the name of Joseph Andrews forwhose safety he was anxious his companion recognised his voice and theparson was quickly informed that it was Fanny who was by his side.The fact was the poor girl had heard of Joseph's misfortune from theservants of a coach which had stopped at the inn while the poor youthwas confined to his bed and she had that instant abandoned the cow shewas milking and taking with her a little bundle of clothes under her
comment670,arm and all the money she was worth in her own purse immediately setforward in pursuit of one whom she loved with inexpressible violencethough with the purest and most delicate passion.Fanny was now in the nineteenth year of her age she was tall anddelicately shaped. Her hair was a chestnut brown her complexion wasfair and to conclude all she had a natural gentility which surprisedall who beheld her.Can it be wondered that on the following day when Adams and the damselovertook Andrews at a wayside ale-house the youth imprinted numberlesskisses on her lips while Parson Adams danced about the room in arapture of joyIt was so late when our travellers left the ale-house that they had nottravelled many miles before night overtook them. They moved forwardswhere the nearest light presented itself and having crossed a commonfield they came to a meadow where they seemed to be at a very littledistance from the light when to their grief they arrived at the banksof a river. Adams declared he could swim but Joseph answered if theywalked along its banks they might be certain of soon finding a bridgeespecially as by the number of lights they might be assured a parishwas near."That's true indeed" said Adams. "I did not think of that."Accordingly Joseph's advice being taken they passed over two meadowsand came to a little orchard which led them to a house. Fanny begged ofJoseph to knock at the door assuring him she was so weary that shecould hardly stand on her feet and the door being immediately opened aplain kind of man appeared at it. Adams acquainted him that they had ayoung woman with them who was so tired with her journey that he shouldbe much obliged to him if he would suffer her to come in and restherself.The man who saw Fanny by the light of the candle which he held in hishand perceiving her innocent and modest look and having noapprehensions from the civil behaviour of Adams presently answered thatthe young woman was very welcome to rest herself in his house and sowere her company. He then ushered them into a very decent room wherehis wife was sitting at a table she immediately rose up and assistedthem in setting forth chairs and desired them to sit down.They now sat cheerfully round the fire till the master of the househaving surveyed his guests and conceiving that the cassock whichappeared under Adams's greatcoat and the shabby livery of JosephAndrews did not well suit the familiarity between them began toentertain some suspicions not much to their advantage. Addressinghimself therefore to Adams he said he perceived he was a clergyman byhis dress and supposed that honest man was his footman."Sir" answered Adams "I am a clergyman at your service but as tothat young man whom you have rightly termed honest he is at present innobody's service he never lived in any other family than that of LadyBooby from whence he was discharged I assure you for no crime."The modest behaviour of Joseph with the character which Adams gave ofhim entirely cured a jealousy which had lately been in the gentleman'smind that Fanny was the daughter of some person of fashion and thatJoseph had run away with her and Adams was concerned in the plot.Having had a full account from Adams of Joseph's history he becameenamoured of his guests drank their healths with great cheerfulnessand at the parson's request told something of his own life."Sir" says Adams at the conclusion of the history "fortune has Ithink paid you all her debts in this sweet retirement.""Sir" replied the gentleman whose name was Wilson "I have the best ofwives and three pretty children but within three years of my arrivalhere I lost my eldest son. If he had died I could have borne the losswith patience but alas he was stolen away from my door by some wickedtravelling people whom they call gypsies nor could I ever with themost diligent search recover him. Poor child he had the sweetest lookThe exact picture of his mother" Mr. Wilson went on to say that heshould know his son amongst ten thousand for he had a mark on hisbreast of a strawberry.
comment671,_IV.--Joseph Finds his Father_Our travellers having well refreshed themselves at Mr. Wilson's houserenewed their journey next morning with great alacrity and two dayslater reached the parish they were seeking.The people flocked about Parson Adams like children round a parent andthe parson on his side shook every one by the hand. Nor did Joseph andFanny want a hearty welcome from all who saw them. Adams carried hisfellow-travellers home to his house where he insisted on theirpartaking whatever his wife could provide and on the very next Sundayhe published for the first time the banns of marriage between JosephAndrews and Fanny Goodwill.Lady Booby who was now at her country seat again was furious when sheheard in church these banns called and at once sent for Mr. Adams andrated him soundly."It is my orders that you publish these banns no more and if you dareI will recommend it to your master the rector to discard you from hisservice" says my lady. "The fellow Andrews is a vagabond and shall notsettle here and bring a nest of beggars into the parish.""Madam" answered Adams "I know not what your ladyship means by theterms 'master' and 'service.' I am in the service of a Master who willnever discard me for doing my duty and if the rector thinks proper toturn me from my cure God will provide me I hope another."The malice of Lady Booby did not stop at this she endeavoured to getJoseph and Fanny convicted on a trumped-up charge of trespass. In thisbase wickedness she was defeated by her nephew young Squire Booby whohad married the virtuous Pamela Joseph's sister and at once stoppedthe proceedings. More than that he carried off Andrews to Lady Booby'sand on his arrival said "Madam as I have married a virtuous andworthy woman I am resolved to own her relations and show them allrespect I shall think myself therefore infinitely obliged to all minewho will do the same. It is true her brother has been your servant buthe has now become my brother."Lady Booby answered that she would be pleased to entertain JosephAndrews but when the squire went on to speak of Fanny his aunt put herfoot down resolutely against her civility to the young woman.And now both Pamela and her husband were inclined to urge Joseph tobreak off the engagement with Fanny but the young man would not giveway and in this he was supported by Mr. Adams.The arrival of a peddler in the parish who had shown some civility toAdams and Andrews when they were travelling on the road threatened themarriage prospect much more dangerously for a time.According to the pedaler who was a man of some education and birthFanny had been stolen away from her home when an infant and sold forthree guineas to Sir Thomas Booby the name of her family was Andrewsand they had a daughter of a very strange name Pamela. This story hehad received from a dying woman when he had been a drummer in an Irishregiment.The only thing now to be done was to send for old Mr. Andrews and hiswife and in the meantime the pedal was bidden to Booby Hall to tellthe whole story again. All who heard him were well satisfied of thetruth except Pamela who imagined as neither of her parents had evermentioned such an incident to her it must be false and except LadyBooby who suspected the falsehood of the story from her ardent desirethat it should be true and Joseph who feared its truth from hisearnest wishes that it might prove false.On the following morning news came of the arrival of old Mr. Andrews andhis wife. Mr. Andrews assured Mr. Booby that he had never lost a
comment672,daughter by gypsies nor ever had any other children than Joseph andPamela. But old Mrs. Andrews running to Fanny embraced her cryingout "She is--she is my child"The company were all amazed at this disagreement until the old womanexplained the mystery. During her husband's absence at Gibraltar whenhe was a sergeant in the army a party of gypsies had stolen the littlegirl who had been born to him and left a small male child in her place.So she had brought up the boy as her own."Well" says Gaffer Andrews "you have proved I think very plainlythat this girl does not belong to us I hope you are certain the boy isours."Then it turned out that Joseph had a strawberry mark on his left breastand this made the peddler who knew all about Mr. Wilson's losssatisfied that Joseph was no other than Mr. Wilson's son.So Mr. Wilson had to be sent for who on his arrival no sooner saw themark than he cried out with tears of joy "I have discovered my son"The banns having been duly called there was now nothing to prevent thewedding which having taken place Joseph and his wife settled down inMr. Wilson's parish Mr. Booby having given Fanny a fortune of 2000.He also presented Mr. Adams with a living of 130 a year.                                   Tom Jones     "The History of Tom Jones a Foundling" described in the     dedication as the "labour of some years of my life" appeared     in six volumes on February 28 1749 a short time after     Fielding's appointment as justice of peace for Westminster.     Though its broad humour and coarseness of expression are     perhaps hard to bear in these times it is by common consent     Fielding's masterpiece and by way of being one of the     greatest novels in the language. For experience of life     observation of character and sheer humanity it is certainly     an outstanding specimen of the English novel and manners. Like     others of his books "Tom Jones" was written during a period     of great mental strain. Ever haunted by poverty Fielding     acknowledges his debt to his old schoolfellow Lyttelton to     whom he owed his "existence during the composition of the     book." The story was popular from the first._I.--Mr. Allworthy Makes a Discovery_In that part of the country which is commonly called Somersetshire therelately lived a gentleman whose name was Allworthy and who might well becalled the favourite of both nature and fortune. From the former ofthese he derived an agreeable person a sound constitution a solid
comment673,understanding and a benevolent heart by the latter he was decreed tothe inheritance of one of the largest estates in the country.Mr. Allworthy lived for the most part retired in the country with onesister for whom he had a very tender affection. This lady Miss BridgetAllworthy now somewhat past the age of thirty was of that species ofwomen whom you commend rather for good qualities than beauty.Mr. Allworthy had been absent a full quarter of a year in London on somevery particular business and having returned to his house very late inthe evening retired much fatigued to his chamber. Here after he hadspent some minutes on his knees--a custom which he never broke throughon any account--he was preparing to step into bed when upon openingthe clothes to his great surprise he beheld an infant wrapped up insome coarse linen in a sweet and profound sleep between his sheets. Hestood for some time lost in astonishment at this sight but soon beganto be touched with sentiments of compassion for the little wretch beforehim. He then rang his bell and ordered an elderly woman-servant to riseimmediately and come to him.The consternation of Mrs. Deborah Wilkins at the finding of the littleinfant was rather greater than her master's had been nor could sherefrain from crying out with great horror "My good sir what's to bedone"Mr. Allworthy answered she must take care of the child that evening andin the morning he would give orders to provide it a nurse."Yes sir" says she "and I hope your worship will send out yourwarrant to take up the hussy its mother. Indeed such wicked slutscannot be too severely punished for laying their sins at honest men'sdoors and though your worship knows your own innocence yet the worldis censorious and if your worship should provide for the child it maymake the people after to believe. If I might be so bold as to give myadvice I would have it put in a basket and sent out and laid at thechurchwarden's door. It is a good night only a little rainy and windyand if it was well wrapped up and put in a warm basket it is two to onebut it lives till it is found in the morning. But if it should not wehave discharged our duty in taking care of it and it is perhapsbetter for such creatures to die in a state of innocence than to grow upand imitate their mothers."But Mr. Allworthy had now got one of his fingers into the infant's handwhich by its gentle pressure seeming to implore his assistancecertainly outpleaded the eloquence of Mrs. Deborah. Mr. Allworthy gavepositive orders for the child to be taken away and provided with pap andother things against it waked. He likewise ordered that proper clothesshould be procured for it early in the morning and that it should bebrought to himself as soon as he was stirring.Such was the respect Mrs. Wilkins bore her master under whom sheenjoyed a most excellent place that her scruples gave way to hisperemptory commands and declaring the child was a sweet little infantshe walked off with it to her own chamber.Allworthy betook himself to those pleasing slumbers which a heart thathungers after goodness is apt to enjoy when thoroughly satisfied.In the morning Mr. Allworthy told his sister he had a present for herand when Mrs. Wilkins produced the little infant told her the wholestory of its appearance.Miss Bridget took the good-natured side of the question intimated somecompassion for the helpless little creature and commended her brother'scharity in what he had done. The good lady subsequently gave orders forproviding all necessaries for the child and her orders were indeed soliberal that had it been a child of her own she could not have exceededthem._II.--The Foundling Achieves Manhood_Miss Bridget having been asked in marriage by one Captain Blifil ahalf-pay officer and the nuptials duly celebrated Mrs. Blifil was in
comment674,course of time delivered of a fine boy.Though the birth of an heir to his beloved sister was a circumstance ofgreat joy to Mr. Allworthy yet it did not alienate his affections fromthe little foundling to whom he had been godfather and had given hisown name of Thomas the surname of Jones being added because it wasbelieved that was the mother's name.He told his sister if she pleased the newborn infant should be bred uptogether with little Tommy to which she consented for she had truly agreat complaisance for her brother.The captain however could not so easily bring himself to bear what hecondemned as a fault in Mr. Allworthy for his meditations being chieflyemployed on Mr. Allworthy's fortune and on his hopes of succession helooked on all the instances of his brother-in-law's generosity asdiminutions of his own wealth.But one day while the captain was exulting in the happiness which wouldaccrue to him by Mr. Allworthy's death he himself died of apoplexy.So the two boys grew up together under the care of Mr. Allworthy andMrs. Blifil and by the time he was fourteen Tom Jones--who accordingto universal opinion was certainly born to be hanged--had been alreadyconvicted of three robberies--_viz._ of robbing an orchard of stealinga duck out of a farmer's yard and of picking Master Blifil's pocket ofa ball.The vices of this young man were moreover heightened by thedisadvantageous light in which they appeared when opposed to the virtuesof Master Blifil his companion. He was indeed a lad of remarkabledisposition--sober discreet and pious beyond his age and manyexpressed their wonder that Mr. Allworthy should suffer such a lad asTom Jones to be educated with his nephew lest the morals of the lattershould be corrupted by his example.To say the truth the whole duck and great part of the apples wereconverted to the use of Tom's friend the gamekeeper and his familythough as Jones alone was discovered the poor lad bore not only thewhole smart but the whole blame.Mr. Allworthy had committed the instruction of the two boys to a learneddivine the Reverend Mr. Thwackum who resided in the house but thoughMr. Allworthy had given him frequent orders to make no differencebetween the lads yet was Thwackum altogether as kind and gentle to
comment675,Master Blifil as he was harsh nay even barbarous to the other. Intruth Blifil had greatly gained his master's affections partly by theprofound respect he always showed his person but much more by thedecent reverence with which he received his doctrine for he had got byheart and frequently repeated his phrases and maintained all hismaster's religious principles with a zeal which was surprising in oneso young.Tom Jones on the other hand was not only deficient in outward tokensof respect often forgetting to pull off his cap at his master'sapproach but was altogether unmindful both of his master's precepts andexample.At the age of twenty however Tom for his love of hunting had becomea great favourite with Mr. Allworthy's neighbour Squire Western andSophia Mr. Western's only child lost her heart irretrievably to himbefore she suspected it was in danger. On his side Tom was trulysensible of the great worth of Sophia. He liked her person extremely noless admired her accomplishments and tenderly loved her goodness. Inreality as he had never once entertained any thoughts of possessingher nor had ever given the least voluntary indulgence to hisinclinations he had a much stronger passion for her than he himself wasacquainted with.An accident occurred on the hunting-field in saving Sophia from her toomettlesome horse kept Jones a prisoner for some time in Mr. Western'shouse and during those weeks he not only found that he loved Sophiawith an unbounded passion but he plainly saw the tender sentiments shehad for him yet could not this assurance lessen his despair ofobtaining the consent of her father nor the horrors which attended hispursuit of her by any base or treacherous method.Hence at the approach of the young lady he grew pale and if this wassudden started. If his eyes accidentally met hers the blood rushedinto his cheeks and his countenance became all over scarlet. If hetouched her his hand nay his whole frame trembled.All these symptoms escaped the notice of the squire but not so ofSophia. She soon perceived these agitations of mind in Jones and was atno loss to discover the cause for indeed she recognised it in her ownbreast. In a word she was in love with him to distraction. It was not
comment676,long before Jones was able to attend her to the harpsichord where shewould kindly condescend for hours together to charm him with the mostdelicious music.The news that Mr. Allworthy was dangerously ill for a servant hadbrought word that he was dying broke off Tom's stay at Mr. Western'sand drove all the thoughts of love out of his head. He hurried instantlyinto the chariot which was sent for him and ordered the coachman todrive with all imaginable haste nor did the idea of Sophia once occurto him on the way._III.--Tom Jones Falls into Disgrace_On the night when the physician announced that Mr. Allworthy was out ofdanger Jones was thrown into such immoderate excess of rapture by thenews that he might be truly said to be drunk with joy--an intoxicationwhich greatly forwards the effects of wine and as he was very freetoo with the bottle on this occasion he became very soon literallydrunk.Jones had naturally violent animal spirits and Thwackum resenting hisspeeches only the doctor's interposition prevented wrath kindling.After which Jones gave loose to mirth sang two or three amorous songsand fell into every frantic disorder which unbridled joy is apt toinspire but so far was he from any disposition to quarrel that he wasten times better-humoured if possible than when he was sober.Blifil whose mother had died during her brother's illness was highlyoffended at a behaviour which was so inconsistent with the sober andprudent reserve of his own temper. The recent death of his mother hedeclared made such conduct very indecent."It would become them better" he said "to express the exultations oftheir hearts at Mr. Allworthy's recovery in thanksgiving than indrunkenness and riot."Wine had not so totally overpowered Jones as to prevent him recollectingBlifil's loss the moment it was mentioned. He at once offered to shakeMr. Blifil by the hand and begged his pardon saying his excessive joyfor Mr. Allworthy's recovery had driven every other thought out of hismind.Blifil scornfully rejected his hand and with an insulting illusion tothe misfortune of Jones's birth provoked the latter to blows. Thescuffle which ensued might have produced mischief had it not been forthe interference of Thwackum and the physician.Blifil however only waited for an opportunity to be revenged on Jonesand the occasion was soon forthcoming when Mr. Allworthy was fullyrecovered from his illness.Mr. Western had found out that his daughter was in love with Tom Jonesand at once decided that she should marry Blifil to whom Sophiaprofessed great abhorrence.As for Blifil the success of Jones was much more grievous to him thanthe loss of Sophia whose estate indeed was dearer to him than herperson.Mr. Western swore that his daughter shouldn't have a ha'penny nor thetwentieth part of a brass farthing if she married Jones and Blifilwith many sighs professed to his uncle that he could not bear thethought of Sophia being ruined by her preference for Jones."This lady I am sure will be undone in every sense for besides theloss of most part of her own fortune she will be married to a beggar.Nay that is a trifle for I know him to be one of the worst men in theworld.""How" said Mr. All worthy. "I command you to tell me what you mean.""You know sir" said Blifil "I never disobeyed you. In the very day ofyour utmost danger when myself and all the family were in tears he
comment677,filled the house with riot and debauchery. He drank and sang androared and when I gave him a gentle hint of the indecency of hisactions he fell into a violent passion swore many oaths called merascal and struck me. I am sure I have forgiven him that long ago. Iwish I could so easily forget his ingratitude to the best ofbenefactors."Thwackum was now sent for and corroborated every circumstance which theother had deposed.Poor Jones was too full of grief at the thought that Western haddiscovered the whole affair between him and Sophia to make any adequatedefence. He could not deny the charge of drunkenness and out of modestysunk everything that related particularly to himself.Mr. Allworthy answered that he was now resolved to banish him from hissight for ever. "Your audacious attempt to steal away a young lady callsupon me to justify my own character in punishing you. And there is nopart of your character which I resent more than your ill-treatment ofthat good young man meaning Blifil who hath behaved with so muchtenderness and honour towards you."A flood of tears now gushed from the eyes of Jones and every faculty ofspeech and motion seemed to have deserted him. It was some time beforehe was able to obey Allworthy's peremptory commands of departing whichhe at length did having first kissed his hands with a passion difficultto be affected and as difficult to be described.Mr. Allworthy however did not permit him to leave the house pennilessbut presented him with a note for 500. He then commanded him to goimmediately and told Jones that his clothes and everything elseshould be sent to him whithersoever he should order them.Jones had hardly set out which he did with feelings of agony anddespair before Sophia Western decided that only in flight could she besaved from marriage with the detested Blifil.Mr. Western in spite of tremendous love for his daughter thought herinclinations of as little consequence as Blifil himself conceived themto be and Mr. Allworthy who said "he would on no account be accessoryto forcing a young lady into a marriage contrary to her own will" wassatisfied by his nephew's disingenuous statement that the young lady'sbehaviour to him was full as forward as he wished it.Sophia having appointed her maid to meet her at a certain place not farfrom the house exactly at the ghostly and dreadful hour of twelvebegan to prepare for her own departure.But first she was obliged to give a painful audience to her father andhe treated her in so violent and outrageous a manner that he frightenedher into an affected compliance with his will which so highly pleasedthe good squire that he at once changed his frowns into smiles and hismenaces into promises.He vowed his whole soul was wrapped in hers that her consent had madehim the happiest of mankind.He then gave her a large bank-bill to dispose of in any trinkets shepleased and kissed and embraced her in the fondest manner.Sophia reverenced her father piously and loved him passionately but thethoughts of her beloved Jones quickly destroyed all the regretfulpromptings of filial love._IV.--Tom Jones's Restoration_After many adventures on the road Mr. Jones reached London and as hehad often heard Mr. Allworthy mention the gentlewoman at whose house in
comment678,Bond Street he used to lodge when he was in town he sought the houseand was soon provided with a room there on the second floor. Mrs.Miller the person who let these lodgings was the widow of a clergymanand Mr. Allworthy had settled an annuity of 50 a year on her "inconsideration of always having her first floor when he was in town."Tom Jones's fortunes were now very soon at the lowest. Having beenforced into a quarrel in the streets with an acquaintance namedFitzpatrick and having wounded him with his sword a number of fellowsrushed in and carried Jones off to the civil magistrate who beinginformed that the wound appeared to be mortal straightway committed theprisoner to the Gatehouse.Sophia Western was also in London at the house of her aunt and soonafterwards Mr. Western Mr. Allworthy and Blifil all reached the city.It was just at this time that Mr. Allworthy consenting to his nephewonce more offering himself to Sophia came with Blifil to his accustomedlodgings in Bond Street. Mrs. Miller to whom Jones had showed manykindnesses at once put in a good word for the unfortunate young manand on Blifil exulting over the manslaughter Jones was alleged to havecommitted declared that the wounded man whoever he was was in fault.This indeed was shortly afterwards corroborated by Fitzpatrickhimself who acknowledged his mistake.But it was not till Mr. Allworthy discovered that Blifil had beenarranging with a lawyer to get the men who had arrested Jones to bearfalse witness and learnt further that Tom Jones was his sisterBridget's child and that on her death-bed Mrs. Blifil's message to herbrother confessing the fact had been suppressed by her son that his oldfeelings of affection for Tom Jones returned. Before setting out tovisit Jones in the prison Mr. Allworthy called on Sophia to inform herthat he regretted Blifil had ever been encouraged to give her annoyanceand that Mr. Jones was his nephew and his heir.Men over-violent in their dispositions are for the most part aschangeable in them. No sooner was Western informed of Mr. Allworthy'sintention to make Jones his heir than he joined heartily with the unclein every commendation of the nephew and became as eager for hisdaughter's marriage with Jones as he had before been to couple her toBlifil.Fitzpatrick being recovered of his wound and admitting the aggression
comment679,Jones was released from custody and returned to his lodgings to meet Mr.Allworthy.It is impossible to conceive a more tender or moving scene than thismeeting between the uncle and nephew. Allworthy received Jones into hisarms. "O my child" he cried "how have I been to blame How have Iinjured you What amends can I ever make you for those unkindsuspicions which I have entertained and for all the sufferings theyhave occasioned you""Am I not now made amends" cried Jones. "Would not my sufferings hadthey been ten times greater have been now richly repaid"Here the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Western whocould no longer be kept away even by the authority of Allworthy himself.Western immediately went up to Jones crying out "My old friend Tom Iam glad to see thee with all my heart. All past must be forgotten. Comealong with me I'll carry thee to thy mistress this moment."Here Allworthy interposed and the squire was obliged to consent todelay introducing Jones to Sophia till the afternoon.Blifil now thoroughly exposed in his treachery was at first sullen andsilent balancing in his mind whether he should yet deny all butfinding at last the evidence too strong against him betook himself toconfession and was now as remarkably mean as he had been beforeremarkably wicked. Mr. Allworthy subsequently settled 200 a year uponhim to which Jones hath privately added a third. Upon this incomeBlifil lives in one of the northern counties. He is also lately turnedMethodist in hopes of marrying a very rich widow of that sect. Sophiawould not at first permit any promise of an immediate engagement withJones because of certain stories of his inconstancy but Mr. Westernrefused to hear of any delay."To-morrow or next day" says Western bursting into the room whereSophia and Jones were alone."Indeed sir" says she "I have no such intention.""But I can tell thee" replied he "why hast not only because thou dostlove to be disobedient and to plague and vex thy father. When I forbidher then it was all nothing but sighing and whining and languishingand writing now I am for thee--this to Jones--she is against thee.All the spirit of contrary that's all. She is above being guided andgoverned by her father that is the whole truth on't. It is only to
comment680,disoblige and contradict me.""What would my papa have me do" cries Sophia."What would I ha' thee do" says he "why gee un thy hand this moment.""Well sir" said Sophia "I will obey you. There is my hand Mr.Jones.""Well and will you consent to ha' un to-morrow morning" says Western."I will be obedient to you sir" cries she."Why then to-morrow morning be the day" cries he."Why then to-morrow morning shall be the day papa since you willhave it so" said Sophia. Jones then fell upon his knees and kissed herhand in an agony of joy while Western began to caper and dance aboutthe room presently crying out "Where the devil is Allworthy" He thensallied out in quest of him and very opportunely left the lovers toenjoy a few tender minutes alone.But he soon returned with Allworthy saying "If you won't believe meyou may ask her yourself. Hast not gin thy consent Sophy to be marriedto-morrow""Such are your commands sir" cries Sophia "and I dare not be guiltyof disobedience.""I hope there is not the least constraint" cries Allworthy."Why there" cried Western "you may bid her unsay all again if youwill. Dost repent heartily of thy promise dost not Sophy""Indeed papa" cried she. "I do not repent nor do I believe I evershall of any promise in favour of Mr. Jones.""Then nephew" cries Allworthy "I felicitate you most heartily for Ithink you are the happiest of men."Mr. Allworthy Mr. Western and Mrs. Miller were the only personspresent at the wedding and within two days of that event Mr. Jones andSophia attended Mr. Western and Mr. Allworthy into the country.There is not a neighbour or a servant who doth not most gratefullybless the day when Mr. Jones was married to Sophia.                                   CAMILLE FLAMMARIONUrania     Camille Flammarion is one of the most remarkable of modern     French scientists. Born on February 25 1842 he was     apprenticed at an early age to an engraver but attracted by     astronomy he studied so well that when a lad of sixteen he     was admitted as a pupil to the Paris Observatory. There is no     doubt that the great French mathematician Le Verrier     regarded Flammarion with a certain disdain as more of a poet     than an astronomer but he soon vindicated by several     important discoveries his title to be regarded as a man of     science. "Urania" which appeared in 1889 is an excellent     example of his ability as a thinker and of his charm as a     writer. The work is hardly a novel though it is far more     popular than many books of fiction. It is really an essay in     philosophy dealing with the question of the immortality of the     soul and it has an especial interest for English readers     owing to the fact that much in it that seems to be pure     fantasy is based on researches undertaken by the British     Society for Psychical Research. The plot and the characters     are of secondary importance they are only used for the     purpose of illustrating certain ideas._I.--The Muse of Astronomy_I was seventeen years old when I fell in love with Urania. Was she afair young blue-eyed daughter of Eve No she was an exquisite statueof the Muse of Astronomy chiselled by Pradier in the days of theEmpire. She stood on the mantelpiece in the study of the famousmathematician Le Verrier who directed the Paris Observatory where Iwas working. At four o'clock in the afternoon my illustrious chief usedto depart and I would then steal into his room and sit down before
comment681,Urania and dream of lovelier worlds than ours hidden in the infinitespaces of the starry sky. Sometimes my friend and companion in studiesGeorges Spero would come and sit beside me and inspired by theimmortal beauty of Urania we would let our young and ardentimaginations play over the glories and wonders of the heavens."You will be too late for Jupiter" said Le Verrier enteringunexpectedly one evening and catching me in an attitude of adorationbefore Urania. "I am afraid you are more of a poet than an astronomer."The great man of science himself certainly did not love beauty as muchas he loved wisdom for the next day he sold the lovely image of Uraniain order to buy an old Chinese astronomical clock. I was almostheartbroken when I entered his room and found that Urania haddisappeared. With her had gone the vivifying power of imagination whichhad transmuted the abstruse calculations on which I was engaged intoglimpses of heavenly visions of infinite life. With what wild joy thendid I see when I returned home Urania shining in all her loveliness onmy own mantelpiece. Knowing my love for the beautiful figure of themuse Georges Spero had bought it back from the watchmaker to whom LeVerrier had sent it and placed it in my room as a gift.It was an extraordinary mark of friendship for Georges loved Uraniaeven more passionately than I did. To him she was the personification ofeverything in life that lifted man above the level of the brute.Possessing a nobler and finer intellect than mine he had thrown himselfinto the study of the problems of the soul with a fury of passion and aconcentration of thought that almost killed him. Are our souls immortalor do they perish with our bodies This was the question that tormentedhim to madness. One night I found him sitting in his room in the Placedu Panthon with a glass of poison in his hand."This is the quickest road to the knowledge I want" he said with asmile. "I shall soon know if the soul is immortal."He had been dissecting a skull and by his side was a microscope withwhich he had been studying the grey matter of the brain. Convinced atlast of the uncertainty of the positive sciences he had fallen intoviolent despair. But Urania was at hand to comfort him and his mindbecame calmer and clearer when we ceased to talk about earthly thingsand ascended into high regions of philosophic speculation over which themuse of heaven presides."Ah Camille" he exclaimed "the Uranian way is the best. It is only bystudying the heavens that we shall be able to understand this littleearth of ours and the part we play in it. Look at the midnight skystreaming with the light of infinite suns and filled with an unendingprocession of worlds in which the spirit of life clothes itself in anunimaginable variety of forms. This clot of dust on which we live willgrow cold and break and scatter in the abysses of space. But it is notour home we are only passengers and when our journey here is donefairer mansions are waiting for us in the depths of the sky. If I diebefore you I will return and convince you of this truth."Returning to the study of astronomy Spero built up a system ofphilosophy which made him at the age of twenty-five one of the mostfamous men in France._II.--Love and Death_By way of relief from his severer work Georges Spero resolved to go toNorway and study the wild and beautiful phenomena of the AuroraBorealis and I went with him. One morning as we were standing on amountain looking at a magnificent sunrise I saw a girl climbing aneighbouring peak. She did not perceive us but when she reached thesummit the image of Spero was thrown on a cloud in front of her by oneof those curious plays of sunlight and mist which sometimes occur inhazy mountainous regions. His fine austere features and graceful
comment682,figure were enlarged into a vast god-like apparition with a halo ofbright colours shining like a glory around his head and a faintercircle of rainbow hues framing his whole form. It was the first antheliathat the lovely girl had seen and it filled her with wonder and awe.Theirs was a strange courtship--Spero's and Iclea's. The lovely youngNorwegian lady had recently lost her mother and being like many of thecultivated women of Northern Europe somewhat dubious of the dogmas ofreligion she had found death a terrible mystery when it was thusbrought sharply home to her. She was wandering in the dreadful labyrinthof modern doubt vainly seeking to forget her trouble in the excitementsof mountaineering when she saw the unearthly apparition of the youngFrench philosopher. A study of his works heightened the feeling of awewith which she already regarded him. At first there was no room for lovein the passionate desire after knowledge which drew her to him. She wasmerely a disciple sitting at the feet of the great master. Accompaniedby her father she continued her studies under him when he returned toParis and for three months they were bound together wholly byintellectual interest. For several hours every day they studied side byside and much of Iclea's time was spent in translating papers inforeign languages bearing on subjects in which Georges was interested.One morning he arrived earlier than usual his eyes shining with joy."I have settled the problem" he cried leaning against the mantelpiece."At least" he added with his usual modesty "I have settled it to myown satisfaction."Striding up and down the room he rapidly sketched out a system ofphilosophy in which the ultimate truths of modern science weretransformed into the bases of religion. Iclea listened to him in silenceas he went on to explain the spiritual forces still dormant in the humansoul."We are still in our spiritual infancy" he said. "It is scarcely fourthousand years since mankind began to manifest its higher powers. Ourgreatest conquests over nature are all of recent date and they are thework of a few noble souls who have erected themselves above the animalconditions of life. The reign of brute force is over and I am certainthat as soon as we learn to exercise the powers of our soul we shallacquire transcendental faculties that will enable us to transportourselves from one world to another.""That too is my belief" said Iclea.Georges bent over her and gazed into her eyes of heavenly blue throughwhich her very soul was speaking. There was a strange silence and thentheir lips met.                                   For some months I lost sight of my two friends. In the ecstasy of theirlove they forgot for a while the problems of philosophy which hadbrought them together. The joys of intellectual communion were submergedand almost lost in the new strange feeling which crowned and glorifiedtheir lives. Hand in hand the lovers wandered about Paris which had nowbecome to them a city in fairyland. Meeting them one evening on thebanks of the Seine I learned that they were returning to Norway withIclea's father and that they were to be married at Christiania on theanniversary of the mysterious apparition on the mountain which hadbrought them together. Georges was about to resume his interruptedstudies of the Aurora Borealis which he wished to trace to its sourceby means of a balloon ascent and Iclea intended to accompany him in hisvoyage through the air.To my great regret I was unable to go with them to Norway as my dutiesas an astronomer kept me in Paris. I anxiously awaited thatextraordinary agitation of the magnetic needle which announces theexistence of an Aurora Borealis in Northern Europe. When at last themagnetic perturbation occurred in the observatory I rejoiced to thinkthat Spero and his bride were floating high feasting their eyes on themost gorgeous of spectacles.But suddenly an indefinable feeling of uneasiness came over me which
comment683,grew into a dreadful presentiment of disaster. Long before the telegramarrived from Christiania I knew what had happened. Georges and Icleawere deadEvery reader of the newspapers next morning knew as much as I did. Anescape of gas which could not be stopped sent the balloon hurtling tothe earth. Spero threw everything movable out of the car in a vainattempt to lighten it and break the force of the descent. The balloonstill kept falling then Iclea with a wild courage born of love savedGeorges' life by leaping out of the car. Relieved of her weight theballoon rose up but Spero had now no wish to live. He jumped out with awild cry and his body crashed on the edge of the lake into which Icleahad fallen. There the mortal remains of the two lovers now lie coveredby a single stone. But where were their soulsOne night Georges Spero remembered his promise to me and returned toearth._III.--A Soul from Mars_Sitting alone on the top of the ancient castle of Montlhry I wasconducting an experiment in optics by means of electrical communicationswith two assistants at Paris and Juvisy. I was trying to find out if therays of different colours in the spectrum travel at the same rate. Itwas just on midnight before I brought the experiment to a successfulconclusion. As I covered up my instruments some one said "You wouldnot have brought that off Camille if it had not been for me. I gaveyou the idea of comparing the violet vibrations with the red."I turned round with a cry of fear. Georges Spero was sitting in themoonlight on the parapet looking at me with a smile."Are you afraid of me Camille" he said."You Georges You" I stammered. "Is it really you Keep still and letme touch you."I put my hands on his face and stroked his hair and felt his body. Icould no longer doubt that I had him before me in the actual flesh buthe read my thoughts."You are mistaken Camille" he said. "My real body is asleep on Mars.""So you still live" I exclaimed. "You have solved the great problem.And Iclea""Let us sit here and talk" he replied. "There are many things I want totell you."My fears had vanished and I sat by my beloved friend."It seemed to me" said Georges "that my fall from the balloon knockedme senseless. When I came to I was lying in the darkness with theripple of lake-water breaking on my ear. What amazed me was a strangesense of lightness that made me feel I could rise up and float away if Iwanted to. Thinking this was a disorder of the mind I did not attemptto move but watched with wondering eyes the sky above me. It waslighted by two strange moons. When the day broke and showed around me aworld of unimaginable splendour I knew the meaning of the two moons andof my strange feeling of lightness. I was a disembodied spirit that hadbeen transported to Mars."Do you know Camille that the soul is able to choose its mortalcovering This is at least the case on Mars. For some time I wandered
comment684,about in an invisible form studying the conditions of life there.Animal strength I found counted for nothing. The Martians are anaerial race with exquisite senses which respond in a way unknown onearth to spiritual influences. Do you remember I read your thoughts whenwe first met and answered them before you spoke That is one of theMartians' gifts. Finding that these wonderful faculties were betterdeveloped in the women of Mars than in the men I chose the feminineform for my reincarnation.""And Iclea" I said."Iclea" said Spero "was re-born in a masculine shape. It was partlybecause of the mystic attraction that I felt for her that I chose theother form. Neither of us remembered our earthly existence but a vagueyet deep sentiment of our spiritual relationship made me seek her outand unite myself to her. It was your beloved muse Uriana" he added"who revealed the ties that bound us in our former lives."Owing to their superior faculties the Martians have carried everyscience to a perfection undreamt of on this earth. In astronomicalobservations for instance they employ a system of telephotography. Forthousands of years their instruments have been photographing on anunending roll of paper the wild spectacle of terrestrial life."One day as Iclea and I were examining recent photographs we saw apicture of Paris during the Great Exhibition. Seizing a microscope welooked at the figures and recognised ourselves among them. Strangememories stirred within us and we stared at each other in silentamazement. Suddenly I remembered the sacred words I learnt at mymother's knee. Yes there were many mansions in our Father's house Theblood-stained planet from which we had escaped was neither the cradlenor the grave of His children."Then we wept as we thought of the cruelty ignorance misery andgrossness of existence on earth. It was dear Camille with no joy thatI recollected the promise I had made to you. But you see I havecarried it out. I wish to convince you and through you all the restof mankind that the soul is immortal and that the earth is only atemporary stage of existence in a spiritual progress in which the wholeuniverse is included.""But how is it possible for you Georges" I interrupted "to appear tome in the body you wore on earth""All this" said Spero touching his body "is an illusion. Do you notrecollect my saying that only invisible things are real You do not seeme with your eyes or feel me with your hands as you think you do. Theimpression which you have of my presence is born of the influence whichmy mind is exerting in an invisible way on your mind. Can't youunderstand It is a kind of hypnotism. At the present moment as I havesaid I am lying asleep on Mars but my spirit is in directcommunication with yours. The form you see sitting beside you on thisparapet is only an illusion of your senses. My soul is speaking to yoursoul.""But could you not" I said "give me some description of life on Mars""A dream" he replied "would be more vivid than a mere descriptionthough it would only be a shadow of the reality. For since you have notmy dear friend our exquisite faculties of knowledge your mind could
comment685,not clearly mirror our life. Hark Iclea is awake and calling me. Icannot stay any longer. Shut your eyes and I will send you a dream."I turned to say good-bye but Spero had vanished. A deep drowsiness fellupon me and just as I got off the parapet and found a safer position Ifell asleep._IV.--The Eternal Progress_I was sitting under a strange tree covered with gigantic red flowers. Inthe sky above me were two moons that shed a dim brightness on the lovelyand fantastic scenery. A multitude of radiant shapes fluttered anddarted through the air. They were Martians--exquisite aerial anddivinely beautiful figures glowing with luminous tints. Airy gondolaswhich seemed to be fashioned from phosphorescent flowers passed abovemy head and one of them floated down to the tree under which I waslying. In it were Iclea and Georges but etherealised beyond the reachof human imagination.They took me in their flying chariot as day was breaking and wecoursed with a strange silent interchange of thoughts over theorange-coloured land of Mars. I could not understand everything whichwas communicated to me now by Iclea and now by Georges but I perceivedthat all manual labour on the planet was done by means of machinesdirected by animals whose intelligence was on a level with my own. TheMartians themselves lived only for the things of the mind they hadtwelve senses instead of five and their bodies in which electricityplayed the part that blood does in our systems were so finely and yetso strongly organised that they possessed an extraordinary power overthe forces of nature. Everything on their world seas mountains andrivers were like their wonderful canals works of art and science.Nature was completely plastic in their hands. There was no poverty andno crime. Deriving their food from the air which they breathe theMartians were liberated from material cares and immersed in the joys ofintellectual pursuits."You now see Camille" said Spero resorting at last to language whichI could clearly understand "that life on Mars has developed aspeacefully and nobly as it began. There is no break between ourvegetable kingdom and our animal kingdom. We are nourished like yourplants trees and herbs by the air which we breathe. Ten million yearsago your world was also a scene of innocence and tranquil felicity. Theland was overgrown with a wildly beautiful vegetation that fed on thegentle winds of heaven and primitive forms of animal life had spreadfrom the depths of the sea along the shallow shores and were therelearning to extract from the air a nourishment similar to that whichthey obtained from the water. But by a woeful chance one of yourprimitive animals--a deaf blind sexless clot of jelly--then had itsbody pierced by a drop of sea-water thicker than usual and it foundthat this way of feeding was quicker than simple respiration. Such wasthe origin of the first digestive tube which has exercised so balefulan influence on the course of terrestrial life and turned the earthinto a vast slaughterhouse.""Is there no hope for us" I said."No" he replied "the earth is a shipwrecked planet. None of the higherorganisms there will ever rise to our level. How can they alter thestructure of their bodies and empty their veins of blood and fill themwith the subtle electricity which serves us as a life force And thegrossness of their blood-fed senses How can all the fine powers of theimmortal soul ever develop along with such degraded instruments ofknowledge""But even if our earth is a shipwrecked planet" I exclaimed "there isat least some means of escaping from it. You and Iclea for instance----""Yes there is a way of escape" said Spero "the Uranian way. By
comment686,soaring aloft into the serene region of spiritual ideas a terrestrialsoul can still free itself from its animality. Some save themselves bytheir high moral qualities others are purified and uplifted by theirimagination and intellect. Virtue and science are the wings that enableearth-born spirits to mount the skies. The destiny of a soul isdetermined by its works and aspirations. Lovers of knowledge sojournawhile on Mars which is only the first stage in the eternal progress.Spirits animated by divine feelings rise at once into high regions ofstarry splendour. The Uranian way is open to all and the day willarrive when every inhabitant of your wild dark planet will recognisethat he too is a citizen of heaven. Then Urania will at last inspireand direct him and point out the path by which he can ascend from theblood-stained earth to the fairer mansions prepared for him in theskies."As he was speaking our aerial chariot floated down to a fairy palace bythe shore of an enchanted sea. I alighted and a radiant flower-likemaiden who was standing by the portal unfolded her rainbow wings andshadowed me with them and murmured "Do you wish to return to earth""No" I cried running up to clasp her in my arms.I awoke with a sudden shock. I was lying on the top of the tower ofMontlhry the sun was rising and the vast circle of country below meshone clear and distinct in the morning light."Was it a dream" I said to myself. "Surely not. The earth is not theonly home of life in the universe. Urania the celestial muse is nowunfolding before our astonished eyes the panoramas of infinity and weknow at last that we are not the children of the earth but citizens ofthe heavens."                                   DE LA MOTTE FOUQUUndine     Friedrich Heinrich Karl Fouqu Baron de la Motte was born at     Brandenburg in Prussia Feb. 12 1777 and died in Berlin     January 23 1843. The mixed nationality indicated by his name     is accounted for by his descent from a French Huguenot family.     He served as a Prussian cavalryman in the two campaigns     against Napoleon of 1792 and 1813 but during the long     interval between devoted himself actively to intellectual     culture and literary pursuits. He began his career as an     author by translating the "Numancia" of Cervantes but his     admiration of the ancient Norse sagas and the old German     legends led him into the composition of exquisitely beautiful     and tender though exceedingly fantastic romances which     speedily gained immense popularity. In these productions fairy     and magical elements predominate. His masterpiece is "Undine"     published in 1814 the other best-known works being "Sintram"     "Aslauga's Knight" and "The Two Captains." In all Fouqu's     stories the marks of genius appear in his brilliant     imagination and pure and fascinating diction._I.--The Water Sprite_About a century ago an aged fisherman sat mending his nets by hiscottage door in front of a lovely lake. Behind his dwelling stretched asombre forest reputed to be haunted by goblin creatures. Through thisgloomy solitude the pious old fisherman frequently passed religiouslydispelling all terrors by singing hymns as he went with his fish to atown near the border of the forest.One evening he heard the sound of a horse's hoofs and presentlyappeared a knight riding on a splendid steed and clad in resplendent
comment687,armour. The stranger stopped and besought shelter for the night andthe good old fisherman accorded him a most cheery welcome taking himinto the cottage where sat his aged wife by a scanty fire. Soon thethree were freely conversing. The knight told of his travels andrevealed that he was Sir Huldbrand of Ringstetten where he had a castleby the Rhine.A splash against the window surprising the guest he was informed by hishost with some little show of vexation that little tricks were oftenplayed by a foster-child of the old couple named Undine a girl ofeighteen.The door flew open and a lovely girl glided laughing into the room.Without the slightest token of shyness she gazed at the knight for a fewmoments then asked why he had come to the poor cottage."Have you come through the wild forest"He confessed that he had and she instantly demanded a recital of hisadventures. With a slight shudder at his own recollections of thestrange creatures he had encountered Huldbrand consented but a reprooffrom the fisherman at her obtrusiveness angered Undine. The girl sprangup and rushed forth into the night exclaiming "Sleep alone in yoursmoky old hut"In great alarm the fisherman and Huldbrand rose to follow the girl butshe had vanished in the darkness. Remarking that she had acted sobefore the old fisherman invited Huldbrand to sit by the fire and talkawhile and began to relate how Undine had come to live with them.The couple had lost their only child a wonderfully beautiful littlegirl. At the age of three when sitting in her mother's lap at the edgeof the lake she seemed to be attracted by some lovely apparition in thewater for suddenly stretching out her hands and laughing she had in amoment sprung into the lake. No trace of the child could ever be found.But the same evening a lovely little girl three or four years old withwater streaming from her golden tresses suddenly entered the cottagesmiling sweetly at the fisherman and his wife. They hastily undressedthe little stranger and put her to bed. She uttered not a word butsimply smiled. In the morning she talked a little confusedly tellinghow she had been in a boat on the lake with her mother and had fallenin and could recollect nothing more. She could say nothing as to whoshe was or whence she came. But she talked often of golden castles andcrystal domes.While the fisherman was talking thus to the knight he was suddenlyinterrupted by the noise of rushing water. Floods seemed to be burstingforth and he and his guest going hastily to the door saw by themoonlight that the brook which issued from the forest was surging in awild torrent over its margin while a roaring wind was lashing the lake.In great alarm both shouted "Undine Undine" But there was noresponse and the two ran off in different directions in search of thefugitive.It was Huldbrand who discovered the girl. Clambering down some rocks atthe edge of the stream thinking Undine might have fallen there he washailed by the sweet voice of the girl herself."Venture not" she cried. "The old man of the stream is full of tricks."Looking across at a tiny isle in the stream the knight saw her nestlingin the grass smiling and in an instant he had crossed."The fisherman is distressed at your absence" said he. "Let us goback."Looking at him with her beautiful blue eyes the girl replied. "If youthink so well whatever you think is right to me."Taking Undine in his arms Huldbrand bore her over the stream to the
comment688,cottage where she was received with joy. Dawn was breaking andbreakfast was prepared under the trees. Undine flung herself on thegrass at Huldbrand's feet and at her renewed request the knight toldthe story of his forest adventures."It is now about eight days since I rode into the city on the other sideof the forest to join in a great tournament. In one of the intervalsbetween the jousts I noticed a lovely lady among the spectators. Ilearned that she was Bertalda foster-daughter of a great duke and eachevening I became her partner in the dances."This Bertalda was a wayward girl and each day pleased me less andless but I continued in her company and asked her jestingly to give mea glove. She said she would do so if I would explore alone the hauntedforest. As an honourable knight I could not decline the challenge andyesterday I set out on the enterprise. Before I had penetrated very farwithin the glades I saw what looked like a bear in the branches of anoak but the creature in a harsh human voice growled that it wasgetting branches with which to roast me at night. My horse was scared atthis and other grim apparitions but at last I emerged from the forestand saw the lake and this cottage."When he had finished the fisherman spoke of the best way by which thevisitor could return to the city but with sly laughter Undinedeclared that the knight could not depart for if he attempted now tocross the deluged wood he would be overwhelmed._II.--"I Have No Soul"_Huldbrand detained at the cottage by the increasing overflow of thestream enjoyed the most perfect satisfaction with his sojourn.The old folks with pleasure regarded the two young people as beingbetrothed and Huldbrand assumed that he was accepted by the girl whomhe had come to look upon as not being in reality one of this poorhousehold but one of some illustrious family and when one evening anaged priest appeared at the cottage driven in by the storm Huldbrandaddressed to him a request that he should on the spot at once unite himand the maiden as they were pledged to each other. A discussion arose
comment689,but matters were at length settled and the old wife produced twoconsecrated tapers. Lighting these the priest with brief solemnceremony celebrated the nuptials.Undine had been quiet and grave during these proceedings but a singularchange took place in her demeanour as soon as the rite had beenperformed. She began at intervals to indulge in wild freaks teasing thepriest and indulging in a variety of silly tricks. At length the priestgently expostulated with Undine exhorting her so to attune her soulthat it might always be in concord with that of her husband.Her reply amazed the listeners for she said "If one has no soul as Ihave none what is there to harmonise" Then she burst into a fit ofpassionate weeping to the consternation of all the little company. Asshe again and again wept the priest fearing that she was possessed bysome evil spirit sought to exorcise it. The priest turned to thebridegroom with the assurance that he could discover nothing evil in thebride mysterious though her behaviour was and he commended him to beloving and true to her.The next morning Undine when she and her husband made their appearanceresponded gracefully to the paternal greeting of the priest beseechinghis pardon for her folly of the previous evening and begging him topray for the good of her soul. Through the whole day Undine behavedangelically. She was kind quiet and gentle. At eventide she led herhusband out to the edge of the stream which to the wonder ofHuldbrand had subsided into gentle rippling waves.She whispered "Carry me across to that little isle and we will decidethere."Wondering he carried her across and laying her on the turf listenedas she began."My loved one know that there are strange beings which though seemingalmost mortals are rarely visible to human eyes--salamanders in theflames gnomes down in the earth spirits in the air. And in the waterare myriads of spirits dwelling in crystal domes in the coral-treesand in the lovely shells. These are far more beautiful than the fairestof human beings and sometimes a fisherman has seen a tender mermaidand has listened to her song. Such wonderful creatures are calledUndines and one of these you see now before you"We should be far superior to other beings--for we consider ourselveshuman--but for one defect. We have no souls and nothing remains of usafter this mortal life is over. Yet every being aspires to rise higherand so my father who is a great water prince in the Mediterranean Seadesired that his only daughter should become possessed of a soul. Butthis can only come to pass with loving union with one of your race. NowO my dearly beloved I have to thank you that I am gifted with a souland it will be due to you should all my life be made wretched. For what
comment690,will become of me if you forsake me If you would do so do it now ThenI will plunge into the stream--which is my uncle--and as he brought mehere so will he take me back to my parents a loving suffering womanwith a soul."Undine would have said yet more but Huldbrand astonishing though therecital was with tears and kisses vowed he would never leave his lovelywife and with her leaning in loving trustfulness on his arm theyreturned to the hut.The next day at Undine's strange urgency farewell was said with bittertears and lamentations.Undine was placed on the beautiful horse and Huldbrand and the priestwalked on either side as the three passed through the solemn glades ofthe wood. A fourth soon joined them. He was dressed in a white robelike that of the priest and presently attempted to speak to Undine. Butshe shrank from him declaring she wished to have nothing to do withhim."Oh oh" cried the stranger with a laugh. "What kind of a marriage isthis you have made that you must not speak to your relative Do you notknow I am your uncle Khleborn who brought you to this region and thatI am here to protect you from goblins and sprites So let me quietlyaccompany you.""We are near the end of the forest and shall not need you further" washer rejoinder. But he grinned at her so frightfully that she shriekedfor help and the knight aimed at his head a blow from his sword.Instantly Khleborn was transformed into a gushing waterfall foamingover them from a rock near by and drenching all three._III.--"Woe Woe"_The sudden disappearance of the young knight had caused a sensation inthe city for the duke and duchess and the friends and servants ofHuldbrand feared he had perished in the forest during the terribletempest When he suddenly reappeared all rejoiced except Bertalda whowas profoundly vexed at seeing with him a beautiful bride. She so farreconciled herself to the conditions that a warm friendship sprang upbetween Undine and herself.It was agreed that Bertalda should accompany the wedded pair toRingstetten and with the consent of the noble foster-parents ofBertalda the three appointed a day for departure. One beautiful eveningas they walked about the market-place round the great fountain suddenlya tall man emerged from among the people and stopped in front of Undine.He quickly whispered something in her ear and though at first sheseemed vexed at the intrusion presently she clapped her hands andlaughed joyously. Then the stranger mysteriously vanished and seemed todisappear in the fountain.Huldbrand had suspected that he had seen the man before and now feltassured that he was Khleborn. Undine admitted the fact and said thather uncle had told her a secret which she was to reveal on the thirdday afterwards which would be the anniversary of Bertalda's nameday.The anniversary came and strange incidents happened. After the banquetgiven by the duke and duchess Undine suddenly gave a signal and fromamong the retainers at the door came forth the old fisherman and hiswife and Undine declared that in these Bertalda saw her real parents.The proud maiden instantly flew into a violent rage weepingpassionately and utterly refused to acknowledge the old couple as herfather and mother. She declared that Undine was an enchantress and awitch sustaining intercourse with evil spirits.Undine with great dignity indignantly denied the accusation whileBertalda's violent conduct created a feeling of disgust in the minds ofall in the assembly. The matter was settled in a simple manner for theduke commanded Bertalda to withdraw to a private apartment with theduchess and the two old folks from the hut that an investigation might
comment691,be made. It was soon over for the noble lady was able presently toinform the company that Undine's story was absolutely true. The guestssilently departed and Undine sank sobbing into her husband's arms.Next day Bertalda humbled by these events sought pardon of Undine forher evil behaviour and was instantly welcomed with loving assurances offorgiveness moreover she was cordially invited to go with the pair toRingstetten."We will share all things there as sisters" said Undine.The three journeyed to the distant castle and took up their abodetogether. Soon Khleborn appeared on the scene but Undine at oncerepulsed him. Next when her husband was one day hunting she orderedthe great well in the courtyard to be covered with a big stone on whichshe cut some curious characters.Bertalda waywardly complained that this proceeding deprived her of waterthat was good for her complexion but Undine privately explained toHuldbrand that she had caused the servants to seal up this springbecause only by that way of access could her uncle Khleborn come todisturb their peace.As time passed on Huldbrand gradually cooled toward his wife and turnedaffectionately towards Bertalda. Undine bore patiently and silently thesorrow thus inflicted on her. But when her husband was impatient andangry she would plead with him never to speak to her in accents ofunkindness when they happened to be on the water for the water spiritshad her completely in their power on their element and would seek toprotect her and even seize her and take her down for ever to dwell inthe crystal castles of the deep.After some estrangements Undine and Bertalda had again become lovingfriends and Huldbrand's affection for his wife had revived with its oldand welcome warmth while the attachment between him and Bertalda seemedforgotten.One day the three were enjoying a delightful excursion on the gloriousDanube. Bertalda had taken off a beautiful coral necklace whichHuldbrand had given her. She leaned over and drew the coral beads acrossthe surface enjoying the glitter thus caused when suddenly a greathand from beneath seized the necklace and snatched it down. The maiden's
comment692,scream of terror was answered by mocking laughter from the water.In an outburst of passion Huldbrand started up and poured forth curseson the river and its denizens whether spirits or sirens. With tears inher eyes Undine besought him softly not to scold her there and shetook from her neck a beautiful necklace and offered it to Bertalda as acompensation.But the angry knight snatched it away and hurled it into the riverexclaiming "Are you still connected with them In the name of all thewitches remain among them with your presents and leave us mortals inpeace you sorceress"Bitterly weeping and crying "Woe Woe" she vanished over the side ofthe vessel. Her last words were "Remain true Woe Woe" Huldbrand layswooning on the deck and little waves seemed to be sobbing on thesurface of the Danube "Woe Woe Remain true"_IV.--The White Stranger_For a time deep sorrow fell on the lord of Ringstetten and Bertalda.They lived long in the castle quietly often weeping for Undinetenderly cherishing her memory. Undine often visited Huldbrand in hisdreams caressing him and weeping silently so that his cheeks were wetwhen he awoke. But these visions grew less frequent and the knight'sgrief diminished by degrees. At length he and Bertalda were married butit was in spite of a grave warning from Father Heilmann who declaredthat Undine had appeared to him in visions beseeching him to warnHuldbrand and Bertalda to leave each other. They were too infatuated toheed the admonition and a priest from a neighbouring monastery promisedto perform the ceremony in a few days.Meantime when lying between sleeping and waking the knight seemedfanned by the wings of a swan and as he fell asleep seemed bornealong on the wings of swans which sang their sweetest music. All at oncehe seemed to be hovering over the Mediterranean Sea. Its waters were socrystalline that he could see through them to the bottom and thereunder a crystal arch sat Undine weeping bitterly. She seemed not toperceive him. Khleborn approached her and told her that Huldbrand wasto be wedded again and that it would be her duty from which nothingcould release her to end his life."That I cannot do" said she. "I have sealed up the fountain against myrace."Huldbrand felt as if he were soaring back again over the sea and atlength he seemed to reach his castle. He awoke on his couch but hecould not bring himself to break off the arrangements that had beenmade.The marriage feast at Ringstetten was not as bright and happy as suchoccasions usually are for a veil of gloom seemed to rest over thecompany. Even the bride affected a happy and thoughtless demeanour whichshe did not really feel. The company dispersed early Bertalda retiringwith her maidens and Huldbrand with his attendants.In her apartment Bertalda with a sigh noticed how freckled was herneck and a remark she made to her maidens as she gazed in the mirrorexcited the eager attention of one of them. She heard her fair mistresssay "Oh that I had a flask of the purifying water from the closedfountain" Presently the officious waiting-woman was seen leading men tothe fountain. With levers they quickly lifted the stone for somemysterious force within seemed to aid them.Then from the fountain solemnly rose a white column of water. It waspresently perceived that it was a pale female figure veiled in white.She was weeping bitterly as she walked slowly to the building whileBertalda and her attendants pale with terror watched from the window.
comment693,The figure passed on and at the door of Huldbrand's room where theknight was partly undressed was heard a gentle tap. The white figureslowly entered. It was Undine who softly said "They have opened thespring and now I am here and you must die." Said the knight "It mustbe so But let me die in your embrace.""Most gladly my loved one" said she throwing back her veil anddisclosing her face divinely smiling. Imprinting on his lips a sacredkiss Undine clasped the knight in her arms weeping as if she wouldweep her very soul away. Huldbrand fell softly back on the pillows ofhis couch a corpse.At the funeral of Huldbrand the veiled figure appeared when theprocession formed a circle round the grave. All knelt in mute devotionat a signal from Father Heilmann. When they rose again the whitestranger had vanished and on the spot where she had knelt a silverylittle fountain gushed forth which almost encircled the grave and thenran on till it reached a lake near by. And to this day the inhabitantscherish the tradition that thus the poor rejected Undine still lovinglyembraces her husband.                                   MILE GABORIAU"File No. 113"     mile Gaboriau one of the best-known exponents of the "police     story" was born at Saujon in France on November 9 1833. He     began life in a lawyer's office became a volunteer in a     cavalry regiment and later secretary to Paul Feval the     novelist and dramatist. In the meantime Gaboriau had     contributed a number of sketches dealing with military and     fashionable life to various minor Parisian journals but it     was not until 1866 with the publication of "L'Affaire     Lerouge" that he suddenly sprang into fame. From that time     until his death on September 28 1873 story after story     appeared rapidly from his pen. "File No. 113" "Le Dossier     113" was published in 1867 and was the first of a remarkable     series of detective tales introducing the figure of Lecoq.     "File No. 113" is perhaps the most characteristic specimen of     his work exhibiting as it does a careful study of the Paris     police system and a thorough acquaintance with all phases of     criminal life.
comment694,_I.--The Robbery and a Clue_The first mention of the celebrated robbery which took place at M.Fauvel's bank in Paris--the _dossier_ of the case is numbered 113 in thepolice files--appeared in the evening papers February 28 1866.On the previous day a certain Count Louis de Clameran sent word to M.Fauvel that he wished to withdraw the following morning at ten o'clockthe sum of 12000 which had been deposited in the bank by his brotheran ironmaster from the south of France who had recently died.M. Fauvel made it a rule never to keep any large sums of money on thepremises but to deposit all such amounts in the keeping of the Bank ofFrance. As this sum however had to be paid the first thing in themorning the chief cashier M. Prosper Bertomy thought he was justifiedin obtaining the amount from the Bank of France on the evening of the27th and in locking it up in the bank safe against the morning.The safe was a formidable-looking affair constructed entirely of wroughtiron of treble thickness. An ingenious device regulated its opening. Onthe massive door were five movable steel buttons engraved with theletters of the alphabet. Before the key could be inserted in the lockthese buttons had to be manipulated in the same order in which they hadbeen used when the safe was last shut. The buttons were arranged so thatthe letters on them formed some word which was changed from time totime. This word was known only to M. Fauvel and his cashier each ofwhom possessed a key of the safe.As soon as the bank opened on the morning of February 28 the count putin an appearance and Prosper Bertomy went to the safe to obtain themoney. When a second later he reappeared his face was ashy pale andhis steps tottered as he walked. The 12000 had disappeared from withinthe safe. What made the affair all the more mysterious was that the safewas locked just as the cashier had left it the night before.The room in which the safe was situated communicated with the bank byanother room in which every night a tried servant of the establishmentslept. By a second door admittance was obtained to the privateapartments of M. and Madame Fauvel and their niece Madeline.As soon as M. Fauvel had heard the startling news he first obtained thenecessary money from the Bank of France settled the business with thecount and then turned his attention to the elucidation of the robbery.He summoned the cashier to his presence.Bertomy was a young man of thirty to whom M. Fauvel had shown greatkindness advancing his interests wherever possible until though veryyoung for the position he was his most important and most confidentialemployee. Besides the paternal affection with which the bank managerregarded his cashier another tie tended to make their relations all thestronger and more personal. Bertomy loved M. Fauvel's niece Madelineand though a curious estrangement had sprung up between them during theprevious nine or ten months the banker always regarded their marriage
comment695,as practically arranged.The interview between the two men was a curious one. To each it appearedthat the other must be the thief. They alone had the keys of the safethey alone knew the magic word which could open the massive door. Thebanker urged Bertomy to confess promising him forgiveness the otherhaughtily rejected the suggestion and hinted that his employer hadconverted the 12000 to his own use. In the end M. Fauvel lost histemper sent for the police and before twenty-four hours were upProsper Bertomy who but the day before had held one of the mostimportant and envied positions in the financial world of Paris wascharged before a magistrate as being a common thief.Investigation of the case was at first entrusted to a detective namedFanferlot nicknamed by his comrades the "Squirrel." Fanferlot'sexamination of the premises resulted in little. All he discovered was ascratch upon the door of the safe but certain words that passed betweenM. Fauvel and his niece which seemed to indicate that the former wassecretly opposed to the marriage of Madeline with Bertomy caused him tojump to the conclusion that the banker had robbed his own safe in orderto bring disgrace upon his cashier. He connived however at the arrestof Bertomy hoping that later on he might obtain great kudos for himselfby unmasking the banker. What might have been the result of his improperand unofficial methods will never be known but in all probability greatinconvenience would have been caused to a number of innocent persons andthe whole course of justice thwarted had it not been for theintervention of the great and famous M. Lecoq.M. Lecoq's interest in the bank robbery case was largely a personal one.Even detectives have hearts and M. Lecoq had loved with heart and soula charming young girl named Nina Gipsy. Under the name of Caldas in oneof his innumerable disguises he had wooed her for many months. When hethought at last that he had won her affections she had fled to theprotection of no less a person than Prosper Bertomy himself. The cashiercared nothing for her but embittered by an estrangement that had sprungup between Madeline and himself he had sought forgetfulness in hersociety. Bertomy's arrest gave Lecoq an opportunity for a noble revenge.He determined to prove to the woman he loved his superiority over hisrival by saving the cashier from disgrace.Though the case looked black against Bertomy for it was shown that hewas heavily in debt and living far beyond his means Lecoq wassatisfied that he had not committed the crime. When Fanferlothopelessly befogged called for his advice at his house in the RueMontmartre the great detective deigned to explain the preliminary dataand the deductions from the data he had made.The scratch on the safe door slight and minute as it was was hisstarting-point. How had it been made He had found by experiment that itwas impossible to make such a scratch upon the varnish without theexercise of considerable force. It was clear therefore that thescratch by the keyhole could not have been made by the thief in histrembling anxiety to get the business he had undertaken accomplished.But why was such force usedFor a long time Lecoq puzzled over this problem. Then with Fanferlothe tried an experiment. In his room was an iron box varnished like thesafe. Taking the key of this box from his pocket he ordered Fanferlotto seize his arm just as he put it near the lock. The key slippedpulled away from the lock and sliding along the surface of the doorleft upon it a diagonal scratch almost an exact reproduction of the oneon the safe.From this simple experiment Lecoq deduced that two people were presentwhen the safe was robbed one wanted to take the money the other wantedto prevent it being taken. This was the basis of the case which he setout to draw up against some person or persons unknown. He argued with
comment696,his usual clear logic that neither Fauvel nor Bertomy could have robbedthe safe. Both of them had keys both of them knew the secret word andcould have robbed the safe whenever they pleased. Therefore neither ofthem would have committed the theft in the presence of somebody else._II.--A Mysterious Journey_Lecoq's first steps after establishing these preliminary deductions wasto secure the release of Bertomy on the grounds of insufficientevidence.On the very morning of his release Bertomy had received a mysteriousletter composed of printed words cut out letter by letter from a bookand pasted on paper."My dear Prosper" so the epistle ran "a friend who knows the horror ofyour situation sends you this help. There is one heart at least whichfeels for you. Leave France you are yourself. The future is before you.Go and may this money be of use."Enclosed with this note were banknotes for 400. Lecoq disguised as aM. Verduret a country merchant a friend of Bertomy's father securedthis epistle and studied it carefully. His knowledge of the varioustypes used by the printers in Paris showed him that the letters had beentaken from a book printed by a well-known firm who published volumes ofdevotion. The correctness of this conclusion was established by thediscovery on the back of one of the small cuttings the word "Deus." Thewords had been cut from a Catholic prayer-book. To find that prayer-bookwas his next business.In another disguise he sought out Nina Gipsy and by asking herassistance to clear Prosper induced her to take up the position oflady's-maid in the Fauvel family for it was there he conceived themutilated book of devotion would be found. Again his wonderful instinctproved right. In a few days Nina brought him the very book--a prayer-book belonging to Madeline which had been given her by Bertomy.Why had Madeline sent the cashier this elaborately disguised letter Whyhad she wished him to leave France confident as she was so she toldhim of his innocenceTo find an answer to these important queries Lecoq closely questionedBertomy. He learnt that the night before the robbery the cashier haddined with his friend Raoul de Lagors the wealthy dissolute youngnephew of M. Fauvel's wife. This Lagors was the friend of Count Louis deClameran whose demand for the 12000 left him by his dead brother hadresulted in the discovery of the mysterious robbery.Bertomy had nothing but the highest praise for Lagors but on the otherhand spoke most disparagingly of the count. The count it appeared hadproposed for the hand of Madeline and had pressed his suit with greatdetermination. And Madeline--and this was what provided a new problemfor Lecoq's consideration--had tacitly accepted his attention.Through Nina Lecoq had arranged a meeting between Bertomy and Madelineand satisfied himself that the girl was whole-heartedly and devotedly
comment697,attached to her uncle's cashier. Then why was she favouring the suit ofthe count Lecoq at once made it his business to inquire into thecount's past.He was the second son of an old and noble family. His elder brotherGaston having to fly the country in consequence of causing the death ofseveral men he had inherited the property. A life of dissolutepleasures had soon exhausted his patrimony and he was reduced to livingby his wits. Some weeks before the robbery he had discovered that hisbrother Gaston was alive and was living on a large estate in the southof France which he had purchased with the wealth he had accumulated inbusiness. Six weeks after the two brothers met again the elder died andthe younger inherited his vast fortune.Raoul de Lagors was the next character in the drama whose past thedetective made it his business to expose. Lagors it has been said wasthe nephew of Madame Fauvel. To his surprise Lecoq discovered byinquiries in her native place that the banker's wife had never had anybrothers or sisters. Lagors therefore was not her nephew.Fanferlot acting on instructions had kept a strict watch on themovements of Madeline and by this means Lecoq received timely warningof a mysterious excursion which the girl made one night. He followed herto a lonely house on the outskirts of the city. When she had gainedadmittance the appearance of a light in one of the windows on the firstfloor seemed to indicate the room to which she had been taken. By theaid of a ladder Lecoq was able to watch what was going on withinthrough the shutters.He saw Madeline standing opposite Lagors evidently from her attitudepleading with him. For some time he listened to her with a cynicalsmile upon his face but after an hour he seemed to decide with evidentreluctance to comply with her request. Going to a cabinet he took outa bundle of pawn tickets and flung them on the table. Hastily goingthrough the collection she selected three and concealing them in herdress left the house.By following her to a pawnshop Lecoq discovered that she had redeemedcertain valuable articles of jewelry belonging to Madame Fauvel. Lecoqknew through Nina Gipsy who still filled the part of lady's-maid inthe Fauvel family that M. Fauvel had insisted on his wife accompanyinghim on the following evening to a great fancy-dress ball which was to begiven by one of the wealthiest families in the capital. Obviously thenthe jewelry that Madeline had redeemed was required by Madame Fauvel forthe occasion. Why had she pawned it for LagorsA theory had half formed itself in Lecoq's brain. He determined to proveits truth. Disguised as a clown he attended the fancy-dress ball andin the character of a mountebank collected a group of ladies andgentlemen around him while he related with the inimitable skill of abuffoon a romantic narrative. To most of the people present it wassimply an amusing story but to the count and Lagors and Madame Fauvelwho were among the listeners it seemed something much more for Lecoqdressed out his theory of the robbery in the trappings of romance. Justas he reached the climax of the story there was a cry and Madame Fauvelalmost fell fainting on the floor. The count and Lagors rushed upfuriously to Lecoq."Master Clown" said Lagors "your tongue is too long.""Perhaps my pretty boy" retorted Lecoq "perhaps it is. But it is Ican assure you not so long as my arm.""Who are you M. le Clown" the count exclaimed angrily."I am" replied Lecoq "the best friend your brother Gaston had. I washis counsellor. I am the confidant of his last wishes."
comment698,Though the solution of the problem seemed so tantalisingly near therewere still some threads in the tangle which required sorting out beforeLecoq could say that the case was complete. Among other matters heinquired of Bertomy the word which had been used to lock the safe onthe night of the robbery. The word had been "gipsy." Bertomy wasconfident that he had not mentioned it to anybody but Nina Gipsy wasable to throw light on this part of the problem. She recollected achance remark of Bertomy's while sitting at dinner with herself andLagors on the night of the robbery. She had reproached Bertomy withneglecting her."It's too bad for you to reproach me" cried the cashier "for it isyour name which at this very moment guards the safe of M. Fauvel."Lagors therefore had known the password. What did this new discoveryimply How did it fit in with the rest of the data which Lecoq had sobrilliantly collectedAfter his custom he marshalled once more in his mind all the facts athis disposal but they were like so many loose links in a chain. Theyrequired the connecting link to make the chain complete. To find thatlink Lecoq spent a month in visiting the old home of the De Clameransthe estate formerly occupied by Gaston de Clameron who had died a fewdays before the robbery and also in a trip to England. When he returnedto Paris _dossier_ No. 113 was complete._III.--The Dossier_In her extreme youth Madame Fauvel had been secretly loved by Gaston deClameron. It was a result of certain contemptuous words spoken of thegirl he loved that Gaston had committed those deeds which had compelledhim to fly the country. Shortly after his flight the girl finding thatshe was about to give birth to a child imparted the secret to hermother. Fearing a scandal the mother accompanied by a faithful nursetook her daughter over to England. There near London a child was bornwho was immediately handed over to some simple country people to adopt.The unhappy girl returned to France and shortly after married M.Fauvel the banker.Years after the Count Louis de Clameron who had inherited and ruinedthe estates of which his brother Gaston had been deprived discoveredthis secret from the nurse and finding on inquiries in London that thechild had died persuaded a young ne'er-do-well Englishman to play the_rle_ of his brother's son. He secretly introduced him to MadameFauvel and through this means obtained what money he required from theunhappy woman who feared the discovery of her past secret by herhusband. The situation was complicated by the count falling in love withMadeline and the sudden appearance of Gaston de Clameron who wasthought to be dead.The count poisoned his brother and then finding that Madeline refusedto give up Bertomy determined to accomplish the cashier's ruin and atthe same time obtain an amount of money large enough to buy off hisfellow-conspirator Lagors. Lagors having learnt by chance the passwordthat guarded the safe was sent to Madame Fauvel late at night with arequest for money.At this time Madame Fauvel was at the end of her resources. Lagorssuggested taking the money from the safe. Tom between a desire to helpher supposed son and the risk of discovery she at last consented.Taking M. Fauvel's key they descended silently to the safe-room. At thelast moment just as the key was in the lock Madame Fauvel attempted todeter Lagors from his purpose. In the struggle that scratch was made onthe door which formed the basis of Lecoq's inquiries and enabled thegreat detective to unravel the mystery.Madeline who all the while half guessed at the truth and perceived
comment699,without being told that Madame Fauvel was at the mercy of the count hadbeen prepared to sacrifice her future happiness in order to prevent thescandal being made public.M. Lecoq armed with these facts sought out Lagors. He arrived only intime to prevent a tragedy. Warned by an anonymous letter that his wifehad pawned her diamonds for the benefit of Lagors the banker came uponthem when they were together in Lagor's rooms. Imagining the young manwas his wife's lover the banker drew a revolver and fired four times.Fortunately none of the shots took effect and before he could fireagain Lecoq had rushed into the room and torn the weapon from his grasp.It was the moment of the great detective's triumph. With the dramaticskill of which he was a master he laid bare the whole story anddisclosed the true identity of Raoul Lagors. Before he left he compelledLagors to refund the 12000 he had stolen and in order to avoid ascandal allowed the young man to go free. Then that nothing should bewanting to his triumph he obtained the consent of the banker toBertomy's marriage with Madeline.Hurrying from the banker's house Lecoq hastened to effect the arrest ofthe count. He arrived too late. Realising that he was hopelessly in thetoils the count was bereft of his senses and become a hopeless maniac.Four days later M. Lecoq the official M. Lecoq awaited the arrival ofNina Gipsy and Prosper Bertomy. They declared that they had come to meetM. Verduret who had saved Prosper Bertomy. The detective retiredpromising to summon the man they had come to see. A quarter of an hourlater M. Verduret entered the room. Facing them he told them how afriend of his named Caldas had fallen in love with a girl and how thatgirl had been won from him by a man who cared nothing for her."Caldas determined to revenge himself in his own way. It was his handthat saved the man on the very verge of disgrace. I see you know thatyou Nina are the woman and you Prosper the man while Caldasis...."With a quick gesture he removed his wig and whiskers and the true Lecoqappeared."Caldas" cried Nina."No not Caldas not Verduret but Lecoq the detective."After the moments of amazement had passed Lecoq turned to leave theroom but Nina barred the way."Caldas" she cried "have you not punished me enough Caldas...."Prosper went from the office alone.                                   JOHN GALTAnnals of the Parish     John Gait poet dramatist historian and novelist was born     at Irvine Ayrshire Scotland on May 2 1779. He was trained     for a commercial career in the Greenock Custom House and in     the office of a merchant in that seaport. Removing to London     Gait engaged in business and afterwards travelled extensively     to forward mercantile enterprises in all the countries     bordering on the Mediterranean and the Near East where he     repeatedly met Lord Byron. His first work of fiction was a     Sicilian story published in 1816 but it was not until 1820     that he found his true literary expression when the "Ayrshire     Legatees" appeared in "Blackwood's Magazine." The success of     this tale was so great that Gait finished the "Annals of the     Parish or the Chronicle of Dalmailing during the Ministry of     the Rev. Micah Balwhidder" which he had really begun in 1813     and they were published in 1821. The "Annals" contain a lively
comment700,     and humorous picture of Scottish character manners and     feeling during the era described. In the latter part of his     life Gait wrote several novels a life of Byron an     autobiography and his "Literary Life and Miscellanies." He     died on April 11 1838._I.--The Placing of Mr. Balwhidder_The year A.D. 1760 was remarkable for three things in the parish ofDalmailing. First and foremost there was my placing then the coming ofMrs. Malcolm with her five children to settle among us and next mymarriage with my own cousin Miss Betty Lanshaw. The placing was a greataffair for I was put in by the patron and the people knew nothing ofme whatsoever. They were really mad and vicious insomuch that there wasobliged to be a guard of soldiers to protect the presbytery. Dirt wasflung upon us as we passed and the finger of scorn held out to me. ButI endured it with a resigned spirit compassionating their wilfulnessand blindness.The kirk door was nailed up and we were obligated to go in by thewindow making the Lord's house like an inn on a fair-day with theirgrievous yelly hooing. Thomas Thorl the weaver a pious zealot got upat the time of the induction and protested and said "Verily verily Isay unto you he that entereth not by the door of the sheepfold butclimbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber."When the laying on of the hands upon me was adoing Mr. Given ministerof Lugton a jocose man who could not get near stretched out his staffand touched my head saying to the great diversion of the rest "Thiswill do well enough--timber to timber."After the ceremony we went to the manse and there had an excellentdinner. Although my people received me in this unruly manner I wasresolved to cultivate civility among them and next morning I began around of visitations. But oh it was a steep brae to climb. The doorsin some places were barred against me in others the bairns ran cryingto their mothers "Here's the feckless Mess-John." But Thomas Thorlreceived me kindly and said that this early visitation was a symptom ofgrace and that not to condemn me without trial he and some neighbourswould be at the kirk at the next Lord's day so that I would not have topreach just to the bare walls and the laird's family.
comment701,As to Mrs. Malcolm she was the widow of a Clyde shipmaster that waslost at sea with his vessel. A genty body she never changed her widow'sweeds and span frae morning tae nicht to keep her bairns and herself.When her daughter Effie was ill I called on her in a sympathising wayand offered her some assistance frae the Session but she refused helpout of the poor's-box as it might be hereafter cast up to her bairns.It was in the year 1761 that the great smuggling trade corrupted thewest coast. Tea was going like chaff and brandy like well-water. Therewas nothing minded but the riding of cadgers by day and excisemen bynight and battles between the smugglers and the king's men both by seaand land continual drunkenness and debauchery and our Session had anawful time o't.I did all that was in my power to keep my people from the contagion. Ipreached sixteen times from the text "Render to Caesar the things thatare Caesar's." I visited exhorted warned and prophesied but the evilgot in among us. The third year of my ministry was long held inremembrance. The small-pox came in among the poor bits o' weans of theparish and the smashing it made among them was woeful. When thepestilence was raging I preached a sermon about Rachel weeping for herchildren which Thomas Thorl a great judge of good preaching said"was a monument of divinity whilk searched the heart of many a parentthat day"--a thing I was well pleased to hear and was minded to makehim an elder the next vacancy. But worthy man it was not permitted himto arrive at that honour for that fall it pleased Him that alone cangive and take to pluck him from this life.In this year Charlie Malcolm Mrs. Malcolm's eldest son was sent to seain a tobacco-trader that sailed between Port Glasgow and Virginia.Tea-drinking was beginning to spread more openly in so much that by theadvice of the first Mrs. Balwhidder Mrs. Malcolm took in tea to sell toeke out something to the small profits of her wheel. I lost some of mydislike to the tea after that and we had it for breakfast at the manseas well as in the afternoon. But what I thought most of it for was thatit did no harm to the head of the drinkers which was not always thecase with the possets in fashion before when I remember decent ladiescoming home with red faces from a posset-masking. So I refrained frompreaching against tea henceforth but I never lifted the weight of mydispleasure from off the smuggling trade until it was utterly put downby the strong hand of government._II.--The Minister's Second Marriage_A memorable year both in public and private was 1763. The king grantedpeace to the French. Lady Macadam widow of General Macadam who livedin her jointure-house took Kate Malcolm to live with her as companionand she took pleasure in teaching Kate all her accomplishments and how
comment702,to behave herself like a lady. The lint-mill on Lugton Water was burnedto the ground with not a little of the year's crop of lint in ourparish. The first Mrs. Balwhidder lost upwards of twelve stone whichwas intended for sarking to ourselves and sheets and napery. A greatloss indeed it was and the vexation thereof had a visible effect on herhealth which from the spring had been in a dwining way. But for it Ithink she might have wrestled through the winter. However it wasordered otherwise and she was removed from mine to Abraham's bosom onChristmas Day and buried on Hogmanay for it was thought uncanny tohave a dead corpse in the house on the New Year's Day.Just by way of diversion in my heavy sorrow I got a well-shapenheadstone made for her but a headstone without a epitaph being nobetter than a body without the breath of life in't I made a poesy forthe monument not in the Latin tongue which Mrs. Balwhidder worthywoman as she was did not understand but in sedate language which wasgreatly thought of at the time. My servant lassies having no eye of amistress over them wasted everything at such a rate that long beforethe end of the year the year's stipend was all spent and I did notknow what to do. At lang and length I sent for Mr. Auld a douce anddiscreet elder and told him how I was situated. He advised me for myown sake to look out for another wife as soon as decency would allow.In the following spring I placed my affections with due considerationon Miss Lizzy Kibbock the well-brought-up daughter of Mr. JosephKibbock of the Gorbyholm farmer and we were married on the 29th dayof April on account of the dread we had of being married in May for itis said "Of the marriages in May the bairns die of a decay." Thesecond Mrs. Balwhidder had a genius for management and started a dairyand set the servant lassies to spin wool for making blankets and lintfor sheets and napery. She sent the butter on market days to Irvilleher cheese and huxtry to Glasgow. We were just coining money in so muchthat after the first year we had the whole tot of stipend to put intothe bank.The opening of coal-pits in Douray Moor brought great prosperity to theparish but the coal-carts cut up the roads especially the Vennel anarrow and crooked street in the clachan. Lord Eglesham came down fromLondon in the spring of 1767 to see the new lands he had bought in ourparish. His coach couped in the Vennel and his lordship was thrown headforemost into the mud. He swore like a trooper and said he would get anact of parliament to put down the nuisance. His lordship came to themanse and being in a woeful plight he got the loan of my best suit ofclothes. This made him wonderful jocose both with Mrs. Balwhidder andme for he was a portly man and I but a thin body and it was really
comment703,droll to see his lordship clad in my garments. Out of this accident grewa sort of neighbourliness between Lord Eglesham and me._III.--A Runaway Match_About Christmas Lady Macadam's son having been perfected in the art ofwar at a school in France had with the help of his mother's friendsand his father's fame got a stand of colours in the Royal ScotsRegiment. He came to show himself in his regimentals to his lady motherand during the visit he fell in love and entered into correspondencewith Kate Malcolm. A while after her ladyship's flunkey came to themanse and begged me to go to her. So I went and there she was withgum-flowers on her head sitting on a settee for she was lame and inher hand she held a letter."Sir" she said as I came into the room "I want you to go instantly toyour clerk" meaning Mr. Lorimore the schoolmaster "and tell him Iwill give him a couple of hundred pounds to marry Miss Malcolm withoutdelay.""Softly my lady you must first tell me the meaning of all this hasteof kindness" said I in my calm methodical manner. At which she beganto sob and bewail her ruin and the dishonour of her family. I wasconfounded but at length it came out that she had accidentally opened aletter that had come from London for Kate that she had read it bywhich she came to know that Kate and her darling son were trysted andthat this was not the first love-letter which had passed between them.Mr. Lorimore promptly declined her ladyship's proposal as he wasengaged to be married to his present worthy helpmate. Although herladyship was so overcome with passion she would not part with Kate norallow her to quit the house.Three years later the young Laird Macadam being ordered with hisregiment for America got leave from the king to come and see his ladymother before his departure. But it was not to see her only. He arrivedat a late hour unwarned lest his mother would send Kate out of the waybut no sooner did her ladyship behold his face than she kindled uponboth him and Kate and ordered them out of her sight and house. Theyoung folk had discretion. Kate went home to her mother and the lairdcame to the manse and begged us to take him in.He asked me to perform the ceremony as he was resolved to marry Kate.We stepped over to Mrs. Malcolm's house where we found the saintlywoman with Kate and Erne and Willie preparing to read their Bible forthe night. After speaking to Mrs. Malcolm for a time she consented tothe marriage. It was sanctified by me before we left Mrs. Malcolm's theyoung couple setting off in the laird's chaise to Glasgow andauthorising me to break the matter to Lady Macadam. I was spared thisperformance for the servants jealoused what had been done and told herladyship. When I entered the room she was like a mad woman in Bedlam.She sent her coachman on horseback to overtake them which he did at
comment704,Kilmarnock and they returned in the morning when her ladyship was ascagey and meikle taken up with them as if they had gotten her fullconsent and privilege from the first. Captain Macadam afterwards boughta house at the Braehead and gave it with a judicious income to Mrs.Malcolm telling her it was not becoming that she should any longer bedependent upon her own industry. For this the young man got a name likea sweet odour in all the country-side.It will be remembered that Charlie Malcolm went a-sailing in atobacco-trader to America. When his ship was lying in the harbour ofVirginia a press-gang that was in need of men for the Avengerman-of-war came on board and pressed poor Charles. I wrote to LordEglesham anent the matter and his lordship's brother being connectedwith the Admiralty the captain of the man-of-war was instructed to makea midshipman of Charles. This was done and Mrs. Malcolm heard from timeto time from her son saying that he had found a friend in the captainthat was just a father to him.In the latter end of 1776 the man-of-war with Charles Malcolm in hercame to the Tail of the Bank at Greenock and Charles got leave from hiscaptain to come and see his mother. He brought with him Mr. Howardanother midshipman the son of a great Parliament man in London. Theywere dressed in their fine gold-laced garbs. When Charles had seen hismother and his sister Effie he came with his friend to see me at themanse and got Mrs. Balwhidder to ask his friend to sleep there. Inshort we had a ploy the whole two days they stayed with us LadyMacadam made for them at a ball and it was a delight to see how old andyoung of all degrees made much of Charles._IV.--Years of Lamentation_I was named in the year 1779 for the General Assembly and Mrs.Balwhidder by her continual thrift having made our purse able to standa shake against the wind we resolved to go into Edinburgh in acreditable manner. We put up at Widow M'Vicar's a relation to my firstwife a gawsy furthy woman taking great pleasure in hospitality. Inshort everybody in Edinburgh was in a manner wearisome kind.I was delighted and surprised to find Lord Eglesham at the levee and heintroduced me to his grace the Commissioner who required me to preachbefore him. Fain would I have eschewed the honour that was thus thrustupon me but both my wife and Mrs. M'Vicar were just lifted out ofthemselves at the thought. After the sermon the Commissionercomplimented me on my apostolic earnestness and Mrs. M'Vicar said I hadsurprised everybody but I was fearful there was something of jocularityat the bottom of all this.
comment705,The year 1781 was one of dolour and tribulation for Lord Eglesham wasshot dead by a poaching exciseman and Lady Macadam died of paralysisbut the year after was one of greater lamentation. Three brave youngfellows belonging to the clachan who had gone as soldiers in Americawere killed in battle with the rebels for which there was great grief.Shortly after this the news came of a victory over the French fleet andby the same post I got a letter from Mr. Howard the midshipman tellingme that poor Charles had been mortally wounded in the action and hadafterwards died of his wounds.Mrs. Malcolm heard the news of the victory through the steeple hellbeing set a-ringing and she came over to the manse in great anxiety.When I saw her I could not speak but looked at her in pity and thetears fleeing into my eyes she guessed what had happened. After givinga deep and sore sigh she inquired "How did he behave I hope well forhe was aye a gallant laddie" And then she wept very bitterly. I gaveher the letter which she begged me to give to her to keep saying"It's all that I have left now of my pretty boy but it is mair preciousto me than the wealth of the Indies"_V.--Death of the Second Mrs. Balwhidder_Some time after this a Mr. Cayenne a man of crusty temper but goodheart and his family American loyalists settled among us. In the year1788 a proposal came from Glasgow to build a cotton mill on the banksof the Brawl burn a rapid stream which ran through the parish. Mr.Cayenne took a part in the profit or loss of the concern and the cottonmill and a new town was built and the whole called Cayenneville.Weavers of muslin were brought to the mill and women to teach thelassie bairns in our old clachan tambouring instead of hand-spinning.Prosperity of fortune is like the golden hue of the evening cloud thatdelighteth the spirit and passeth away. In the month of February 1796my second wife was gathered to the Lord. Her death was to me a greatsorrow for she was a most excellent wife industrious to a degree. Withher I had grown richer than any other minister in the presbytery.I laid her by the side of my first love Betty Lanshaw and I inscribedher name upon the same headstone. Time had drained my poetical vein andI have not yet been able to indite an epithet on her merits and virtuesfor she had an eminent share of both. Above all she was the mother ofmy children. She was not long deposited in her place of rest untilthings fell into amazing confusion and I saw it would be necessary assoon as decency would allow for me to take another wife both for ahelpmate and to tend me in my approaching infirmities.I saw it would not do for me to look out for an overly young woman noryet would it do for one of my way to take an elderly maiden ladies of
comment706,that sort being liable to possess strong-set particularities. Itherefore resolved that my choice should lie among widows of a discreetage and I fixed my purpose on Mrs. Nugent the relict of a professor inthe University of Glasgow both because she was a well-bred womanwithout any children and because she was held in great estimation as alady of Christian principle. And so we were married as soon as atwelve-month and a day had passed from the death of the second Mrs.Balwhidder and neither of us have had occasion to rue the bargain._VI.--The Last Sermon_Two things made 1799 a memorable year the marriage of my daughter Janetwith the Rev. Dr. Kittleword of Swappington a match in every waycommendable and the death of Mrs. Malcolm. If ever there was a saint onearth she was surely one. She bore adversity with an honest pride shetoiled in the day of penury and affliction with thankfulness for herlittle earnings.The year 1803 saw tempestuous times. Bonaparte gathered his host fornentthe English coast and the government at London were in terror of theirlives for an invasion. All in the country saw that there was danger andI was not backward in sounding the trumpet to battle. I delivered onLord's Day a religious and political exhortation on the present postureof public affairs before a vast congregation of all ranks. The weekfollowing there were meetings of weavers and others and volunteers wereenrolled in defence of king and country.In the course of the next four or five years many changes took place inthe parish. The weavers and cotton-mill folk and seceders from my ownkirk built a meeting-house in Cayenneville where there had been for awhile great suffering on account of the failure of the cotton-millcompany. In the year 1809 the elders came in a body to the manse andsaid that seeing that I was now growing old they thought they couldnot testify their respect for me in a better manner than by agreeing toget me a helper and the next year several young ministers spared mefrom the necessity of preaching.When it was known that I was to preach my last sermon on the lastsabbath of 1810 everyone including the seceders to the meeting-housemade it a point to be in the parish kirk or to stand in the crowd thatmade a lane of reverence for me to pass from the kirk door to theback-yett of the manse. It was a moving discourse and there were fewdry eyes in the kirk that day for my bidding them farewell was as whenof old among the heathen an idol was taken away by the hand of the
comment707,enemy. Shortly after a deputation of the seceders with their ministerat their head came to me and presented a server of silver in token oftheir esteem of my blameless life and the charity I had practisedtowards the poor.I am thankful that I have been spared with a sound mind to write thisbook to the end having really no more to say saving only to wish ablessing on all people from on high where I soon hope to be and tomeet there all the old and long-departed sheep of my flock especiallythe first and second Mrs. Balwhidders.                                   ELIZABETH CLEGHORN GASKELLCranford     Mrs. Gaskell whose maiden name was Elizabeth C. Stevenson     was born in Chelsea London Sept. 29 1810. She married a     Unitarian clergyman in Manchester. Her first literary work was     published anonymously and met with a storm of mingled     approval and disapproval. Charles Dickens invited her to     contribute to his "Household Words" and it was in the pages     of that famous periodical at intervals between December 13     1851 and May 21 1853 that her charming sketches of social     life in a little country town first appeared. In June 1853     they were grouped together under the title of "Cranford"     meeting with wide approval and have long taken rank as one of     the accepted English classics. The town which figures here as     Cranford is understood to have been Knutsford in Cheshire     which still retains something of that old-world feeling and     restfulness which Mrs. Gaskell embodied in the pages of her     most engaging book. "Cranford" is probably the direct     progenitor of many latter-day books of the class to which the     word "idyll" has been somewhat loosely applied. Its charm and     freshness are unfading it remains unique and unrivalled as a     sympathetic and kindly humorous description of English     provincial life. Mrs. Gaskell died in November 1865._I.--Our Society_On the first visit I paid to Cranford after I had left it as aresidence I was astonished to find a man had settled there--a CaptainBrown. In my time Cranford was in possession of the Amazons. If amarried couple came to settle there somehow the man always disappeared.Either he was fairly frightened to death by being the only man at theevening parties or he was accounted for by being with his regiment hisship or closely connected in business all the week in the greatneighbouring commercial town of Drumble distant only twenty miles onthe railroad.I was naturally interested to learn what opinions Captain Brown hadmanaged to win for himself in Cranford. So with all the delicacy whichthe subject demanded I made inquiries of my hostess Miss Jenkyns. I
comment708,was surprised to learn that Captain Brown not only was respected buthad even gained an extraordinary place of authority among the Cranfordladies. Of course he had been forced to overcome great difficulties.In the first place the ladies of Cranford had moaned over the invasionof their territories by a man and a gentleman. Then Captain Brown hadstarted badly very badly by openly referring to his poverty. If he hadwhispered it to an intimate friend the doors and windows beingpreviously closed his vulgarity--a tremendous word in Cranford--mighthave been forgiven. But he had published his poverty in the publicstreet in a loud military voice alleging it as a reason for not takinga particular house.In Cranford too where it was tacitly agreed to ignore that anyone withwhom we associated on terms of equality could ever be prevented bypoverty from doing anything they wished. Where if we walked to and froma party it was because the night was _so_ fine or the air _so_refreshing not because sedan-chairs were so expensive.So the poor captain had been sent to Coventry. The ladies of Cranfordhad frozen him out until the day when the cow an Alderney cow hadbroken the ice.It happened like this. Miss Betsy Barker had an Alderney cow which shelooked upon as a daughter. You could not pay the regulation shortquarter of an hour's call--to stay longer was a breach ofmanners--without being told of the wonderful milk or wonderfulintelligence of this animal. The whole town knew and kindly regardedMiss Betsy Barker's Alderney.One day the cow fell into a lime-pit and Cranford grieved over thespectacle of the poor beast being drawn out having lost most of herhair and looking naked cold and miserable in a bare skin. Miss BetsyBarker absolutely cried with sorrow and dismay and was about to preparea bath of oil for the sufferer when Captain Brown called out "Get hera flannel waistcoat and flannel drawers ma'am if you wish to keep heralive. But my advice is 'kill the poor creature at once.'" Miss BetsyBarker dried her eyes and in a few hours the whole town turned out tosee the Alderney meekly going to her pasture clad in dark-gray flannel.Do you ever see cows dressed in gray flannel in LondonOn that day was born the respect of the Cranford ladies for CaptainBrown.Soon after my arrival in Cranford Miss Jenkyns gave a party in myhonour and recalling the old days when we had almost persuadedourselves that to be a man was to be "vulgar" I was curious to see whatthe ladies would do with Captain Brown.The preparations were much as usual. Card-tables with green baize topswere set out by daylight and towards four when the evening closed inwe all stood dressed in our best each with a candle-lighter in ourhand ready to dart at the candles as soon as the first knock came. Thechina was delicate egg-shell the old-fashioned silver glittered withpolishing but the eatables were of the slightest description. While the
comment709,trays were yet on the table Captain Brown arrived with his twodaughters Miss Brown and Miss Jessie the former with a sickly painedand careworn expression the latter with a pretty round dimpled faceand the look of a child which will remain with her should she live to bea hundred.I could see that the captain was a favourite with all the ladiespresent. Ruffled brows were smoothed and sharp voices hushed at hisapproach. He immediately and quietly assumed the man's place in theroom attended to everyone's wants lessened the pretty maidservant'slabour by waiting on empty cups and bread-and-butterless ladies and yetdid it all in so easy and dignified a manner and so much as if it werea matter of course for the strong to attend to the weak that he was atrue man throughout.The party passed off very well in spite of one or two little hitches.One was Miss Jessie Brown's unguarded admission--_ propos_ of Shetlandwool--that she had an uncle her mother's brother who was a shopkeeperin Edinburgh. Miss Jenkyns tried to drown this confession by a terriblecough for the honourable Mrs. Jamieson was sitting at the card-tablenearest Miss Jessie and what would she say or think if she found outshe was in the same room with a shopkeeper's nieceThen there was a slight breeze between Miss Jenkyns and Captain Brownover the relative merits of Dr. Johnson and the author of "PickwickPapers"--then being published in parts--as writers of light andagreeable fiction. Captain Brown read an account of the "Swarry" whichSam Weller gave at Bath. Some of us laughed very heartily. _I_ did notdare because I was staying in the house. At the conclusion Miss Jenkynssaid to me with mild dignity "Fetch me 'Rasselas' my dear out of thebook-room."After delivering one of the conversations between Rasselas and Imlac ina majestic high-pitched voice Miss Jenkyns said "I imagine I am nowjustified in my preference for Dr. Johnson over your Mr. Boz as a writerof fiction."The captain said nothing merely screwed his lips up and drummed on thetable but when Miss Jenkyns returned later to the charge andrecommended the doctor's style to Captain Brown's favourite the captainreplied "I should be very sorry for him to exchange his style for anysuch pompous writing."Miss Jenkyns felt this as a personal affront in a way of which thecaptain had not dreamed. How could he know that she and her friendslooked upon epistolary writing as their forte and that when in a letterthey "seized the half-hour just previous to post-time to assure" theirfriends of this and that they were using the doctor as a modelAs it was Miss Jenkyns refused to be mollified by Captain Brown'sefforts later to beguile her into conversation on some more pleasingsubject. She was inexorable.Captain Brown endeavoured to make peace after this memorable dispute bya present to Miss Jenkyns of a wooden fire-shovel his own makinghaving heard her say how much the grating of an iron one annoyed her.She received the present with cool gratitude and thanked him formally.When he was gone she bade me put it in the lumber-room feeling probablythat no present from a man who preferred Mr. Boz to Dr. Johnson could beless jarring than an iron fire-shovel.Such was the state of affairs at the time when I left Cranford and wentto Drumble. I had however several correspondents who kept me _au fait_as to the proceedings of the inhabitants of the dear little town._II.--The Captain_
comment710,My next visit to Cranford was in the summer. There had been neitherbirths deaths nor marriages since I was there last. Everybody lived inthe same house and wore pretty near the same well-preservedold-fashioned clothes. The greatest event was that the Misses Jenkynshad purchased a new carpet for the drawing-room. Oh the busy work MissMatty and I had in chasing the sunbeams as they fell in an afternoonright down on this carpet through the blindless windows We spread ournewspapers over the places and sat down to our book or our work andlo in a quarter of an hour the sun had moved and was blazing away in afresh spot and down again we went on our knees to alter the position ofthe newspapers. One whole morning too we spent in cutting out andstitching together pieces of newspapers so as to form little paths toevery chair lest the shoes of visitors should defile the purity of thecarpet. Do you make paper paths for every guest to walk upon in LondonThe literary dispute between Captain Brown and Miss Jenkyns continued.She had formed a habit of talking _at_ him. And he retaliated bydrumming his fingers which action Miss Jenkyns felt and resented asdisparaging to Dr. Johnson.The poor captain I noticed on this visit that he looked older and moreworn and his clothes were very threadbare. But he seemed as bright andcheerful as ever unless he was asked about his daughter's health.One afternoon we perceived little groups in the street all listeningwith faces aghast to some tale or other. It was some time before MissJenkyns took the undignified step of sending Jenny out to inquire.Jenny came back with a white face of terror."Oh ma'am Oh Miss Jenkyns ma'am Captain Brown is killed by themnasty cruel railroads." And she burst into tears."How where--where Good God Jenny don't waste time in crying buttell us something."Miss Matty rushed out into the street and presently an affrightedcarter appeared in the drawing-room and told the story."'Tis true mum I seed it myself. The captain was a-readin' some bookwaitin' for the down train when a lass as gave its sister the slip cametoddling across the line. He looked up sudden see'd the child dartedon the line cotched it up and his foot slipped and the train came overhim in no time. The child's safe. Poor captain would be glad of thatmum wouldn't he God bless him"The great rough carter turned away to hide his tears. I turned to MissJenkyns. She looked very ill as though she were going to faint andsigned to me to open a window."Matilda bring me my bonnet. I must go to those girls. God pardon me ifever I have spoken contemptuously to the captain."Miss Brown did not long survive her father. Her last words were a prayerfor forgiveness for her selfishness in allowing her sister Jessie tosacrifice herself for her all her life.But Miss Jessie was not long left alone. Miss Jenkyns insisted sheshould come and stay with her and would not hear of her going out intothe world to earn her living as a saleswoman. "Some people have no ideaof their rank as a captain's daughter" she related indignantly andstumped out of the room. Presently she came back with a strange look onher face."I have been much startled--no I've not been startled--don't mind memy dear Miss Jessie only surprised--in fact I've had a caller whom youonce knew my dear Miss Jessie."Miss Jessie went very white then flushed scarlet."Is it--it is not----" stammered out Miss Jessie and got no farther."This is his card" said Miss Jenkyns and went through a series ofwinks and odd faces at me and formed a long sentence with her lips ofwhich I could not understand a word.Major Gordon was shown upstairs.While downstairs Miss Jenkyns told me what the major had told her. Howhe had served in the same regiment as Captain Brown and had fallen inlove with Miss Jessie then a sweet-looking blooming girl of eighteen
comment711,how she had refused him though obviously not indifferent to him how hehad discovered the obstacle to be the fell disease which had strickenher sister whom there was no one to nurse and comfort but herself howhe had believed her cold and had left in anger and finally how he hadread of the death of Captain Brown in a foreign newspaper.Just then Miss Matty burst into the room."Oh Deborah" she said "there's a gentleman sitting in the drawing-room with his arm round Miss Jessie's waist""The most proper place for his arm to be in. Go Matilda and mind yourown business."Poor Miss Matty This was a shock coming from her decorous sister.Thus happiness and with it some of her early bloom returned to MissJessie and as Mrs. Gordon her dimples were not out of place._III.--Poor Peter_My visits to Cranford continued for many years and did not cease evenafter the death of Miss Jenkyns.Miss Matty became my new hostess. At first I rather dreaded the changedaspect of things. Miss Matty too began to cry as soon as she saw me.She was evidently nervous from having anticipated my visit. I comfortedher as well as I could and I found the best consolation I could givewas the honest praise that came from my heart as I spoke of thedeceased.Miss Matty made me her confidante in many matters and one evening shesent Martha to go for eggs at a farm at the other end of the town andtold me the story of her brother."Poor Peter The sole honour he brought from Shrewsbury was thereputation of being captain of the school in the art of practicaljoking. He even thought that the people of Cranford might be hoaxed.'Hoaxing' is not a pretty word my dear and I hope you won't tell yourfather I used it for I should not like him to think I was not choice inmy language after living with such a woman as Deborah. I don't know howit slipped out of my mouth except it was that I was thinking of poorPeter and it was always his expression."One day my father had gone to see some sick people in the village.Deborah too was away from home for a fortnight or so. I don't knowwhat possessed poor Peter but he went to her room and dressed himselfin her old gown and shawl and bonnet. And he made the pillow into alittle--you are sure you locked the door my dear--into--into a littlebaby with white long clothes. And he went and walked up and down in theFilbert Walk--just half hidden by the rails and half seen and hecuddled the pillow just like a baby and talked to it all the nonsensepeople do. Oh dear and my father came stepping stately up the streetas he always did and pushing past the crowd saw--I don't know what hesaw--but old Clare said his face went grey-white with anger. He seizedhold of poor Peter tore the clothes off his back--bonnet shawl gownand all--threw them among the crowd and before all the people lifted uphis cane and flogged Peter."My dear that boy's trick on that sunny day when all promised so wellbroke my mother's heart and changed my father for life. Old Clare saidPeter looked as white as my father and stood still as a statue to beflogged."'Have you done enough sir' he asked hoarsely when my father stopped.Then Peter bowed grandly to the people outside the railing and walkedslowly home. He went straight to his mother looking as haughty as anyman and not like a boy."'Mother' he said 'I am come to say "God bless you for ever."'"He would say no more and by the time my mother had found out what hadhappened from my father and had gone to her boy's room to comfort himhe had gone and did not come back. That spring day was the last time heever saw his mother's face. He wrote a passionate entreaty to her to
comment712,come and see him before his ship left the Mersey for the war but theletter was delayed and when she arrived it was too late. It killed mymother. And think my dear the day after her death--for she did notlive a twelve-month after Peter left--came a parcel from India from herpoor boy. It was a large soft white India shawl. Just what my motherwould have liked."We took it to my father in the hopes it would rouse him for he had satwith her hand in his all night long. At first he took no notice of it.Then suddenly he got up and spoke. 'She shall be buried in it' he said.'Peter shall have that comfort and she would have liked it.'""Did Mr. Peter ever come home""Yes once. He came home a lieutenant. And he and my father were suchfriends. My father was so proud to show him to all the neighbours. Henever walked out without Peter's arm to lean on. And then Peter went tosea again and by-and-by my father died blessing us both and thankingDeborah for all she had been to him. And our circumstances were changedand from a big rectory with three servants we had come down to a smallhouse with a servant-of-all-work. But as Deborah used to say we havealways lived genteelly even if circumstances have compelled us tosimplicity. Poor Deborah""And Mr. Peter" I asked."Oh there was some great war in India and we have never heard of Petersince then. I believe he is dead myself. Sometimes when I sit by myselfand the house is quiet I think I hear his step coming up the streetand my heart begins to flutter and beat but the sound goes and Peternever comes back."_IV.--Friends in Need_The years rolled on. I spent my time between Drumble and Cranford. I wasthankful that I happened to be staying with Miss Matty when the Town andCounty Bank failed which had such a disastrous effect on her littlefortune.It was an example to me and I fancy it might be to many others to seehow immediately Miss Matty set about the retrenchment she knew to beright under her altered circumstances. I did the little I could. Somemonths back a conjuror had given a performance in the Cranford AssemblyRooms. By a strange set of circumstances the identity of Signor Brunoniwas revealed. He was plain Samuel Brown who had fallen out of his cartand had to be attended by our doctor. I went to visit the patient andhis wife and learned that she had been India. She told me a long storyabout being befriended after a perilous journey by a kind Englishmanwho lived right in the midst of the natives. It was his name whichastonished me. Agra Jenkyns.Could Agra Jenkyns be the long lost Peter I resolved to say nothing toMiss Matty but got the address from the signor as we still called himfrom habit spelt by sound and very queer it looked and posted a
comment713,letter to him.All sorts of plans were discussed for Miss Matty's future. I thought ofall the things by which a woman past middle age and with the educationcommon to ladies fifty years ago could earn or add to a living withoutmaterially losing caste but at length I put even this last clause onone side and wondered what in the world Miss Matty could do. Eventeaching was out of the question for reckoning over heraccomplishments I had to come down to reading writing andarithmetic--and in reading the chapter every morning she always coughedbefore coming to long words.I was still in a quandary the next morning when I received a letterfrom Miss Pole so mysteriously wrapped up and with so many seals on itto secure secrecy that I had to tear the paper before I could unfold it.It summoned me to go to Miss Pole at 11 a.m. the a.m. twice dashedunder as if I were likely to come at eleven at night when all Cranfordwas usually abed and asleep by ten. I went and found Miss Pole dressedin solemn array though there were only Mrs. Forrester crying quietlyand sadly and Mrs. FitzAdam present. Miss Pole was armed with a cardon which I imagine she had written some notes."Miss Smith" she began when I entered I was familiarly known to allCranford as Mary but this was a state occasion "I have conversed inprivate with these ladies on the misfortune which has happened to ourfriend and one and all have agreed that while we have a superfluity itis not only a duty but a pleasure--a true pleasure Mary"--her voicewas rather choked just here and she had to wipe her spectacles beforeshe could go on--"to give what we can to assist her--Miss MatildaJenkyns. Only in consideration of the feelings of delicate independenceexisting in the mind of every refined female"--I was sure she had gotback to the card--"we wish to contribute our mites in a secret andconcealed manner so as not to hurt the feelings I have referred to."Well the upshot of this solemn meeting was that each of those dear oldladies wrote down the sum she could afford annually signed the paperand sealed it mysteriously and I was commissioned to get my father toadminister the fund in such a manner that Miss Jenkyns should imaginethe money came from her own improved investments.As I was going Mrs. Forrester took me aside and in the manner of oneconfessing a great crime the poor old lady told me how very very littleshe had to live on--a confession she was brought to make from a dreadlest we should think that the small contribution named in her paper boreany proportion to her love and regard for Miss Mary. And yet that sumwhich she so eagerly relinquished was in truth more than a twentiethpart of what she had to live on. And when the whole income does notnearly amount to a hundred pounds to give up a twentieth of it will
comment714,necessitate many careful economies and many pieces of self-denial--smalland insignificant in the world's account but bearing a different valuein another account book that I have heard of.The upshot of it all was that dear Miss Matty was comfortably installedin her own house and added to her slender income by selling tea Thislast was my idea and it was a proud moment for me when it realized. Thesmall dining-room was converted into a shop without any of itsdegrading characteristics a table formed the counter one window wasretained unaltered and the other changed into a glass door and thereshe was. Tea was certainly a happy commodity as it was neither greasynor sticky grease and stickiness being two of the qualities which MissMatty could not endure. Moreover as Miss Matty said one good thingabout it was that men did not buy it and it was of men particularly shewas afraid. They had such sharp loud ways with them and did upaccounts and counted their change so quickly.Very little remains to be told. The approval of the Honourable Mrs.Jamieson set the seal upon the successful career of Miss Matty as apurveyor of tea. Thus did she escape even the shadow of "vulgarity."One afternoon I was sitting in the shop parlour with Miss Matty when wesaw a gentleman go slowly past the window and then stand opposite to thedoor as if looking out for the name which we had so carefully hidden.His clothes had an out-of-the-way foreign cut and it flashed across meit was the Agra himself He entered.Miss Matty looked at him and something of tender relaxation in his facestruck home to her heart. She said "It is--oh sir can you be Peter"and trembled from head to foot. In a moment he had her in his armssobbing the tearless cries of old age.                                   Mary Barton     "Mary Barton" although not Mrs. Gaskell's first attempt at     authorship was her first literary success and although her     later writings revealed a gain in skill subtlety and humour     none of them equalled "Mary Barton" in dramatic intensity and     fervent sincerity. This passionate tale of the sorrows of the     Manchester poor given to the world anonymously in the year     1848 was greeted with a storm of mingled approval and     disapproval. It was praised by Carlyle and Landor but some     critics attacked it fiercely as a slander on the Manchester     manufacturers and there were admirers who complained that it     was too heartrending. The controversy has long since died     down but the book holds a permanent place in literature as a     vivid revelation of a dark and painful phase of English life     in the middle of the last century._I.--Rich and Poor_"Mary" said John Barton to his daughter "what's come o'er thee and JemWilson You were great friends at one time.""Oh folk say he is going to be married to Molly Gibson" answered Maryas indifferently as she could."Thou'st played thy cards badly then" replied her father in a surlytone. "At one time he were much fonder o' thee than thou deservedst.""That's as people think" said Mary pertly for she remembered that thevery morning before when on her way to her dressmaking work she hadmet Mr. Harry Carson who had sighed and sworn and protested all mannerof tender vows. Mr. Harry Carson was the son and the idol of old Mr.Carson the wealthy mill-owner. Jem Wilson her old playmate and the
comment715,son of her father's closest friend although he had earned a positionof trust at the foundry where he worked was but a mechanic after allMary was ambitious she knew that she had beauty she believed that whenyoung Mr. Carson declared he meant to marry her he spoke the truth.It so happened that Jem after much anxious thought had determined thatday to "put his fortune to the touch." Just after John Barton had goneout Jem appeared at the door looking more awkward and abashed than hehad ever done before.He thought he had better begin at once."Mary it's no new story I'm going to speak about. Since we were boy andgirl I ha' loved you above father and mother and all. And now Mary I'mforeman at the works and I've a home to offer you and a heart as trueas ever man had to love you and cherish you. Darling say that you'll bemine."Mary could not speak at once."Mary they say silence gives consent" he whispered."No not with me I can never be your wife.""Oh Mary think awhile" he urged."Jem it cannot be" she said calmly although she trembled from head tofoot. "Once for all I will never marry you.""And this is the end" he cried passionately. "Mary you'll hear maybeof me as a drunkard and maybe as a thief and maybe as a murderer.Remember it's your cruelty that will have made me what I feel I shallbecome."He rushed out of the house.When he had gone Mary lay half across the dresser her head hidden inher hands and her body shaken with violent sobs. For these few minuteshad unveiled her heart to her it had convinced her that she loved Jemabove all persons or things. What were the wealth and prosperity thatMr. Harry Carson might bring to her now that she had suddenly discoveredthe passionate secret of her soulHer first duty she saw was to reject the advances of her rich lover.She avoided him as far as possible and slighted him when he forced hispresence upon her. And how was she to redress the wrong she had done toJem in denying him her heart She took counsel with her friendMargaret Legh. When Mary had first known Margaret and her grandfatherJob Legh--an old man who belonged to the class of Manchester workmen whoare warm and devoted followers of science a man whose home was like awizard's dwelling filled with impaled insects and books andinstruments--Margaret had a secret fear of blindness. The fear had sincebeen realised but she remained the quiet sensible tender-hearted girlshe had been before her great deprivation. She opposed Mary's notion ofwriting a letter to Jem."You must just wait and be patient" she advised "being patient is thehardest work we have to do through life I take it. Waiting is far moredifficult than doing but it's one of God's lessons we must learn one
comment716,way or another."So Mary waited. But Jem took his disappointment as final and her hopesof seeing him were always baffled.John Barton on the night of Jem's proposal had gone to his union. Themembers of the union were all desperate men ready for anything madeready by want. Barton himself was out of work. He had seen much of thebitterness of poverty in Manchester now he was feeling the pinch of ithimself.Ever since the death of his wife whose end had been hastened by thesudden and complete disappearance of her darling sister Esther the wancolourlessness of his face had been intensified his stern enthusiasmonce latent had become visible his heart tenderer than ever towardsthe victims of the misery around him grew harder towards the employerswhom he believed to be the cause of that misery. Trade grew worse butthere was no sign that the masters were suffering they still had theircarriages and their comforts the woe in these terrible years 18391840 and 1841 seemed to fall wholly upon the poor. It is impossibleeven faintly to picture the state of distress which prevailed inManchester at that time. Whole families went through a gradualstarvation John Barton saw them starve saw fathers and mothers andchildren die of low putrid fever in foetid cellars and cursed the richmen who never extended a helping hand to the sufferers."Working folk won't be ground to the dust much longer" he declared."We'n ha' had as much to bear as human nature can bear."Fiercer grew he and more sullen. Darker and darker were the schemes hebrooded over in his desolate home or discussed with others at themeetings of the union. Even Mary did not escape his ill-temper. Once hestruck her. And yet Mary was the one being on earth he devotedly loved.What would he have thought had he known that his daughter had listenedto the voice of an employer's son But he did not know._II.--The Rivals_One night as Jem was leaving the foundry a woman laid her hand uponhis arm. A momentary glance at the faded finery she wore told him theclass to which she belonged and he made an effort to pass on. But shegrasped him firmly."You must listen to me Jem Wilson" she said "for Mary Barton's sake.""And who can you be to know Mary Barton" he exclaimed."Do you remember Esther Mary's aunt"'"Yes I mind her well." He looked into her face. "Why Esther Wherehave ye been this many a year"She answered with fierce earnestness "Where have I been What have Ibeen doing Can you not guess See after Mary and take care she doesnot become like me. As she is loving now so did I love once--one aboveme far."Jem cut her short with his hoarse stern inquiry "Who is this sparkthat Mary loves""It's old Carson's son." Then after a pause she continued "Oh Jem Icharge you with the care of her Her father won't listen to me." Shecried a little at the recollection of John Barton's harsh words when shehad timidly tried to approach him. "It would be better for her to diethan to live to lead such a life as I do""It would be better" said Jem as if thinking aloud. Then he went on.
comment717,"Esther you may trust to my doing all I can for Mary. And now listen.Come home with me. Come to my mother.""God bless you Jem" she replied. "But it is too late now--too late"She rapidly turned away. Jem felt that the great thing was to reach homeand solitude. His heart was filled with jealous anguish. Mary lovedanother She was lost to him for evermore. A frenzied longing for bloodentered his mind as he brooded that night over his loss. But at last thethought of duty brought peace to his soul. If Carson loved Mary Carsonmust marry her. It was Jem's part to speak straightforwardly to Carsonto be unto Mary as a brother.Four days later his opportunity came. He met Carson in an unfrequentedlane."May I speak a word wi' you sir" said Jem respectfully."Certainly my good man" replied Harry Carson."I think sir you're keeping company wi' Mary Barton""Mary Barton Ay that is her name. An arrant flirt the little hussy isbut very pretty.""I will tell you in plain words" said Jem angered "what I have got tosay to you. I'm an old friend of Mary's and her father's and I want toknow if you mean fair by Mary or not.""You will have the kindness to leave us to ourselves" answered Carsoncontemptuously. "No one shall interfere between my little girl and me.Get out of my way Won't you Then I'll make you"He raised his cane and smote the mechanic on his face. An instantafterwards he lay stretched in the muddy road Jem standing over himpanting with rage. Just then a policeman who had been watching themunobserved interfered with expostulations and warnings."If you dare to injure her" shouted Jem as he was dragged away "Iwill wait you where no policeman can step in between. And God shalljudge between us two"                                   The mill-workers had struck against low wages. Five haggard earnest-looking men had presented the workpeople's demands to the assembledmill-owners and the demands had been rejected. None had been fiercer inopposing the delegates none more bitter in mockery of their rags andleanness than the son of old Mr. Carson.That evening starved irritated despairing men gathered to hear thedelegates tell of their failure."It's the masters as has wrought this woe" said John Barton in a lowvoice. "It's the masters as should pay for it. Set me to serve out themasters and see if there's aught I'll stick at"Deeper and darker grew the import of the speeches as the men stoodhoarsely muttering their meaning out with set teeth and livid looks.After a fierce and terrible oath had been sworn a number of pieces ofpaper one of them marked were shuffled in a hat. The gas wasextinguished each drew a paper. The gas was re-lighted. Each examinedhis paper with a countenance as immovable as he could make it. Thenthey went every one his own way.He who had drawn the marked paper had drawn the lot of the assassin. Andno one save God and his own conscience knew who was the appointedmurderer._III.--Murder_Two nights later Barton was to leave for Glasgow whither he was totravel as delegate to entreat assistance for the strikers. "What couldbe the matter with him" thought Mary. He was so restless he seemed sofierce too.Presently he rose and in a short cold manner bade her farewell. Shestood at the door looking after him her eyes blinded with tears. Hewas so strange so cold so hard. Suddenly he came back and took her in
comment718,his arms."God in heaven bless thee Mary"She threw her arms round his neck. He kissed her unlaced her softtwining arms and set off on his errand.When Mary reached the dressmaker's next morning she noticed that thegirls stopped talking. They eyed her then they began to whisper. Atlast one of them asked her if she had heard the news."No What news" she answered."Have you not heard that young Mr. Carson was murdered last night"Mary could not speak but no one who looked at her pale andterror-stricken face could have doubted that she had not heard before ofthe fearful occurrence.She felt throughout the day as if the haunting horror were a nightmarefrom which awakening would relieve her. Everybody was full of the onesubject.In the evening she went to Mrs. Wilson's hoping that at last she mightsee Jem. But here a new and terrible shock awaited her.Mrs. Wilson turned fiercely upon her."And is it thee that dares set foot in this house after what has cometo pass Dost thou know where my son is all through thee""No" quivered out poor Mary."He's lying in prison waiting to take his trial for murdering young Mr.Carson."So indeed it was. At the inquest the policeman who had witnessed thequarrel between the rivals testified to the threats uttered by Jem andthe gun used by the murderer and thrown away by him in his haste toescape had been proved to be Jem's property.Jem an assassin and because of her In the agony of that night Mary sawthe gallows standing black against the burning light which dazzled hershut eyes press on them as she would. She thought she was going madthen Heaven blessed her unawares and she sank to sleep.She was awakened by the coming of a visitor. It was her long-lostunrecognised aunt Esther who had come to her niece bringing her alittle piece of paper compressed into a round shape. It was the paperthat had served as wadding for the murderer's gun. Esther had picked itup while wandering in curiosity about the scene of the murder. There waswriting on the paper and she had brought it to Mary fearing that if itfell into the hands of the police it would provide more evidence againstJem.The paper told Mary everything. It had belonged to John Barton. Jem wasinnocent and her own father was the murderer Jem must be saved andshe must do it for was she not the sole repository of the terriblesecret And how could she prove Jem's innocence without admitting herfather's guiltWhen she could think calmly she realised that she must discover whereJem had been on the Thursday night when the murder had been committed.Tremblingly she went to Mrs. Wilson and learnt what she wanted to know.Jem had walked towards Liverpool with his cousin Will a sailor who hadspent all his money in Manchester and could not afford railway-fare.Will's ship was to sail on Tuesday and on Tuesday Jem was to be triedat the Liverpool assizes.Job Legh engaged a lawyer to defend Jem and Mary prepared to go to
comment719,Liverpool to find the one man whose evidence could save her lover. Ereshe left a policeman brought her a bit of parchment. Her heart misgaveher as she took it she guessed its purport. It was a summons to bearwitness against Jem Wilson at the assizes._IV.--"Not Guilty_"Arrived at Liverpool on Monday after the bewilderment of a railwayjourney--the first she had ever made--Mary found her way to the littlecourt not far from the docks were Jem's sailor cousin lodged."Is Will Wilson here" she asked the landlady."No he is not" replied the woman curtly."Tell me--where he is" asked Mary sickening."He's gone this very morning my poor dear" answered the landladyrelenting at the sight of Mary's obvious distress. "He's sailed mydear--sailed in the John Cropper this very blessed morning"Mary staggered into the house stricken into hopelessness. Yet hope wasnot dead. The landlady's son told her that the John Cropper would bewaiting for high-water to cross the sandbanks at the river's mouth andthat there was a chance that a sailing-boat might overtake the vessel.Mary hurried down to the docks spent every penny she had in hiring aboat and presently was tossing on the water for the first time in herlife alone with two rough men.The boatmen hailed the John Cropper just as the crew were heavinganchor and told their errand. The captain refused with a dreadful oathto stop his ship for anyone whoever swung for it. But Will Wilsonstanding at the stern shouted through his hands "So help me God MaryBarton I'll come back in the pilot-boat time enough to save his life"As the ship receded in the distance Mary asked anxiously when thepilot-boat would be back. The boatmen did not know it might be twelvehours it might be two days. A chance yet remained but she could nolonger hope. When she reached the landing-place faint and pennilessone of the boatmen took her to his home and there she sat sleeplesslyawaiting the dawn of the day of trial.When she entered the witness-box next day the whole court reeled beforeher save two figures only--that of the judge and that of the prisoner.
comment720,Jem sat silent--he had held his peace ever since his arrest--with hisface bowed on his hands.Mary answered a few questions with a sort of wonder at the reality ofthe terrible circumstances in which she was placed."And pray may I ask which was the favoured lover" went on thebarrister.A look of indignation for an instant contracted Mary's brow. She wasaware that Jem had raised his head and was gazing at her. Turningtowards the judge she said steadily "Perhaps I liked Mr. Harry Carsononce but I loved James Wilson beyond what tongue can tell. When heasked me to marry him I was very hard in my answer but he'd not beengone out of my sight above a minute before I knew I loved him--far abovemy life."After these words the prisoner's head was no longer bowed. He stooderect and firm with self-respect in his attitude yet he seemed lost inthought.But Will Wilson did not come and the evidence against Jem grew strongerand stronger. Mary was flushed and anxious muttering to herself in awild restless manner. Job Legh heard her repeat again and again "Imust not go mad I must not"Suddenly she threw up her arms and shrieked aloud "Oh Jem Jem You'resaved and I am mad" and was carried out of court stiff and convulsed.And as they bore her off a sailor forced his way over rails and seatsthrough turnkeys and policemen. Will Wilson had come in time.He told his tale clearly and distinctly the efforts of the prosecutionto shake him were useless. "Not guilty" was the verdict that thrilledthrough the breathless court. One man sank back in his seat in sickeningdespair. The vengeance that old Mr. Carson had longed to compass for themurder of his beloved boy was thwarted he had been cheated of thedesire that now ruled his life--the desire of blood for blood._V.--"Forgive Us Our Trespasses_"For many days Mary hovered between life and death and it was long ereshe could make the journey back to Manchester under the tender care ofthe man who now knew she loved him. Not until she had recovered did hetell her that he had lost his situation at the foundry--the men refusedto work under one who had been tried for murder--and that he was lookingfor work elsewhere."Mary" he asked "art thou much bound to Manchester Would it grievethee sore to quit the old smoke-jack""With thee" was her quiet response."I've heard fine things of Canada. Thou knowest where Canada is Mary""Not rightly--but with thee Jem"--her voice sank to awhisper--"anywhere." Then after a pause she added "But father"John Barton was smitten helpless very near to death. His face was sunkand worn--like a skull with yet a suffering expression that skulls havenot Crime and all had been forgotten by his daughter when she saw himfondly did she serve him in every way that heart could devise.Jem had known from the first that Barton was the murderer of HarryCarson. Several days before the murder Barton had borrowed Jem's gunand Jem had seen the truth at the moment of his arrest. When Mary cameto tell him that her father wished to speak to him Jem could not guesswhat was before him and did not try to guess.When they entered the room Mary saw all at a glance. Her father stoodholding on to a chair as if for support. Behind him sat Job Leghlistening before him stood the stern figure of Mr. Carson."Don't dare to think that I shall be merciful you shall behanged--hanged--man" said Mr. Carson with slow emphasis."I've had far far worse misery than hanging" cried Barton. "Sir oneword My hairs are grey with suffering.""And have I had no suffering" interrupted Mr. Carson. "Is not my boygone--killed--out of my sight for ever He was my sunshine and now itis night Oh my God comfort me comfort me" cried the old man aloud.Barton lay across the table broken-hearted. "God knows I didn't knowwhat I was doing" he whispered. "Oh sir" he said wildly "say youforgive me""Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us"said Job solemnly.Mr. Carson took his hands from his face."Let my trespasses be unforgiven so that I may have vengeance for myson's murder."John Barton lay on the ground as one dead.
comment721,When Mr. Carson had left the house he leant against a railing to steadyhimself for he was dizzy with agitation. He looked up to the calmmajestic depths of the heavens and by-and-by the last words he hadspoken returned upon him as if they were being echoed through all thatinfinite space in tones of unutterable sorrow. He went homewards not tothe police-office. All night long the archangel combated with the demonin his soul.All night long others watched by the bed of death. As morning dawnedBarton grew worse his breathing seemed almost stopped. Jem had gone tothe druggist's and Mary cried out for assistance to raise her father.A step which was not Jem's came up the stairs. Mr. Carson stood in thedoorway. He raised up the powerless frame and the departing soul lookedout of the eyes with gratitude."Pray for us" cried Mary sinking on her knees."God be merciful to us sinners" was Mr. Carson's prayer. "Forgive usour trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us."And when the words were said John Barton lay a corpse in Mr. Carson'sarms.                                   At the door of a long low wooden house stands Mary watching the returnof her husband from his work.Her baby boy in his grandmother's arms sees him come with a crow ofdelight."English letters" cries Jem.

WILLIAM GODWINCaleb Williams     William Godwin the son of a dissenting parson was a man of     remarkable gifts and the father of the poet Shelley's second     wife Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley see Vol. VII. Born at     Wisbeach England March 3 1756 he served for five years     1778-83 as a Nonconformist minister and then going to     London joined the leading Whig circle of the day and turned     his attention to political writings. His "Political Justice"     though little read to-day had a great number of readers and     considerable influence a hundred years ago. "Things as They     Are or the Adventures of Caleb Williams" published in 1794     has a philosophical significance suggested by the falseness     of the common code of morality which is apt to be overlooked     by many readers in the strong interest of the tale. It is one     of the few books of that period which may still be said to     live. It is quite the best of his novels. "It raised Godwin's     reputation to a pinnacle" according to contemporary     criticism though some of his other novels notably     "Fleetwood" have been preferred for their descriptive     writing. He was an exceedingly industrious writer essays     biography political philosophy and history all coming from     his pen but in spite of this and of his many distinguished     friendships Godwin was always in difficulties which he bore     with the becoming grace of a philosopher. He died on April 7     1836._I.--Mr. Falkland's Secret_My life has for several years been a theatre of calamity. My fairestprospects have been blasted. My enemy has shown himself inaccessible toentreaties and untired in persecution. I was born of humble parents ina remote county of England. Their occupations were such as usually fallto the lot of peasants and they had no portion to give me. I was taughtthe rudiments of no science except reading writing and arithmetic.But I had an inquisitive mind and neglected no means of informationfrom conversation or books.The residence of my parents was within the manor of Ferdinando Falklanda country squire of considerable opulence. At an early age I attractedthe favourable notice of Mr. Collins this gentleman's steward who usedto call in occasionally at my father's.In the summer of the year---- Mr. Falkland visited his estate in our
comment722,county after an absence of several months. This was a period ofmisfortune to me. I was then eighteen years of age. My father lay deadin our cottage and I had lost my mother some years before. In thisforlorn situation I received a message from the squire ordering me torepair to the manor house.My reception was as gracious and encouraging as I could possibly desire.Mr. Falkland questioned me respecting my learning and my conceptions ofmen and things and listened to my answers with condescension andapprobation. He then informed me that he was in want of a secretary andthat if I approved of the employment he would take me into his house.I felt highly flattered by the proposal and found my employment--whichincluded the duties of librarian as well as those of a secretary--easyand agreeable.Mr. Falkland's mode of living was in the utmost degree recluse andsolitary. His features were scarcely ever relaxed in a smile and thedistemper which afflicted him with incessant gloom had its paroxysms.None of the domestics except myself and Mr. Collins approached Mr.Falkland but at stated seasons and then only for a very short interval.Once after I had seen my patron in a strange fit of intolerable anguishI could not help confiding in Mr. Collins that I feared Mr. Falkland hadsome secret trouble and in answer to my communication Mr. Collins toldme the story of Tyrrel's murder.Barnabas Tyrrel had been a neighbouring squire insupportably brutish andarrogant tyrannical to his inferiors and insolent to his equals. Fromthe first he hated Falkland whose dignity and courtesy were a constantrebuke to the other's boorish ill-humours and rejected with scorn allproposals for civil intercourse.The crisis came when Tyrrel who had been expelled from the ruralassembly which met every week at the market-town forced his way in. Hewas intoxicated and at once attacked Falkland knocking him down andthen kicking his prostrate enemy before anyone had time to interfere.To Mr. Falkland disgrace was worse than death. This complication ofignominy base humiliating and public stung him to the very soul andfilled his mind with horror and uproar. One other event closed thatmemorable evening. Mr. Tyrrel was found dead in the street having beenmurdered a few yards from the assembly-house.From that day Falkland was a changed man. His cheerfulness andtranquillity gave way to gloomy and unsociable melancholy and filledwith the ideas of chivalry the humiliating and dishonourable situationin which he had been placed could never be forgotten. To add to hismisfortunes it was presently whispered that he was no other than themurderer of his antagonist and even the magistrates at length decidedthat the matter must be investigated and requested Falkland to appearbefore them.Mr. Falkland attended and easily convinced the magistrates of hisinnocence pointing out that his one desire was to have called out theman who had insulted him so horribly and to have fought him to thedeath. He was not only acquitted but a public demonstration of sympathywas arranged at once to show the esteem in which he was held.A few weeks and the real murderer was discovered. This was a man namedHawkins who with his son had been reduced from an honest livelihoodto beggary and ruin by Tyrrel. On circumstantial evidence Hawkins andhis son were condemned and executed.This was the story Mr. Collins told me in order that I might understandMr. Falkland's unhappy state. In reality it only added to myembarrassment.Was it possible after all that Mr. Falkland should be the murderer It
comment723,was but a passing thought and yet what was the meaning of Mr.Falkland's agonies of mind I could not accept Mr. Collins's view thatMr. Falkland was so much the slave and fool of honour that the shame ofTyrrel's savage assault alone had driven him to this melancholy andsolitude and compelled the violent outbursts of passion._II.--I Learn the Secret_My suspicions would not be set at rest. No spark of malignity washarboured in my soul. I reverenced the sublime mind of Mr. Falkland butI had a mistaken curiosity to find out the truth of Tyrrel's murder.Often it seemed that Mr. Falkland was about to speak to me but themovement always ended in silence.At last one day he sent for me to his room and after making me swearnever to disclose his confidence and warning me that he had observed mysuspicions told me that he was the murderer of Tyrrel and the assassinof the two Hawkins."This it is to be a gentleman a man of honour" Falkland went on inextreme distress. "My virtue my honesty my everlasting peace of mindall sacrificed that I may preserve my good name. And I am as much thefool of fame as ever. Though I be the blackest of villains I will leavebehind me a spotless and illustrious name. Why is it that I am compelledto this confidence From the love of fame. I had no alternative but tomake you my confidant or my victim and perhaps my next murder would nothave been so fortunate. I do not want to shed more blood. It is betterto trust you with the whole truth under every seal of secrecy than tolive in perpetual fear of your penetration. But look what you have donewith your foolishly inquisitive humour. You shall continue in myservice and I will benefit you in respect of fortune but I shallalways hate you. If ever an unguarded word escape from your lips youmay expect to pay for it with your death or worse. By everything thatis sacred preserve your faith"Such was the secret I had been so desirous to know."It is a wretched prospect" I said to myself "that he holds up to me.But I will never become an informer. I will never injure my patron andtherefore he will not be my enemy."It was no long time after this that Mr. Forester--Mr. Falkland'shalf-brother--came to stay in the house while his own residence wasbeing got ready for him and there being little in common between thetwo Mr. Forester being of a peculiarly sociable disposition ourvisitor chose to make me his companion. No sooner was this growingintimacy observed than Mr. Falkland warned me that it was not agreeableto him and that he would not have it."Young man take warning" he said to me one day when we were alone."You little suspect the extent of my power. You might as well think ofescaping from the power of the omnipresent God as from mine."My whole soul now revolted against the treatment I endured and yet Icould not utter a word. I resolved to quit Mr. Falkland's service andwhen Mr. Forester had retired to his own house I wrote a letter to Mr.Falkland to that effect."You shall never quit it with your life" was his reply. "If you attemptit you shall never cease to rue your folly as long as you exist. Do notimagine I am afraid of you I wear an armour against which all yourweapons are impotent. Do you not know miserable wretch that I havesworn to preserve my reputation whatever it cost I have dug a pit foryou and whichever way you move it is ready to swallow you."This speech was the dictate of frenzy and it created in me a similarfrenzy. It determined me to do the very thing against which I was thussolemnly warned and fly from my patron's house.No sooner however had I set off and travelled some miles than ahorseman overtook me and handed me a letter from Mr. Forester. I openedthe letter and read as follows"Williams--My brother Falkland has sent the bearer in pursuit of you.He expects that if found you will return with him. I expect it too.If you are a villain and a rascal you will perhaps endeavour to fly if
comment724,your conscience tells you you are innocent you will out of all doubtcome back. If you come I pledge myself that if you clear yourreputation you shall not only be free to go wherever you please butshall receive every assistance in my power to give."Valentine Forester."To a mind like mine such a letter was enough to draw me from one end ofthe earth to the other. I could not recall anything out of which theshadow of a criminal accusation could be extorted and I returned withwillingness and impatience. I knew the stern inflexibility of Mr.Falkland's mind but I also knew his virtuous and magnanimousprinciples. I could not believe my innocence could be confounded withguilt._III.--My Persecutions and Sufferings_Mr. Falkland accused me of having stolen money and jewels from him andwhen my boxes which I had left behind were opened a watch and certainjewels were found in one of them.My amazement yielded to indignation and horror. I protested my innocenceI declared that Mr. Falkland knew I was innocent and that while I waswholly unable to account for the articles found in my possession Ifirmly believed that their being there was of Mr. Falkland'scontrivance.Mr. Falkland now expressed his willingness to proceed no further againstme and since I had been brought to public shame to let me departwherever I pleased. I was unworthy of his resentment he said and hecould afford to smile at my malice.Mr. Forester however said this was impossible and as a magistratehe thereupon committed me to prison to await my trial. Not one of theservants who had been present at my examination expressed any compassionfor me. The robbery appeared to them atrocious and they were indignantat my recrimination on their excellent master.When I had been about a month in prison the assizes were held but mycase was not brought forward and I was suffered to stand over sixmonths longer.I noticed a change in my jailer's behaviour at this time. He offered tomake better provision for my comfort and as I had no doubt he wasinstigated by Mr. Falkland I answered that he might tell his employer Iwould accept no favours from a man that held a halter about my neck.Then the idea of an escape occurred to me and as I had some proficiencyin carpentry I decided to obtain tools by proposing to make some chairsfor the jailer. My offer was accepted and I gradually accumulated toolsof various sorts--gimlets chisels etc.In the middle of the night my plans being now thoroughly digested Iset about making my escape. I had to get the first door from its hingesand though this was attended with considerable difficulty I wassuccessful. The second door being fastened on the inside all I had todo was to push back the bolts and unscrew the box of the lock.Thus far I had proceeded with the happiest success but close on theother side there was a kennel with a large mastiff dog of which I hadnot the smallest previous knowledge. However I managed to soothe theanimal and go to the wall. Before I had gained half the ascent a voiceat the garden door cried out "Halloa Who is there" At this the dogbegan to bark violently and a second man came out. Alarmed at mysituation I descended on the other side too quickly and in my fallnearly dislocated my ankle.In the meantime the two warders came through a door in the wall ofwhich I had not been aware and were at the place where I had descendedin no time. The pain in my ankle was so intense that I could scarcelystand and I suffered myself to be retaken.The condition in which I was now placed was totally different from thatwhich had preceded this attempt. I was chained all day in my dungeon mymanual labors were at an end my cell was searched every night andevery kind of tool carefully kept from me.Nevertheless an active mind which has once been forced into anyparticular train can scarcely give it up as hopeless. One day I chancedto observe a nail trodden into the mud floor at no great distance from
comment725,me. I seized upon this new treasure and found that I could unlock withit the padlock that fastened me to the staple in the floor. By thismeans I had the pitiful consolation of being able to range withoutconstraint the miserable coop in which I was confined. It became myconstant practice to liberate myself at night but security breedsnegligence. One morning I overslept myself and the turnkey to hissurprise found me disengaged.Again my apartment was changed. I was now put in the strong-room anunderground dungeon and handcuffs were added to my fetters.It was at this time that Thomas Mr. Falkland's footman and an oldacquaintance of mine visited me. He was of the better order ofservants and my condition shocked him. He returned again in theafternoon."Well Master Williams" he said "you have been very wicked to besure and I thought it would have done me good to see you hanged. I knowI am doing wrong but if they hang me too I cannot help it. ForChrist's sake get out of this place I cannot bear the thought of it."With that he slipped into my hand a chisel a file and a saw. Ireceived the implements with great joy and thrust them into my bosom.I waited for bright moonlight it was necessary that I should work inthe night and between nine and seven.It was ten o'clock when I first took off my handcuffs. I then filedthrough my fetters and next performed the same service to the threeiron bars that secured my window. All this was the work of more than twohours. But even with the bars removed the space was by no means wideenough to admit the passing of my body. Therefore I had to loosen thebrickwork and this I did partly with the chisel and partly with one ofthe iron bars. When the space was sufficient for my purpose I creptthrough the opening and stepped upon a shed outside.The prison wall which now had to be scaled was of considerable heightand there was no resource for me but that of making a breach in itslower part. For six hours I worked at this with incredible labour andat last I had made a passage. But the day was breaking and in tenminutes' time the keepers would probably enter my apartment and see thedevastation I had left.I decided to avoid the town as much as possible and depended upon theopen country for protection and so I passed along the lane beyond thewall.I was free of my prison but I was destitute and had not a shilling inthe world._IV.--The Doom of Falkland_Mr. Falkland's implacable animosity pursued me beyond the prison. A
comment726,hundred guineas was at once offered for my recapture and though Ievaded arrest for some months a man named Gines who had at one timebeen a member of a gang of robbers undertook to lay hold of me andtracked me to my place of hiding in London. By this time the hawkerswere actually selling papers in the streets containing "The mostWonderful and Surprising History and Miraculous Adventures of CalebWilliams" for a halfpenny and I had the temerity to purchase one. Inthis I was informed how I Caleb Williams "first robbed and thenbrought false accusations against my master" how I attempted at diverstimes to break out of prison and at last succeeded "in the mostwonderful and incredible manner" and how I had travelled the kingdom indisguise and was now lying concealed in London with a hundred guineasreward for my discovery.It seemed then that there was no end to my persecution and I thought ofdeath as my only release. That very night the landlord of my humblelodgings brought Gines to the house and gave me up to the authorities.And now the result of all my labour to get out of prison and evade mypursuers had brought me back to my starting-place Never was a humancreature so hunted by enemies. What hope was there they would ever ceasetheir persecution.My long-cherished reverence for Mr. Falkland was changed to somethinglike abhorrence. I determined to bring the real criminal to justice.Accordingly when I was taken before the magistrates at Bow Street Ideclared that Mr. Falkland was a murderer and that I was entirelyinnocent.But the magistrates simply told me they had nothing to do with suchstatements and that I seemed a most impudent rascal to trump up suchthings against my master.I was conducted back to the very prison from which I had escaped and mysituation seemed more irremediable than ever. How great therefore wasmy astonishment at the assizes when my case was called to find neitherMr. Falkland nor Mr. Forester nor any individual to appear against me.I who had come to the bar with the sentence of death already ringing inmy ears to be told I was free to go whithersoever I pleased
comment727,I was not however yet free of Mr. Falkland. I was kidnapped by Ginesand an accomplice and carried to an inn and here Mr. Falklandcommanded me to sign a paper declaring that the charge I had allegedagainst him at Bow Street was false malicious and groundless. On myrefusal he told me that he would exercise a power that should grind meto atoms.The impression of that memorable meeting on my understanding isindelible. The deathlike weakness and decay of Mr. Falkland his miseryand rage his haggard emaciated and fleshless visage are still beforeme.There was to be no peace or happiness for me. Wherever I went sooner orlater Gines found me and any new acquaintances turned from me withloathing after they had read the handbills containing my "Wonderful andSurprising History." This man followed me from place to place blastingmy reputation.I now formed my resolution and carried it into execution. At all costs Iwould free myself from this overpowering tyranny.I set out for the chief town of the county in which Mr. Falkland livedand there laid a formal charge of murder before the principalmagistrate.After an interval of three days I met Mr. Falkland in the presence ofthe magistrate. It was now the appearance of a ghost before me. He wasbrought in in a chair unable to stand fatigued and almost destroyed bythe journey he had just taken.Until that moment my breast was steeled to pity it was now too late todraw back.I told my story plainly declared the nobility of Mr. Falkland'scharacter and admitted that my own proceedings now seemed to me adreadful mistake.When I had finished Mr. Falkland rose from his seat and to myinfinite astonishment threw himself into my arms."Williams" said he "you have conquered. All that I most ardentlydesired is for ever frustrated. I have spent a life of the basestcruelty to cover one act of momentary passion. And now"--turning to themagistrate--"do with me as you please. I am prepared to suffer all thevengeance of the law."He survived this dreadful scene but three days and I feel and alwaysshall feel that I have been his murderer. I began these memoirs tovindicate my character. I have now no character that I wish tovindicate.                                   JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHEThe Sorrows of Young Werther     Johann Wolfgang von Goethe the greatest of German poets and     one of the most highly gifted men of the eighteenth century     was born in 1749 at Frankfort-on-the-Main. He received his     early education from his father who was an imperial
comment728,     councillor and in the year 1765 he went to the University of     Leipzig. Goethe's first great work was "Goetz von     Berlichingen" see Vol. XVII. which was translated into     English by Sir Walter Scott. "The Sorrows of Young Werther"     "Die Leiden des jungen Werthers" was begun in 1772 when     Goethe was twenty-three years old and was published     anonymously two years later. It immediately created an immense     sensation made a round of the world and was everywhere     either enthusiastically praised or severely condemned. It     became the fashion of young men to dress themselves in blue     coats and yellow breeches in imitation of the hero and many     of them were moved to follow Werther's example as the simplest     way of settling their love affairs. Nevertheless "Werther"     formed the real basis of Goethe's fame. It was the first     revelation to the world of the genius which a quarter of a     century later was to give it "Faust" Vol. XVI. The story is     frankly sentimental but as such it is easily the best of the     sentimental novels of the eighteenth century. When many years     later Goethe was invited to an audience with Napoleon the     emperor volunteered the information that he had read "Werther"     through six times. Goethe died in March 1832 in his     eighty-fourth year._I.--"I Have Found an Angel"__May 4_. What a strange thing is the heart of man. To leave my dearestfriend and yet to feel happy I know you will forgive me and I inreturn will promise that I will no longer worry myself over every pettystab of fortune. Poor Leonora And yet I was not to blame. Was I infault that while I was pleasantly entertained by the charms of hersister her feeble heart conceived a passion for me And yet I am notwholly blameless. Did I not encourage her emotion Did I not--but whatis man that he dares so to accuse himself Beyond doubt the sufferingsof mankind would be far less did they but endure the present withequanimity instead of raking up the past for memories of sorrow.A wonderful calm has come over me I am alone and feel that a spot likethis was created for the happiness of souls like mine. You ask if youshall send me books I pray you spare me. My heart craves for noexcitement I need strains to soothe me and I find them to perfectionin my Homer._May 17_. I have formed many acquaintances but as yet have found nofriends. If you inquire what sort of people are here I answer "the sameas everywhere." The human race is a monotonous affair. The majoritylabours nearly all its time for mere subsistence and is then sodistressed to have a small portion of freedom still unemployed that itexerts even greater efforts to get rid of it.I have just become acquainted with a very worthy person the districtjudge. They tell me how charming it is to see him in the midst of hisfamily of nine. His eldest daughter is much spoken of. He has invited meto go and see him._June 16_. Why do I not write to you You should have guessed that I waspre-occupied that in a word that I have made a friend who has won myheart. I have found--I know not what. An angel Nonsense Everyone sodescribes his mistress. And yet I cannot tell you how perfect she is orwhy so perfect. Between ourselves I have been three times on the pointof throwing down my pen ordering my horse and riding out. And yet thismorning I determined not to ride to-day and I keep running to thewindow to see how high the sun is.I could not restrain myself go to her I must. I have just returnedWilhelm and while I eat my supper I will write to you. I had alreadymade the acquaintance of her aunt the judge's sister and with her Iwas going to accompany Charlotte to a ball given by some young people in
comment729,the neighbourhood. While we were on our way to fetch her my companionwas loud in her praises of her niece's beauty and charm. "Take carehowever" she added "that you do not lose your heart." "Why" I asked."Because she is already betrothed to a most excellent man."As the door opened I saw before me the most charming sight that I haveever beheld. Six children of various ages were running about the halland surrounding a lady of medium height with a lovely figure dressedin a robe of simple white trimmed with pink ribbons. She held a loaf ofbrown bread and was cutting slices for the little ones all round. Sheapologised for not being quite ready explaining that household dutieshad made her forget the children's supper which they always preferredto take from her. I uttered some unmeaning compliment but my whole soulwas absorbed by her air her voice her manner. You who know me canimagine how I gazed upon her rich dark eyes how my soul gloated overher warm lips and fresh glowing cheeks.Never did I dance more lightly I felt myself more than mortal holdingthis loveliest of creatures in my arms flying with her as rapidly asthe wind till I lost sight of every other object. And oh Wilhelm Ivowed at that moment that no maiden whom I loved should ever waltz withanother than myself if I went to perdition for it.Returning from the ball there was a most magnificent sunrise. Ourcompanions were asleep. Charlotte asked me if I did not wish to sleeptoo and begged me not to stand on ceremony. Looking deep into her eyesI answered "As long as those eyes remain open there is no fear formine." We continued awake until we reached her door. I left her askingher permission to call in the course of the day. She consented and Iwent Since then sun moon and stars may pursue their course I knownot whether it is day or night the whole world is nothing to me._June 21_. My days are as happy as those reserved by God for His electand whatever be my fate hereafter I can never say that I have nottasted joy--the purest joy of life. Little did I think when I selectedthis spot for my home that all heaven lay within half a league of it.How childish is man. To be disturbed about a mere look. We had been toWalheim but during our walk I thought I saw in Charlotte's eyes--I am afool but forgive me. You should see her eyes. However to be brief as
comment730,the ladies were preparing to drive away I watched her eyes theywandered from one to another but they did not alight on me--on me whosaw nothing but her. She noticed me not. The carriage drove off and myeyes filled with tears. Suddenly I saw Charlotte's bonnet leaning out ofthe window and she turned to look back--was it at me I know not andin uncertainty is my consolation. Perhaps she turned to look at me.Perhaps. Good-night. What a child I am_July 10_. Someone asked me the other day how I like her. How I _like_her What sort of creature must he be who merely likes Charlotte Whoseentire being were not absolutely filled with her Like her One might aswell ask if I like Ossian._July 13_. No I am not deceived. In her dark eyes I read a realinterest in me. Yes I feel it and I believe my own heart which tellsme--dare I say it--that she loves me. How the idea exalts me in my owneyes. And as you can understand my feelings I may say to you how Ihonour myself because she loves me.I do not know a man able to take my place in her heart yet when shespeaks of Albert with so much warmth and affection I feel like asoldier who has been stripped of all his honours. Sometimes when we aretalking in the eagerness of conversation she comes closer to me andher balmy breath reaches my lips I feel that I could sink into theearth for very joy. And yet Wilhelm if I know myself and should everdare--you understand me--No no my heart is not so corrupt it is weakbut is not that a degree of corruptionShe is to me a sacred being how her simplest song enchants me.Sometimes when I am ready to commit suicide she sings some favouriteair and instantly the gloom and madness are dispersed._July 24_. Yes dear Charlotte. I will arrange everything. Only give memore commissions the more the better. One thing however I mustrequest you--use no more writing-sand with the letters you send meToday I raised your letter to my lips and it set my teeth on edge._II.--Bereft of Comfort__July 30_. Albert is arrived and I must take my departure. Were he thebest of men and I absolutely beneath him I could not endure to see himin possession of my perfect being. Enough her betrothed is here. A finefellow whom I cannot help liking. And he is so considerate he has notgiven Charlotte one kiss in my presence. Heaven reward him for it. He isfree from ill-humour which you know is the fault I detest most. I donot ask whether he may not now and then tease her with some littlejealousies as I know that in his place I should not be entirely freefrom such feelings._August 8_. I am amazed to see from my diary which I have somewhatneglected of late how deliberately I have entangled myself step bystep. But even though I see the result plainly I have no thought ofacting with any greater prudence. And yet I feel that if only I knewwhere to go I would abandon everything and fly from this place.And yet I feel that if I were not a fool I could enjoy life here mostdelightfully. Admitted into this charming family loved by the father as
comment731,a son by his children as a second father and by CharlotteFurthermore Albert welcomes me with the heartiest affection and lovesme next to Charlotte more than all the world._August 21_. In vain do I stretch out my arms towards her when I wake inthe morning. In vain do I seek for her when some innocent dream hashappily deceived me and placed me near her in the fields when I haveseized her hand and covered it with kisses. Tears flow from my oppressedheart and bereft of all comfort I weep over my future woes._August 28_. This is my birthday and early in the morning I received apacket from Albert. I found within one of the pink ribbons whichCharlotte wore in her dress the first time I saw her and which I hadoften asked her to give me. With it were two volumes of Wetstein'sHomer a book I had often wished for. How well they understood thoselittle attentions of friendship so superior to costly presents unhappybeing that I am. Why do I thus deceive myself What is to be the outcomeof all this wild aimless endless passion I cannot pray except to her.Oh Wilhelm the hermit's cell his sackcloth and girdle of thornswould be luxury and indulgence compared with what I have to suffer._October 20_. I have taken the plunge and following your repeatedadvice I have taken a post with the ambassador. We arrived hereyesterday. If he were less peevish and morose all would be well. As itis he occasions me continual annoyance he is the most punctiliousblockhead in the world. He does everything step by step with the paltryfussiness of an old woman and he is a man whom it is impossible toplease because he is never pleased with himself._January 20_. I have but one being here to interest me my dearCharlotte--a Miss B----. She resembles you if indeed anyone canpossibly resemble you. "Ah" you will say "he has learnt to pay finecompliments." And this is partly true I have been very agreeablelately as it was not in my power to be otherwise. But I must tell youof Miss B----. She has abundance of soul which flashes from her deepblue eyes. Her rank is a torment to her and satisfies no single desireof her heart. She knows you my dear Charlotte as I have told her allabout you and renders homage to your merits but her homage is notexacted but voluntary--she loves you and delights to hear you made thesubject of conversation. Adieu Is Albert with you and what is he toyou Forgive the question._February 20_. I thank you Albert for having deceived me. I waited forthe news that your wedding-day was fixed and I meant on that day toremove Charlotte's picture from the wall and bury it with some oldpapers that I wish destroyed.

His conversationgives me no more amusement than I should derive from an ordinarywell-written book. Whither am I going I think it would be better for meto visit the mines in----. But I am only deluding myself thus. You knowthat I only want to be near my dear Charlotte once more. I smile at thesuggestion of my heart but I obey its dictates._July 29_. Dear Wilhelm my whole frame feels convulsed when I seeAlbert put his arms round that slender waist. Oh the very thought offolding that dearest of heaven's creatures in one's arms.And--shall I avow it Why should I not--she would have been happier

We cannot go on in this manner anylonger" It were idle to attempt to describe my emotions I was as ifparalysed it was as if the sun had suddenly gone out.

I say Amen.Charlotte Charlotte Farewell Farewell                                   Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship     Goethe's prestige was enormously increased by the publication     in 1796 of "Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship" "Wilhelm     Meisters Lehrjahre". Representing the fruit of twenty years'     labour it was like "Faust" written in fragments during the     ripest period of his intellectual activity. The story of     "Wilhelm Meister" is by no means exciting but as a gallery     of portraits and repository of wise observation it is more     characteristic of the genius of its author than any other of     his prose works. It is more mellow than "Werther" and the     action moves slower. Incident follows incident in a leisurely     fashion. The keen psychological analysis in the story is     assumed to have been derived from Goethe's own experience.     "Wilhelm Meister" was dramatised and produced at Leipzig a few     years ago but with no marked success._I.--On the Road_The moment was now at hand to which poor Mariana had been lookingforward as to the last of her life. Wilhelm Meister the man she lovedwas departing on a long journey in connection with his father'sbusiness a disagreeable lover was threatening to come.
comment734,"I am miserable" she exclaimed "miserable for life I love him and heloves me yet I see that we must part and know not how I shall surviveit. Wilhelm is poor and can do nothing for me--"Darkness had scarcely come on when Wilhelm glided forth to her house hecarried with him a letter in which he entreated her to marry himforthwith saying that he would abandon his father's business and earnhis living on the stage to which he had always been strongly drawn.This he could do with certainty as he was well acquainted with Serlomanager of a theatre in a town at some distance.His plan was to leave the letter with her and return a little later forher answer. The vehemence of his emotion at first prevented him fromnoticing that she did not greet him with her wonted heartiness shecomplained of a headache and would not hear of his coming back laterthat evening. Suspecting nothing wrong he ceased to urge her but hefelt that this was not the moment for delivering his letter. He retainedit therefore and in a tumult of insatiable love as he tore himselfaway from her he snatched one of her neckerchiefs and after pressingit madly to his lips crushed it into his pocket.His whole being was in a ferment of excitement as he walked aimlesslyabout the streets. Midnight found him again in the neighbourhood ofMariana's house consciousness of the fact brought him to himself. Hewent slowly away set himself for home and constantly turned roundagain at last with an effort he constrained himself and actuallydeparted. At the corner of the street looking back yet once more heimagined that he saw Mariana's door open and a dark figure issue fromit. He was too distant to see clearly and in a moment the appearancewas lost in the night.On his way he had almost effaced the unexpected delusion from his mindby the most sufficient reasons. To soothe his heart and put the lastseal on his returning belief ere he disrobed for the night he took herkerchief from his pocket. The rustle of a letter which fell from it tookthe kerchief from his lips he lifted it and read a passionate letterfrom another man railing at her for her coldness on the precedingnight making an appointment for that same night and breathing a spiritof intimate familiarity.                                   A violent fever with its train of consequences besides the unweariedattentions of his family were so many fresh occupations for his mindand formed a kind of painful entertainment. On his recovery hedetermined to abandon for ever his former leaning towards the stage andto apply himself with greater diligence to business and to the greatcontentment of his father no one was now more diligent in thecounting-house. For a long time he continued to show exemplary attentionto his duties and was then thought sufficiently master of his businessto be sent on a long expedition on behalf of the firm.The first part of his business successfully accomplished Wilhelm foundhimself at a little mountain town called Hochdorf. A troupe of actorshad got stranded there their exchequer empty their properties seizedas security for debts. Wilhelm recognised among them an old man whom herecollected as having seen on the stage with Mariana. After somehesitation he hazarded a question concerning her. "Do not speak to meof that baggage" cried the old man. "I am ashamed that I felt such afriendship for her. Yet had you known the girl better you would excuseme. I loved her as my own daughter indeed I had formed a resolution totake the creature into my own house and save her from the hands of thatold crone Barbara her confidante but my wife died and so the project
comment735,came to nothing. At the end of our stay in your native town I noticed avisible sadness about her. I questioned her but she evaded me. At lastwe set out on our journey. She travelled in the same coach with me andI soon observed what she could not deny that she was about to become amother. In a short time the manager made the same discovery he paid heroff at once and left her behind at the village inn."Wilhelm's old wounds were all torn open afresh by the old man's storythe thought that perhaps Mariana was not wholly unworthy of his love wasagain brought to life. Nay even the bitter accusations brought againsther could not lower her in his estimation for he as well as she wasguilty in all her aberrations. He saw her as a frail ill-succouredmother wandering helplessly about the world.The old longing for the stage came back to him with redoubled force hedetermined to give it vent for a time at least and to this end headvanced to Melina the manager of the actors a sum of money sufficientto redeem their properties and accompanied the troupe until such timeas it should be repaid.A profitable engagement soon came their way. A wealthy count whohappened to pass through the town required their services to entertainthe prince whom he was shortly expecting as a guest. For several weeksthey stayed at his castle and when on the prince's departure theirengagement came to an end they were all weightier in purse than theyhad been for many a long day. Melina was now in hopes to get establishedwith his company in a thriving town at some distance. To get there itwas necessary to take a considerable journey by unfrequented roads.Accordingly conveyances were hired and a start was made. Towardsevening they began to pitch their camp in the midst of a beech woodall were busily engaged about the task allotted to each--the women toprepare the evening meal the men to attend to everything necessary fortheir comfort for the night. All at once a shot went off immediatelyanother the party flew asunder in terror. Next moment armed men were tobe seen pressing forward to the spot where the coaches packed withluggage stood.The men all rushed at the intruders. Wilhelm fired his pistol at one whowas already on the top of the coach cutting the cords of the packages.
comment736,The scoundrel fell but several of his friends rushed to his aid ourhero fell stunned by a shot-wound and by a sword-stroke that almostpenetrated to his brain.When he recovered his senses it was to find himself deserted by all hiscompanions except two of the girls. His head was lying in Phillina'slap while Mignon the child whom he had rescued from a brutal circusmaster who was ill-treating her was vainly trying to staunch his woundswith her hair. For some time they continued in this position no onereturning to their aid. At last they heard a troop of horses coming upthe road a young lady emerged on horseback accompanied by somecavaliers. Wilhelm fixed his eye on the soft calm sympathisingfeatures of the stranger he thought he had never seen aught nobler ormore lovely. In a few moments one of the party stepped to the side ofour hero. He held in his hand some surgeon's instruments and bandageswith which he hastily attended to his wounds. The lady asked severalquestions and then turning to the old gentleman said "Dear unclemay I be generous at your expense" taking off the coat that she waswearing as she spoke and laying it softly above him. As he tried toopen his mouth to stammer out some words of gratitude to the beautifulAmazon the impression of her presence worked so strongly on his sensesthat all at once it seemed to him that her head was encircled with raysand a glancing light seemed by degrees to spread itself all over herform. At this moment the surgeon gave him a sharper twinge he lostconsciousness and on returning to himself the horsemen and coaches thefair one and her attendants had vanished like a dream._II.--A Message from the Dead_Wilhelm's wounds were slow to heal and it was long before he was ableto move about freely again. When he fully recovered he went to his oldfriend Serlo and obtained a position in his company both for himselfand also for many of his companions in misfortune.With Serlo he remained for a considerable period until an untowardevent led to his leaving him. Aurelia Serlo's sister had longentertained an affection for a nobleman whom she knew by the name ofLothario though at one time much attached to her his affection hadcooled off and for a long time now he had not had any communicationwith her. Heartbroken at this treatment though still devotedly attachedto him she gradually pined away and complete neglect of her healthfinally brought her to her death-bed. Before she died however shewrote a letter of farewell to him which she entrusted to Wilhelm todeliver as soon after her death as possible.Arrived at the castle where the baron lived he found his lordshipunable to give him any attention that day as he was engaged to fight aduel and was busy settling up his affairs in preparation. Wilhelm was
comment737,requested to remain until a more convenient season. On the followingmorning while the company were seated at breakfast the baron wasbrought back in a carriage seriously wounded.As the surgeon came out from attending him the band hanging from hispouch caught Wilhelm's eye he fancied that he knew it. He was convincedthat he beheld the very pouch of the surgeon who had dressed his woundsin the forest and the hope so long deferred of again finding hislovely Amazon struck like a flame through his soul.The abb entered from Lothario's chamber and said to Wilhelm "Thebaron bids me ask you to remain here to share his hospitality and inthe present circumstances to contribute to his solacement."From this hour our friend was treated in the house as if he belonged toit."We have a kindness to ask of you" said Jarno the baron's confidentialcompanion to Wilhelm one morning. "The violent unreasonable love andpassionateness of the Lady Lydia only hinder the baron's recovery. Shemust be removed by some means. His wound requires rest and calmness yousee how she tortures him with her tempestuous anxieties herungovernable terrors her never-drying tears. Enough Our doctorexpressly requires that she should quit us for a while we havepersuaded her to pay a visit to a lady an old friend of hers it willbe your task to escort her as you can best be spared.""I willingly undertake the charge" said Wilhelm "though it is easy toforesee the pain I shall have to suffer from the tears the despair ofLydia.""And for this no small reward awaits you" said Jarno. "FrauleinTheresa with whom you will get acquainted is a lady such as you willrarely see. Indeed were it not for an unfortunate passage between hermother and the baron she would long since have been married to hislordship."When they returned from their visit Lothario was in the way of fullrecovery. He was now for the first time able to talk with Wilhelm aboutthe sad cause that had brought him to the castle. "You may howeverwell forgive me" he said with a smile "that I forsook Aurelia forTheresa with the one I could expect a calm and cheerful life with theother not a happy hour.""I confess" said Wilhelm "that in coming hither I had no small angerin my heart against you that I proposed to censure with severity yourconduct towards Aurelia. But at the grave in which the hapless mothersleeps let me ask you why you acknowledge not the child--a son in whomany father might rejoice and whom you appear entirely to overlook. Withyour tender nature how can you altogether cast away the instinct of aparent""Of whom do you speak" said Lothario. "I do not understand you.""Of whom but your son Aurelia's son the lovely child to whose goodfortune there is nothing wanting but that a tender father shouldacknowledge and receive him."
comment738,"You mistake my friend" said Lothario "Aurelia never had a son. Iknow of no child or I would gladly acknowledge it. But did she evergive you to believe that the boy was hers--was mine""I cannot recollect that I ever heard a word from her expressly on thesubject but we took it so and I never for a moment doubted it.""I can give you a clue to this perplexity" interposed Jarno. "An oldwoman whom Wilhelm must have noticed gave Aurelia the child tellingher that it was yours. She accepted it eagerly hoping to alleviate hersorrows by its presence and in truth it gave her many a comfortablehour."This discovery awoke anxieties in Wilhelm. He thought of the beautifulchild Felix with the liveliest apprehension and expressed his wish toremove him from the state in which he was."We can soon arrange that" said Lothario. "I think you ought yourselfto take charge of him what in us the women leave uncultivated childrencultivate when we retain them near us."It was agreed to lose no time in putting this plan into execution andWilhelm departed forthwith to fetch the child.Passing through the house he found Aurelia's old serving-maid whom hehad never seen at close quarters before employed in sewing. Felix andMignon were sitting by her on the floor."Art thou the person" he demanded earnestly "from whom Aureliareceived this child"She looked up and turned her face to him he saw her in full light andstarted back in terror. It was old Barbara"Where is Mariana" cried he."Far from here.""And Felix""Is the son of that unhappy and too tender-hearted girl. Here areMariana's last words" she added handing him a letter."She is dead" cried he."Dead" said the old woman.A bitter grief took hold of Wilhelm he could scarcely read the wordsthat Barbara placed before him."If this should reach thee then lament thine ill-starred friend. Theboy whose birth I survived but a few days is thine. I die faithful tothee much as appearances may be against me with thee I lost everythingthat bound me to life. This will be my only comfort that though Icannot call myself blameless towards thee I am free from blame."Wilhelm was stupified by this news. He removed the children fromBarbara's care and took them both back with him to Lothario's castle.Felix he kept with him while Mignon who was not in the best of healthwas sent by the baron to the house of his sister at some distance._III.--Wilhelm's Apprenticeship_One evening Jarno said to Wilhelm "We can now consider you as one ofourselves with such security that it were unjust not to introduce youdeeper into our mysteries. You shall see what a curious little world isat your very hand and how well you are known in it." He led our friendthrough certain unknown chambers and galleries of the castle to a doorstrongly framed with iron. Jarno knocked the door opened a little soas to admit one person. Jarno introduced our friend but did not followhim.Within was complete darkness. A voice cried "Enter" he pressed forward
comment739,and found that only tapestry was hemming him in. Raising this heentered. Within he found a man who said in a tone of dignity "Toguard from error is not the instructor's duty but to lead the erringpupil nay let him quaff his error in deep satiating draughts he whoonly tastes his error will long dwell with it he who drains it to thedregs will if he be not crazy find it out."A curtain closed before the figure whom Wilhelm vaguely recollected ashaving seen at some time previously possibly on the night when he hadparted from Mariana. Then the curtain opened again another figureadvanced "Learn to know the men who may be trusted" he said and againthe curtain closed. "Dispute not with us" cried a voice "thou artsaved thou art on the way to the goal. None of thy follies wilt thourepent none wilt thou wish to repeat."The curtain opened the abb came into view. "Come hither" he cried tohis marvelling friend. Wilhelm mounted the steps. On the table lay alittle roll."Here is your indenture" said the abb. "Take it to heart it is ofweighty import." Wilhelm opened it and read     "_INDENTURE_.     "_Art is long life short judgment difficult opportunity     transient. To act is easy to think is hard to act according     to our thought is troublesome. It is but a part of art that     can be taught the artist needs it all. Who knows it half     speaks much and is always wrong who knows it all speaks     seldom and is inclined to act. No one knows what he is doing     while he acts aright but of wrong-doing we are always     conscious. The instruction which the true artist gives us     opens the mind for where words fail him deeds speak. The     true scholar learns from the known to unfold the unknown and     approaches more and more to being a master_----""Enough" cried the abb "the rest in due time. Now look round youamong these cases." With astonishment Wilhelm found among others"_Lothario's Apprenticeship" "Jarno's Apprenticeship_" and his own"_Apprenticeship_" placed there. "May I hope to look into these rolls""In this chamber nothing is now hid from you."Wilhelm heard a noise behind him and saw a child's face peeping throughthe tapestry at the end of the room. It was Felix. His father rushedtowards him took him in his arms and pressed him to his heart."Yes I feel it" cried he. "Thou art mine. For what a gift of Heavenhave I to thank my friends How comest thou my child at this importantmoment""Ask not" said the abb. "Hail young man Thy apprenticeship is donenature has pronounced thee free."After sorrow often and in vain repeated for the loss of Mariana
comment740,Wilhelm felt that he must find a mother for the boy and also that hecould not find one equal to Theresa. With this gifted lady he was nowthoroughly acquainted. Such a spouse and helpmate seemed the only one totrust to in such circumstances. Her affection for Lothario did not makehim hesitate she looked on herself as free she had even spoken ofmarrying with indifference indeed but as a matter understood.Before Theresa's answer came to hand Lothario sent for our friend. "Mysister Natalia bids me beg of you to go to her as soon as possible. PoorMignon seems to be getting steadily worse and it is thought that yourpresence might allay the malady." Wilhelm agreed and proceeded on thejourney._IV.--Heart Against Reason_Behind a light screen which threw a shadow on her sat a young ladyreading she rose and came to him. It was the Amazon Unable to restrainhimself he fell on his knee and cried "It is she" He seized her handand kissed it with unbounded rapture.A day or two later the following letter from Theresa was handed toWilhelm."I am yours as I am and as you know me. I call you mine as you areand as I know you. As it is no passion but trust and inclination foreach other that leads us together we run less risk than thousands ofothers. You will forgive me will you not if I still think often andkindly of my former friend in return I will press Felix to my heartas if I were his mother. Adieu dear friend Theresa clasps you to herbreast with hope and joy."Natalia wrote a letter to her brother she invited Wilhelm to add a wordor two. They were just about to seal it when Jarno unexpectedly camein."I am come" he said "to give you very curious and pleasing tidingsabout Theresa now guess.""We are more skilful than you think" said Natalia smiling. "Before youasked we had the answer down in black and white" handing him as shespoke the letter she had just written. Jarno read the sheet hastily."What shall I say" cried he. "Surprise against surprise I came to tellyou that Theresa is not the daughter of her reputed mother. There is noobstacle to her marriage with Lothario _I came to ask you to prepareher for it_.""And what" said Lothario taking Wilhelm by the hand "what if youralliance with my sister were the secret article on which depended myalliance with Theresa These amends the noble maiden has appointed foryou she has vowed that we two pairs should appear together at thealtar. 'His reason has made choice of me' she said 'his heart demandsNatalia my reason shall assist his heart.'"Lothario embraced his friend and led him to Natalia who with Theresacame to meet them. "To my mind thou resemblest Saul the son of Kishwho went out to seek his father's asses and found a kingdom.""I know not the worth of a kingdom" said Wilhelm "but I know that Ihave attained a happiness undeserved which I would not change foranything in life."                                   OLIVER GOLDSMITHThe Vicar of Wakefield     Oliver Goldsmith the most versatile and perhaps the most     unstable of eighteenth century men of letters was born in     Ireland on November 10 1728. At Trinity College Dublin he     revealed three characteristics that clung to him throughout     his career--high spirits conversational brilliance and     inability to keep money in his pocket. After a spell of     "philosophic vagabondage" on the Continent he settled in     London in 1756 earned money in various ways and spent it     all. "The Vicar of Wakefield" perhaps the greatest of all     Goldsmith's works was published on March 27 1766 after Dr.     Johnson had raised 60 for him on the manuscript of it. The     liveliness and grace of Goldsmith's style were never more     plainly manifested than in this delightful story and its     faults--it contains many coincidences and improbabilities--are     far more than atoned for by the masterly portrait of the     simple manly generous and wholly lovable vicar who is the     central figure of the story. "It has" says Mitford "the
comment741,     truth of Richardson without his minuteness and the humour of     Fielding without his grossness if it yields to LeSage in the     diversified variety of his views of life it far excels him in     the description of domestic virtues and the pleasing moral of     the tale." Goldsmith died on April 4 1774. See also Vol.     XVII._I.--Family Portraits_I was ever of opinion that the honest man who married and brought up alarge family did more service than he who continued single and onlytalked of population. From this motive I chose my wife as she did herwedding-gown not for a fine glossy surface but such qualities as wouldwear well. There was nothing that could make us angry with the world oreach other. We had no revolutions to fear nor fatigues to undergo allour adventures were by the fireside and all our migrations from theblue bed to the brown.My children as they were educated without softness so they were atonce well-formed and healthy my four sons hardy and active my twodaughters beautiful and blooming. Olivia the elder daughter was opensprightly and commanding Sophia's features were not so striking atfirst but often did more certain execution for they were soft modestand alluring.The profits of my living I made over to the orphans and widows of theclergy of our diocese for having a sufficient fortune of my own I wascareless of temporalities and felt a secret pleasure in doing my dutywithout reward.My eldest son George just upon leaving college fixed his affectionsupon Miss Arabella Wilmot the daughter of a neighbouring clergyman whowas in circumstances to give her a large fortune. Mr. Wilmot was notaverse to the match but after the day for the nuptials had been fixedI engaged in a dispute with him which threatened to interrupt ourintended alliance. I have always maintained that it is unlawful for apriest of the Church of England after the death of his first wife totake a second and I showed Mr. Wilmot a tract which I had written indefence of this principle. It was not till too late I discovered that hewas violently attached to the contrary opinion and with good reasonfor he was at that time actually courting a fourth wife.While the controversy was hottest a relation with a face of concerncalled me out."The merchant in town" he said "in whose hands your money was lodgedhas gone off to avoid a statute of bankruptcy. Your fortune is nowalmost nothing."It would be useless to describe the sensations of my family when Idivulged the news. Near a fortnight had passed before I attempted torestrain their affliction for premature consolation is but theremembrance of sorrow. During this interval I determined to send myeldest son to London and I accepted a small cure of fifteen pounds ayear in a distant neighbourhood.The first day's journey brought us within thirty miles of our futureretreat and we put up at an obscure inn in a village by the way. At theinn was a gentleman who the landlord told me had been so liberal inhis charity that he had no money left to pay his reckoning. I could notavoid expressing my concern at seeing a gentleman in such circumstancesand offered the stranger my purse. "I take it with all my heart sir"replied he "and am glad that my late oversight has shown me that there
comment742,are still some men like you." The stranger's conversation was sopleasing and instructive that we were rejoiced to hear that he was goingthe same way as ourselves.The next morning we all set forward together. Mr. Burchell and Ilightened the fatigues of the road with philosophical disputes and healso informed me to whom the different seats belonged that lay in ourview."That Dr. Primrose" he said to me pointing to a very magnificenthouse "belongs to Mr. Thornhill a young gentleman who enjoys a largefortune though entirely dependent upon the will of his uncle SirWilliam Thornhill.""What" cried I "is my young landlord then the nephew of one who isrepresented as a man of consummate benevolence"At this point we were alarmed by the cries of my family and I perceivedmy youngest daughter in the midst of a rapid stream and struggling withthe torrent she must have certainly perished had not my companioninstantly plunged in to her relief. Her gratitude may be more readilyimagined than described she thanked her deliverer more with looks thanwords. Soon afterwards Mr. Burchell took leave of us and we pursued ourjourney to the place of our retreat._II.--The Squire_At a small distance from our habitation was a seat overshaded by a hedgeof hawthorn and honeysuckle. Here when the weather was fine and ourlabour soon finished we usually sat together to enjoy an extensivelandscape in the calm of the evening. On an afternoon about thebeginning of autumn when I had drawn out my family to the seat dogsand horsemen swept past us with great swiftness. After them a younggentleman of a more genteel appearance than the rest came forwardand instead of pursuing the chase stopped short and approached uswith a careless superior air. He let us know that his name wasThornhill and that he was the owner of the estate that lay around us.As his address though confident was easy we soon became morefamiliar and the whole family seemed earnest to please him.As soon as he was gone my wife gave the opinion that it was a mostfortunate hit and hoped again to see the day in which we might hold upour heads with the best of them."For my part" cried Olivia "I don't like him he is so extremelyimpudent and familiar." I interpreted this speech by contrary and foundthat Olivia secretly admired him."To confess the truth" said I "he has not prepossessed me in hisfavour. I had heard that he was particularly remarkable forfaithlessness to the fair sex."A few days afterwards we entertained our young landlord at dinner andit may be easily supposed what provisions were exhausted to make anappearance. As he directed his looks and conversation to Olivia it wasno longer doubted but that she was the object that induced him to be ourvisitor and my wife exulted in her daughter's victory as if it were herown.On one evening Mr. Thornhill came with two young ladies richly dressedwhom he introduced as women of very great distinction and fashion fromtown. The two ladies threw my girls quite into the shade for they wouldtalk of nothing but high life and high-lived company. 'Tis true theyonce or twice mortified us sensibly by slipping out an oath theirfinery however threw a veil over any grossness in their conversation.I now began to find that all my long and painful lectures upontemperance simplicity and contentment were entirely disregarded. Thedistinctions lately paid us by our betters awakened that pride which Ihad laid asleep but not removed. When the two ladies of quality showeda willingness to take our girls to town with them as companions my wifewas overjoyed at our good fortune. But Mr. Burchell who had at firstbeen a welcome guest at our house but had become less welcome since wehad been favoured with the company of persons of superior station
comment743,dissuaded her with great ardour and so angered her that she ended byasking him to stay away.Returning home one day I found my wife and girls all in tears Mr.Thornhill having been there to inform them that their journey to townwas entirely over. The two ladies having heard reports of us from somemalicious person were that day set out for London. We were not long infinding who it was that had been so base as to asperse the character ofa family so harmless as ours. One of our boys found a letter-case whichwe knew to belong to Mr. Burchell. Within it was a sealed notesuperscribed "The copy of a letter to be sent to the two ladies atThornhill Castle." At the joint solicitation of the family I opened itand read as follows"Ladies--I am informed that you have some intention of bringing twoyoung ladies to town whom I have some knowledge of under the characterof companions. As I would neither have simplicity imposed upon norvirtue contaminated I must offer it as my opinion that the improprietyof such a step will be attended with dangerous consequences. Taketherefore the admonition of a friend and seriously reflect on theconsequences of introducing infamy and vice into retreats where peaceand innocence have hitherto resided."Our doubts were now at an end. It appeared to me one of the vilestinstances of unprovoked ingratitude I had ever met with. As we setruminating upon schemes of vengeance Mr. Burchell himself entered andsat down."Do you know this sir--this pocket-book" said I."Yes sir" returned he with a face of impenetrable assurance."And do you know this letter""Yes it was I that wrote that letter.""And how could you so basely presume to write this letter""And how came you" replied he with looks of unparalleled effrontery"so basely to presume to open this letter"I could scarcely govern my passion. "Ungrateful wretch" I cried."Begone and no longer pollute my dwelling with thy baseness"So saying I threw him his pocket-book which he took up with a smileand left us astonished at the serenity of his assurance._III.--The Elopement_The visits of Mr. Thornhill now became more frequent and longer but allthe schemes of Olivia and her mother to bring him to a declaration cameto nothing. And although Olivia considered his fine sentiments asinstances of the most exalted passion it seemed to me plain that theyhad more of love than matrimony in them.One evening as I sat by the fireside thanking Heaven for tranquillityhealth and competence and thinking myself happier than the greatestmonarch upon earth I noticed that Olivia was absent."Where is my darling Olivia" I asked. Just as I spoke my boy Dick camerunning in."Oh papa papa she is gone from us she is gone from us for ever""Gone child""Yes she is gone off with two gentlemen in a postchaise and one ofthem kissed her. And she cried very much but he persuaded her and shewent into the chaise.""Now then" cried I "may Heaven's everlasting fury light upon him andhis Thus to rob me of my child Bring me my pistols I'll pursue thetraitor. Old as I am he shall find I can sting him yet--the perfidiousvillain"My poor wife caught me in her arms."Indeed sir" said my son Moses "your rage is too violent.""I did not curse him child did I""Indeed sir you did.""Then may Heaven forgive me and him. But it is not--it is not a small
comment744,distress that can wring tears from these old eyes. My child--to undo mydarling May confusion seize--Heaven forgive me What am I about to sayHad she but died My son bring hither my Bible and my staff. I willpursue her and though I cannot save her from shame I may prevent thecontinuance of her iniquity."My suspicions fell entirely upon our young landlord whose character forsuch intrigues was but too well known. I therefore directed my stepstowards Thornhill Castle. He soon appeared with the most open familiarair and seemed perfectly amazed at my daughter's elopement protestingupon his honour that he was quite a stranger to it. A man howeveraverred that my daughter and Mr. Burchell had been seen driving veryfast towards the Wells about thirty miles distant.I walked towards the Wells with earnestness and on entering the town Iwas met by a person on horseback whom I remembered to have seen at thesquire's and he assured me that if I followed them to the races whichwere but thirty miles further I might depend upon overtaking them.Early the next day I walked forward to the races but saw nothing of mydaughter or of Mr. Burchell.The agitations of my mind and the fatigues I had undergone now threwme into a fever. I retired to a little ale-house by the roadside andhere I languished for nearly three weeks.The night coming on as I was twenty miles from home on my returnjourney I put up at a little public-house and asked for the landlord'scompany over a pint of wine. I could hear the landlady upstairs bitterlyreproaching a lodger who could not pay."Out I say" she cried "pack out this moment""Oh dear madame" replied the stranger "pity a poor abandonedcreature for one night and death will soon do the rest"I instantly knew the voice of my poor ruined child Olivia and flew toher rescue."Welcome anyway welcome my dearest lost one to your poor old father'sbosom""Oh my own dear"--for minutes she could say no more--"my own dearestgood papa You can't forgive me--I know you cannot""Yes my child from my heart I do forgive thee." After we had talkedourselves into some tranquillity I said "It surprises me how a person
comment745,of Mr. Burchell's seeming honour could be guilty of such deliberatebaseness.""My dear papa" returned my daughter "you labour under a strangemistake. It is Mr. Thornhill who has ruined me who employed the twoladies as he called them but who in fact were abandoned women of thetown to decoy us up to London. Their artifices would certainly havesucceeded but for Mr. Burchell's letter who directed those reproachesat them which we all applied to ourselves.""You amaze me my dear" cried I. "But tell me what temptation was itthat could thus obliterate your virtue""He offered me marriage" replied she. "We were indeed married secretlyby a popish priest whose name I was sworn to conceal.""What" interrupted I. "And were you indeed married""Alas" she said "he has been married already by the same priest to sixor eight wives more whom like me he has deceived and abandoned.""Have patience my child" cried I "and I hope things will yet bebetter. To-morrow I'll carry you home to your mother. Poor woman thishas gone to her heart but she loves you still Olivia and will forgetit."_IV.--Fresh Calamities_It was late the next night when I approached my own home. I had leftOlivia at an inn five miles away intending to prepare my family for herreception. To my amazement I saw the house bursting out into a blaze offire and every aperture red with conflagration I gave a loudconvulsive outcry which alarmed my son and all my family ran out wildwith apprehension. Our neighbours came running to our assistance butthe flames had taken too strong a hold to be extinguished and all theneighbours could do was to stand spectators of the calamity. Theybrought us clothes and furnished one of our outhouses with kitchenutensils so that by daylight we had another though a wretcheddwelling to retire to.In the midst of this affliction our poor lost one returned to us. "Ahmadam" cried her mother "this is but a poor place to come to after somuch finery I can afford but little entertainment to persons who havekept company only with persons of distinction but I hope Heaven willforgive you."The unhappy victim stood pale and trembling unable to weep or to reply."I entreat woman" I said to my wife with severity in my voice andmanner "that my words may be now marked once for all. I have herebrought you back a poor deluded wanderer--her return to duty demands the
comment746,revival of our tenderness. The real hardships of life are now comingfast upon us let us not increase them by dissensions among each other.The kindness of Heaven is promised to the penitent and let ours bedirected by the example."My daughter's grief however seemed formed for continuing and herwretchedness was increased by the news that Mr. Thornhill was going tobe married to the rich Miss Wilmot who had formerly been betrothed tomy eldest son.On a morning of peculiar warmth for the season when we werebreakfasting out of doors Mr. Thornhill drove up in his chariotalighted and inquired after my health with his usual air offamiliarity."Sir" replied I "your present assurance only serves to aggravate yourbaseness.""My dear sir" returned he "I cannot understand what this means""Go" cried I. "Thou art a poor pitiful wretch and every way a liarbut your meanness secures you from my anger""I find" he said "you are bent upon obliging me to talk in a harshermanner than I intended. My steward talks of driving for the rent and itis certain he knows his duty. Yet still I could wish to serve you andeven to have you and your daughter present at my marriage.""Mr. Thornhill" replied I "as to your marriage with any but mydaughter that I never will consent to And though your friendship couldraise me to a throne or your resentment sink me to the grave yet wouldI despise both.""Depend upon it" returned he "you shall feel the effects of thisinsolence" and departed abruptly.On the very next morning his steward came to demand my annual rentwhich by reason of the accidents already related I was unable to pay.On the following day two officers of justice took me to the county gaol.There is no situation however wretched it seems but has some sort ofcomfort attending it and I found mine in the help and kindness of afellow-prisoner Mr. Jenkinson by name who was awaiting trial forseveral acts of cheating and roguery. I myself indeed had been one ofhis victims.The fortune of my family who were lodged in the town was wholly anddistressingly adverse. Olivia was ill and longed for me to make mysubmission to Mr. Thornhill by approving his marriage with Miss Wilmot.When I had been confined a fortnight Mr. Jenkinson brought me dreadfulnews--Olivia was dead And while yet my grief was fresh upon me my wifecame weeping to tell me that Sophia had been seized by ruffians andcarried off.The sum of my miseries thought I is now made up nor is it in thepower of anything on earth to give me another pang. Yet another awaitedme. My eldest son George to whom I had written went to ThornhillCastle to punish our betrayer he was attacked by the coward's servantsinjured one of them and was brought into the very prison where I wasconfined.The enemy of my family had now triumphed completely. My only hope was ina letter I had written to Sir William Thornhill telling him of themisdeeds of his nephew. I was by this time myself extremely ill. Isought to break from my heart all ties that bound it to earth and tofit myself for eternity._V.--The Rescue_On parting from my unhappy son who was removed to a stronger cell Ilaid me down in bed when Mr. Jenkinson entering informed me thatthere was news of my daughter. He had scarcely delivered his messagewhen my dearest girl entered with Mr. Burchell."Here papa" she cried "here is the brave man to whom I owe my
comment747,delivery to this gentleman's intrepidity--"A kiss from Mr. Burchell interrupted what she was going to add."Ah Mr. Burchell" said I "you were ever our friend. We have longdiscovered our errors with regard to you and repented our ingratitude.And now as you have delivered my girl if you think her a recompenseshe is yours.""But I suppose sir" he replied "you are apprised of my incapacity tosupport her as she deserves""I know no man" I returned "so worthy to deserve her as you."Without the least reply to my offer he ordered from the next inn thebest dinner that could be provided. While we were at dinner the gaolerbrought a message from Mr. Thornhill desiring permission to appearbefore his uncle in order to vindicate his innocence and honour. Thepoor harmless Mr. Burchell then was in reality the celebrated SirWilliam ThornhillMr. Thornhill entered with a smile and was going to embrace his uncle."No fawning sir at present" cried the baronet. "The only way to myheart is by the road of honour but here I only see complicatedinstances of falsehood cowardice and oppression."At this moment Jenkinson and the gaoler's two servants entered haulingin a tall man very genteelly dressed. As soon as Mr. Thornhill perceivedthe prisoner and Mr. Jenkinson he seemed to shrink backward withterror for this was the man whom he had put upon the carrying off ofSophia."Heavens" cried Sir William "what a viper have I been fostering in mybosom""As Mr. Thornhill and I have been old fellow-sporters" said Jenkinson"I have a friendship for him and I hope he will show a proper return offriendship to his own honest Jenkinson who brings him a wife."So saying he went off and left us."I am surprised" said the baronet "what he can intend by this""When we reflect" I replied "on the various schemes--Amazement Do Isee my lost daughter It is--it is my Olivia""As for you squire" said Jenkinson "this young lady is your lawfulwedded wife. Here is the licence to prove it. He commissioned megentlemen" he continued "to procure him a false licence and a falsepriest in order to deceive this young lady. What did I do but went andgot a true licence and a true priest. To my shame I confess it my onlydesign was to keep the licence and let the squire know that I couldprove it upon him whenever I wanted money.""How could you" I cried "add to my miseries by the story of herdeath""That" replied Jenkinson "is easily answered. I thought the onlyprobable means of freeing you from prison was by submitting to thesquire and consenting to his marriage with the other young lady. Butthis you had vowed never to grant while your daughter was living so Ihad to join with your wife in persuading you that she was dead."Mr. Thornhill's assurance had now entirely forsaken him. He fell on hisknees before his uncle and implored compassion."Thy vices crimes and ingratitude" said the baronet "deserve nocompassion but a bare competence shall be supplied thee and thy wifeshall possess a third part of that fortune which once was thine." Thenturning to Sophia he caught her to his breast with ardour. "I havesought" he cried "for a woman who a stranger to my fortune could
comment748,think I had merit as a man. How great must be my rapture to have made aconquest over such sense and such heavenly beauty"On the next day Sophia was wedded to Sir William Thornhill and my sonGeorge now freed from justice as the person supposed to be wounded byhim was detected to be an impostor led Miss Wilmot to the altar. Assoon as I had awakened that morning I had heard that my merchant hadbeen arrested at Antwerp and that my fortune had been restored to me.It may not be improper to observe with respect to Mr. Thornhill thathe now resides as companion at a relation's house. My eldest daughterhas told me that when he reforms she may be brought to relent.I had now nothing on this side of the grave to wish for. All my careswere over. It only remained that my gratitude in good fortune shouldexceed my submission in adversity.                                   EDMOND AND JULES DE GONCOURTRene Mauperin     Edmond de Goncourt born at Nancy on May 26 1822 and his     brother Jules born in Paris on December 17 1830 were     primarily artists who while wandering over France knapsack     on back discovered that their note-books also made them     writers. In 1850 they entered upon a literary partnership     which only finished with the death of the younger brother on     June 20 1870. Their earliest literary endeavours consisted of     a series of historical studies dealing with the France of the     second half of the eighteenth century. It was not until 1860     with the publication of their first novel "Les Hommes de     Lettres" that they discovered their true bent lay in fiction.     "Rene Mauperin" which is perhaps the best known of their     books was published in 1864. As a psychological analysis of     contemporaneous youth it is probably without its equal in     French fiction. "The plot of the story" wrote Edmond de     Goncourt "is secondary. The authors have rather preferred to     paint the modern young woman as she is the product of the     artistic and masculine system of education in force during the     last thirty years. We have also attempted to portray the     modern young college man influenced by the republican ideas of
comment749,     the time since Louis Philippe." Edmond de Goncourt died on     July 16 1896._I.--A Wayward Girl_"Yes I love riding and hunting. I never miss a meet. The wind blowingthrough one's hair the hounds the horns the trees flying past you--itis intoxicating In those moments I feel brave. Life has few otherpleasures for a well-brought-up girl like me. Everything is shocking Idance yes ... but do you think I am allowed to talk to my partner Yesno no yes--that's all That's proper. And I am allowed to read if thebooks and articles are proper. I paint in oils and that shocks myfamily a young lady must not go beyond copying roses in water-colours.Isn't the current strong here"Rene Mauperin and young Reverchon her parent's guest were swimming inthe Seine."How beautiful" exclaimed the girl as she noticed the evening sungilding the river and the banks where country and suburb merged intoeach other."You are an artist by nature mademoiselle.""Ouf" she exclaimed with a comic intonation.A boat approached."Well Rene how is the water" asked one of the rowers."Splendid thanks Denoisel" she replied as she mounted the stepslowered for her."I was almost getting nervous for you. And Reverchon Ah there he is"                                   Rene was the youngest daughter of a distinguished Napoleonic officerwho at the time of the revolution of 1830 was elected deputy andfought with all his ardour for the Liberal cause but who subsequentlyat the urging of his wife a tyrannical conventional member of the_bourgeois_ retired from the world of politics and established a sugarrefinery so as to be able to provide suitably for his three children.The first two a boy born in 1826 and a daughter in 1827 were adisappointment to the old soldier. They were too reasonable too"grown-up" before they were children but in Rene who was born afteran interval of eight years M. Mauperin found ample consolation. Hisheart revelled in her pranks and merry laughter and she grew up the petof her father whose affection she returned with all her heart. She wasnow twenty her brother Henri serious studious plodding anddetermined to make a career was a lawyer and had made some reputationby his articles on statistical subjects and Henriette her eldersister had found a husband in M. Davarande whose wealth and positionallowed her to devote herself to the life of empty amusement dividedmainly between long rounds of calls the opera and the Bois whichfilled the days of the moneyed Paris _bourgeoisie_ of that time.Madame Mauperin delighted with Henriette's match was anxious to findan equally suitable partner for Rene but the high-spirited girl had awill of her own and seemed to take almost a pleasure in crossing hermother's transparent matrimonial schemes. Quite a number of eligibleyoung men had been introduced to the house at La Briche--and had left itwithout having furthered their suit. Reverchon had now been invited withsimilar intentions and Rene was no more amenable than before. Whileher mother filled the young man's ears with praise of heraccomplishments the wayward girl with her charming ingenuous talk didher best to demonstrate her lack of those negative conventional virtuesthat were expected from a well-educated French girl in those days. Shemade Madame Mauperin turn first crimson then pale when she finallyproceeded to cut Denoisel's hair in the drawing-room after dinner.
comment750,Denoisel was the son of Mauperin's bosom friend who had fought by hisside in many battles and who on his death-bed had made him his son'sguardian. Mauperin became more than a guardian to the boy--he became hisfather. When Henri and Henriette were born it seemed to Denoisel thathe had been given a brother and sister but he adored the baby Reneand he alone succeeded in making her listen and obey."Sometimes" said Henri to Denoisel as they travelled back to Paris "mysister's follies are harmless enough but to-night ... before thatfellow ... I am sure the marriage will fall through. And such anexcellent match""You think so I began to fear for her. And that's why I lent myself toher prank. He is too hopelessly commonplace--a tailor's dummy He wouldnever have understood her. Your sister ought to marry a man ofintelligence and character."And Madame Mauperin as she prepared for bed lectured her husband uponacceding to all his favourite's whims."Another marriage missed Henri spoke to me this evening. He is sureReverchon will not have her.""Well what of it""Why he is the tenth Rene will get an awful reputation. She will seewhen she is thirty ... and you too." Then after a pause "And now aboutyour son. He is twenty-nine now. He at any rate has no objection tomarriage. Have you ever thought of finding him a suitable wife"She continued to talk and to grumble until Mauperin fell asleep."Henri is reasonable enough but he is a young man and you know thedanger. It's driving me mad What do you think of trying MadameRosires"There was no reply. Madame Mauperin resigned herself to silence andturned to find the sleep which only came with morning._II.--Plots and Plays_Next morning Madame Mauperin proceeded to Paris and drove to her son'sapartments in the Rue Taitbout. She found him at work. After somebeating about the bush she approached the object of her visit."I fear" she began "that you must have some reason for ...""For not marrying isn't it My dear mother you need not worry. I knowthat wealth is needed for a successful career and that the best andmost honourable way to obtain it is a good marriage. And I am determinedto make a career. I shall get married soon enough... and betterperhaps than you think."At La Briche meanwhile M. Mauperin vainly tried to be stern with hispet."I have done it purposely" she said."And why""Because I love you better than that young gentleman who was in no waysympathetic to me. You are ungrateful."
comment751,"But listen my dear child Fathers are egotists and would prefer tokeep their children. But I am old and I should not like to part withoutseeing you married a mother with affections that will replace mine.""Oh this is wicked Never never" she exclaimed "let me cry alone fora minute." And she left the room hurriedly.When she returned after a while she found Denoisel in the room."You have been out And where have you been""Well if you want to know I have been to church to pray that I may diebefore father. I knelt before a statue of the Virgin. And you maylaugh but it seemed to me that she nodded at my request. And it made mequite happy."The conversation drifted to gayer topics and the two soon fell intotheir wonted tone of banter. "Tell me Rene" said Denoisel "have younever felt I won't say love but some sentiment for anybody""Never. That sort of thing only occurs when the heart is empty. But whenit is defended by the affection one feels for a father--as a child Ifelt perhaps the beginning of that emotion of which one reads in novels.And do you know for whom""No.""For you. Oh only for a moment. I soon loved you differently for havingcorrected the spoilt child of its faults for having directed myattention to noble and beautiful things. And I resolved to repay you bytrue friendship."M. Mauperin entered the room and interrupted the confidences.A few days later Rene having set her mind upon playing in privatetheatricals a discussion arose about the filling of the second lady'spart in the play that had been chosen. One by one the names suggestedwere dismissed until Henri said "Why not ask Mlle. Bourjot They arejust staying at Sannois.""Nomi" replied Rene. "I'd love it. But she was so cold towards melast winter. I don't know why.""She will have 12000 a year" interrupted Denoisel "and her motherknows that you have a brother. And they are not a little proud of theirmoney."Twelve thousand a year Madame Mauperin thought of her son's future andsupported his suggestion. It was decided that they would call on theBourjots on Saturday.To Sannois they went as arranged on the Saturday. They were receivedwith effusion and had to put up for an hour or so with the unbearablearrogance of their hosts' display of wealth. Rene's warm advances tothe playmate of her childhood were received by Nomi with coolness notto say reluctance but the request that Nomi should take part in thetheatricals met with her mother's approval the shy girl's objections--nervousness lack of talent and so forth--being overruled by MadameBourjot. Before the two families parted it was arranged that Nomishould be taken by her governess to attend the rehearsals at theMauperins' house.Rene's whole-hearted friendliness and sparkling humour soon overcameNomi's reserve and under Denoisel's direction the amateur actors maderapid progress. Madame Bourjot herself came to one of the rehearsalsand after the first compliments expressed her surprise that Henri theprincipal actor was absent. "Oh he has a wonderful memory" said hisproud mother "two rehearsals will set him right."At last the great day arrived. A stage had been arranged in the largedrawing-room which was filled to its utmost capacity the ladies beingseated in the long rows of chairs the men standing behind andoverflowing through open doors into the adjoining rooms. The play chosenwas "The Caprice." Henri who revealed rare talent took the part of the
comment752,husband Nomi of the neglected wife. The curtain fell upon enthusiasticapplause and Madame Bourjot who had feared that her daughter would bea fiasco was delighted with her success. Amid the hum of voices sheheard the lady sitting next to her say to her neighbour "His sister Iknow ... but for the part he is not sufficiently in love with her ...and too much with his wife. Did you notice" she continued in awhisper.In the second piece Henri appeared as Pierrot Rene as the forsakenwife and Nomi as the beloved. Henri played with real passion. Fromtime to time his eyes seemed to search for Madame Bourjot's. Herneighbour felt her leaning against her shoulder. The curtain fell.Madame Bourjot swayed and fell back in a faint.She was carried to the garden."Leave me now" she said "I am all right now it was the heat. I onlywant a little air ... Let M. Henri stay with me."They were left alone."You love her" said Madame Bourjot clutching Henri's arm. "I knowall.... Have you nothing to say""Nothing. I have struggled for a year. I will not excuse myself. I oweyou the truth. I love your daughter it is true."Finally Madame Bourjot rose and walked towards the house. Henrifollowed."I count upon never seeing you again sir" she said without lookinground. With a mighty effort she regained her composure and walked backto the house on Henri's arm._III.--Stint to Death by his Sister_It was Madame Bourjot herself who insisted upon seeing Henri again andsince he did not answer her letter she went to his apartments. Theinterview was painful but she gave her consent to Henri's marriage withNomi and undertook to overcome M. Bourjot's possible objections oncondition that Henri should humour her husband's vanity by adopting atitle--an easy matter enough. The Mauperins had a farm calledVillacourt. Mauperin de Villacourt would do very well. Henri promised tosee what he could do.Madame Bourjot and her daughter called on the Mauperins next day. Thetwo girls were asked to leave their mothers to their talk and to take awalk in the garden."A secret" said Rene as soon as they were alone. "Can you guess it I
comment753,can--my brother. ... But you are crying. What is it my darling Nomi""Oh you don't know" her friend sobbed. "I cannot--if you onlyknew----Save me If I could only die""Die But why""Because your brother is----" She stopped in horror at what she wasabout to say then whispered the rest of her sentence into her ear andhid her face on her friend's bosom."You lie" Rene pushed her back."I" Rene did not reply but looked sadly and gently into Nomi's eyes.Rene doubted no longer. She was silent for a moment she felt almostthe duties of a mother towards this child.In the evening Henri was surprised to find his sister waiting in hisroom. She approached the subject of his impending marriage and imploredhim by his love for her not to give up his name and to break off thematch."Are you mad Enough of this"Rene fixed her eyes upon her brother."Nomi has told me--everything"Her cheeks flushed Henri turned deathly pale."My dear" he said with a shaky voice "you interfere in things whichdo not concern you. A young girl--" Then seizing her hand he pointedtowards the door and said "Go"Rene was ill for a week and Henri knowing the cause did his best toalleviate her suffering. Still a coldness remained between them. Heunderstood that she had forgiven the brother but not the man. One dayshe accompanied Henri to town and went with him to the Record Officewhere he had to make some inquiries about the legality of adopting hisown name. While he was questioning the keeper she overheard two clerksdiscuss her brother and his claim. "He thinks the Villacourt family isextinct. But he is misinformed although they have gone down in theworld. In fact I know the heir to the title--a M. Boisjorand with whomI once had a fight when we were boys. They lived in the forest of theCroix-du-Soldat near St. Mihiel at La Motte-Noire." Rene fixed thesenames in her mind."I have got all I want" said Henri gaily coming towards her. And theywent out together.The Bourjots were giving a great ball to celebrate the publicannouncement of the engagement of their daughter to M. Mauperin deVillacourt."You are enjoying yourself" said Rene to Nomi."I have never danced so much it is true." And Nomi took her arm anddrew her into a small salon. "No never." She kissed her. "Oh what itis to be happy She loves him no longer. I am sure of it--I can see itI feel it.""And you love him now"Nomi closed her mouth by pressing her lips upon Rene's. A young mancame to claim Nomi for the dance and Denoisel requested the samefavour from Rene.Denoisel was with Henri Mauperin. They were smoking and talkingpeacefully when the door was thrust open and a man forced his way inpushing aside the valet who wanted to prevent him from entering."M. Mauperin de Villacourt" he asked."That is my name" said Henri rising."Good. My name is Boisjorand de Villacourt" retorted the strangerstriking him so violently on the cheek that his face was immediatelycovered with blood. Henri conquered his first impulse to throw himselfupon the intruder and said calmly "You find that there is oneVillacourt too many--so do I. Leave your card with my servant. I shallsend to you to-morrow."It was from a marked number of the "Moniteur" which the impoverishedheir of the glorious name of De Villacourt found on his return from atwo years' sojourn in Africa that M. Boisjorand had learned that Henrihad taken from him this name which was all that had come down to himfrom his famous ancestors. He immediately proceeded to Paris and sought
comment754,legal advice but found that his poverty rendered legal actionimpossible. After his interview with the solicitor he went straight toHenri's apartment to obtain the only satisfaction that was in his power.Denoisel and another friend of Henri's arranged with Boisjorand'sseconds next morning the details of the meeting. Henri who was anexcellent shot had insisted on pistols at thirty-five paces eachcombatant to have the right to advance ten steps. The duel was to takeplace at four o'clock the same afternoon near the ponds of Villed'Avray.Neither of the two adversaries showed a trace of nervousness. The signalwas given M. De Villacourt advanced five steps Henri remainingstationary. At the sixth step Henri fired and his opponent fell. Henrihurried towards him."Back to your place" shouted the wounded man. On his hands and knees hecrawled forward to the limit of his advance leaving a trail of blood inthe snow. Then he took careful aim--and Henri fell with arms extendedand his face towards the ground._IV.--Broken Wanderers_To Denoisel fell the painful duty of informing Mauperin of his son'sdeath. The old man's grief was heartbreaking. When Denoisel was admittedto Rene he found her sitting on a footstool sobbing with herhandkerchief pressed to her mouth."Rene" he said taking her hands "he has been killed--that man shouldnever have known. He did not read he saw nobody he lived like awolf--he was not a subscriber to the 'Moniteur.' Some enemy must havesent him that paper."Rene had risen she moved her lips she wanted to scream "It was I"Then suddenly pressing her hand against her heart she fell senselesson the floor.                                   Rene did not seem to recover from her illness. Denoisel saw her dailybut a certain coldness had set in between them--he thought that Reneheld him responsible for not having prevented the duel while Renevaguely feared that Denoisel had guessed her secret. He started upon along journey.In those days of illness and anxiety the hearts of father and daughterseemed to come together more closely even than before. The heartbrokenold man saw his beloved child wasting away. He called in the bestspecialist from Paris who did not exactly give up all hope but did notconceal that Rene's life was in danger. The poor girl who could notbear to witness her father's misery put on a gay air assuring himagain and again that she was recovering. Indeed when at her urgingthe family removed to the country house where she had spent herchildhood there was a real and marked improvement and for a while theroses seemed to return to her pale cheeks.But she soon fell back into her listless state. Thus she lingered on forseveral months always cheering her father and speaking of her happyfuture always fading away until she became a mere shadow of her formerbright and healthy self. Only to Denoisel when after a long absence hereturned from the Pyrenees she opened her heart. To him she confessedthat she knew her days were counted.Those who travel far afield have perhaps met in foreign towns or amongthe ruins of dead places--now in Russia now in Egypt--two aged peoplea man and a woman who seem to march along without looking and withoutseeing. They are the Mauperins--father and mother.They have sold everything and have gone. Thus they wander from land toland from hotel to hotel. They wander trying to lose their grief inthe fatigue of the road dragging their weary life to all the corners ofthe globe.                                   JAMES GRANTBothwell     The author of "Bothwell" and many other romantic tales was a     Scotsman by birth parentage and perfervid sentiment. He was     born at Edinburgh on August 1 1822. His father was a     distinguished Highland officer by his mother he was related     to his illustrious literary exemplar Sir Walter Scott. He was     only twenty-three years of age when "The Romance of War" made     him one of the most famous authors of his day. Other tales     quickly followed including in 1853 "Bothwell or The Days     of Mary Queen of Scots" and it seemed as if readers could     not have too much of the lively adventure and vigorous
comment755,     historical portraiture to which Grant unfailingly treated     them. Altogether he wrote more than fifty novels many of them     involving considerable research. Grant outlived his     popularity the public sought new writers and when he died     on May 5 1887 he was penniless. For fertility of incident     rapid change of scene and skilful intermingling of historical     with imaginary people and events "Bothwell" is not surpassed     by any of the romances that came from its author's fertile     pen._I.--Anna of Bergen_Erick Rosenkrantz Governor of Aggerhuis in Norway and castellan ofBergen stood in the hall of his castle to welcome noble guests. It wasa bleak and stormy day in September of 1565. Ill indeed would it havefared with the newcomers had not Konrad of the Salzberg the youngcaptain of the crossbowmen of Bergen ventured forth on the raging seaat the peril of his life and piloted their vessel into safety.The first of these was a tall and handsome man about thirty years oldwith a peculiar dare-devil expression in his deep dark eye richlyattired and wearing a long sword and Scottish dagger. His companionwho deferentially remained a few paces behind was a man of giganticstature swarthy and dark in complexion with fierce and restless eyes."Sir Erick" began the chamberlain "allow me to introduce Sir JamesHepburn Earl of Bothwell a noble peer ambassador from Mary Queen ofScots to his Danish majesty.""We thank you for your gracious hospitality fair sir" said Bothwellwith a profound courtesy then turning to Konrad "And now braveyouth by whose valour we have been saved let me thank _you_."He warmly shook Konrad's hand while the youth tried to catch the eye ofAnna the governor's fair-haired and lovely niece. But Anna was toointently regarding the strangers.Suddenly Bothwell perceived her his colour heightened his eyessparkled."Anna--Lady Anna" he exclaimed "art _thou_ here When we parted at thepalace of King Frederick I feared it was to meet no more.""Thou seest my lord" she replied gaily "that fate never meant toseparate us altogether."It was Bothwell who sat by Anna's side at the banquet not Konrad herlover from childhood. Konrad was displaced and slighted he left thehall with a heart full of jealous and bitter thoughts."Dost thou not see the hand of fate in this meeting with Anna" saidBothwell when retiring to his gigantic companion Black Hob ofOrmiston the most merciless and ferocious of border barons."Nay" said Hob "I perceive only the finger of mischief"
comment756,"I own to thee" replied the earl "that all my old passion is revivedin full force. My whole heart and soul are hers" he went onpassionately."Remember your solemn plight to the Lady Jane Gordon. If that be brokenour doleful case will be worse than ever." For Bothwell was noambassador but an exile and his real mission to King Frederick was inpursuit of a design to hand over the northern Scottish isles to Denmarkand become viceroy of them."Hob be not insolent" retorted Bothwell. "I love her a thousand timesmore than Huntly's sickly sister."It was always thus with this reckless noble--the passion of the momentwas ever too strong for past pledges and future policy. While waiting atBergen for the ship to be repaired he wooed Anna with all the skill ofan accomplished man of pleasure.Anna's heart was ready to be won and it was not long ere Bothwellhaving gained her love asked Governor Rosenkrantz for her hand. To hismortification he was refused. Anna said the governor had long beenpledged to Konrad.But Konrad meanwhile was in despair. Anna no longer smiled upon himhe was lightly cast aside to make way for a more favoured lover. Oneevening he was missing. A day and a night passed and Konrad was nowhereto be seen. Search for him was useless--he had disappeared.Two letters were brought to Bothwell by a king's messenger. One was fromKing Frederick commanding him to desist from his mock embassy andinstantly leave the Danish seas the other from the Earl of Huntlytold him that his enemies in Scotland were banished and his forfeiturereversed.Bothwell's thoughts instantly turned to Anna. He knew that she would notaccompany him unless he married her and policy now more than everrequired that he should keep his troth to the sister of his friend theEarl of Huntly. Then there occurred to him the sinister thought of amock marriage.His actions were quick and his persuasions to the love-sick Annairresistible. That evening the two were wedded by a crazy hermit whodwelt among the rocks of the fjord and Anna without a word of farewellto her kin left her native land it might be for ever.A stormy voyage brought the ship to Westeray in Shetland. Bothwellescorted Anna to the castle of Noltland and as she landed at the piera young man sprang forward and helped her across the plank. She feltagitated she knew not why she looked at the man's face but it was
comment757,concealed. It was Konrad. He had fallen over a cliff had been carriedout to sea on a plank had been picked up by a ship which had carriedhim to Shetland and had taken service with the castellan of Noltland.The unexpected sight of Anna brought back his emotions to theirstarting-point and recalled the poignancy of the hour in which he hadrealised that he had lost her._II.--Bothwell Castle_"I have resolved" exclaimed the earl on the morning after theirarrival at Noltland. "I would be worse than mad to forego the prospectof power by marring my union with the sister of Huntly.""Cock and pie now thou speakest like a man of mettle" growled Hob."Anna is not my first love" mused the earl. "Have I not felt how feeblehave been my sentiments for Anna for Jane of Huntly for all who havesucceeded her whom I met in France long ago""Then thou wilt sail----""Yes like neas leaving my Dido behind me."With a pretence of the love he felt no longer Bothwell bade Annafarewell and left her to doubts which as the months went on and hispromise to return was not fulfilled gradually rose to despair.During the decline of a spring evening as Anna wandered dejectedly onthe battlements Konrad stood before her for the first time since herarrival at Noltland."Konrad" she faltered "thou here""Anna--dear Anna" exclaimed the unhappy young man. "I have tidings totell thee. The false lord of Bothwell hath been espoused to the sisterof Huntly""And I--" gasped Anna."Thou art a captive for life in this island castle"Anna would have fallen backwards had Konrad not sprung to herassistance."Listen" he said in a low voice. "If thou wouldst escape an hour willset thee free.""Yes land me once in Scotland and I will make my way to Bothwell."That night Anna was on a Norwegian vessel bound for Glasgow and Konradwas with her. She could not he knew be his bride but he could atleast protect and cherish her and strive to redress the wrongs she hadsuffered.A storm was gathering above the lovely valley of the Clyde one Juneevening as two strangers--a man and a woman--plodded wearily towardsBothwell Castle. The woman became wholly exhausted the man laid hergently down in shelter among the ruins of Blantyre Priory and went onhis errand alone. The storm had now burst and the river was rising
comment758,rapidly but Konrad--for it was he--plunged into the raging waters andstrove to swim across. The current was too strong for him he clung toan ash tree that projected over the stream and was nearly exhaustedwhen a man on the bank flung down his mantle and poniard plunged inand dragged him to the shore.Konrad almost senseless was carried within the castle. When he hadrevived and was dressed in dry garments he was brought before hisrescuer--it was Bothwell himself."I thank thee" said Konrad proudly "for saving my life.""Thou didst save mine. We are now equal" replied the earl."'Tis well I would not be _thy_ debtor for all the silver in the minesof Bergen Lord of Bothwell I tell thee in thine own hall that thou arta dishonoured villain""Thou art stark mad" cried the earl. Then he went on "Konrad I havewronged thee deeply. In my youth I loved one who neglected me as cruellyas thou hast been neglected and since then a mischievous spirit ofvengeance as it were has led me to make women my playthings to be wonand thrown aside. I love thy spirit Konrad. If I could be thy friend----""Never" cried Konrad. "I come not for friendship but for justice toAnna Hast thou not wedded another after thine espousal of her""Dost thou deem the mock blessing of yon mad hermit a spousal rite"exclaimed the earl laughing.Konrad repressed his passion."I go to push my fortune with your turbulent border chiefs and if inthe strife that will soon convulse this land thou meetest Konrad ofSalzberg look well to thyself""Go thy way and God be with thee" replied the earl. "Thou art thefirst who hath bent a dark brow on a lord of Bothwell under his ownroof-tree."Konrad returned to Anna and in the ruined priory told her how Bothwellwas false to her. Anna's grief was dreadful to behold."Anna" said Konrad after a pause "Scotland hath a queen whosegoodness of heart is revered in every land save her own.""True and at her feet will I pour forth my sorrow and my tearstogether."So the two traversed the thickets around the priory and reached thebroad highway which was to lead them at length to Edinburgh._III.--Mary Queen of Scots_But it was long ere Anna looked upon the face of the queen. At the RedLion Inn in Edinburgh her beauty struck the eye of the Earl of Mortonthe factious proud and ferocious associate of Moray in all the darkintrigues of that craftiest of Scottish statesmen. Morton promised thatAnna should be entrusted to a lady of fair repute and soon presented tothe queen. Konrad trusted him little knowing that the repute of DameAlison Craig Anna's new guardian was anything but fair and set forthfor the Border.It was to Sir John Elliot of Park that he offered the service of hissword for it was against this turbulent borderer who had just raidedNorthumberland and threatened the peace of the two kingdoms thatBothwell was advancing with the army of Queen Mary. Now garrisoning somesolitary peel-tower now hiding in some unfathomed cavern now issuingwith uplifted lance from the haggs of some deep moss Konrad engagedwith ardour in every desperate foray and his daring made him the idolof the wild spirits around him. In every deed of arms one thought was inhis mind--to come within a lance-length of Bothwell.Long and fierce was the struggle but it ended as a fight so unequal wasbound to end. John of Park was slain refusing with his dying breath tosurrender and Konrad was carried a half-senseless captive toBothwell's castle of Hermitage. Even then the earl spared his life. Helay in a hideous den in pitch darkness and dead silence broken only bythe splash of drops of fetid water that fell from the slimy arch of thevault.No token reached him of what was happening above and an event happenedthere that had vast influence on Bothwell's future. Across the hills toHermitage rode the Queen of Scots herself. The sight of her stirred inBothwell's heart an emotion he had never wholly conquered for she Maryherself was his first love of the bygone days in France. He had begunto realise that he loved her still he knew the coldness of her
comment759,relations with the dissolute and unfaithful Darnley her husband nowshe had come to Hermitage."Jesu Maria" cried the queen as Bothwell with beating heart pausedin the conversation. "Have you lost your tongue""Nay madame--my heart.""That is very serious but search for another.""I want no other" replied the earl in a trembling voice "but_thine_""Lord Bothwell" she said with a hauteur that froze her admirer "thouart in a dream.""Pardon me I pray you--""I do pardon thee" replied the queen with a calm smile but addedsignificantly "I think 'tis time I was riding from Hermitage."So ended the famous visit to Hermitage which was interpreted throughoutScotland as a token of Mary's love for her favourite earl.Konrad a month afterwards was sent to Edinburgh and confined in theold tower of Holyrood awaiting trial as a Border outlaw. Bothwellhimself soon followed and celebrated his return by a wild revel incompany with Hob of Ormiston and other choice spirits.As the revellers wandered through the narrow streets at midnightseeking a quarrel they passed the house of Dame Alison Craig."My page tells me" said Bothwell "there is a famous foreign beautyconcealed there. Ho within"A stoup of water poured on them from an upper window was the answer.They broke open the door and forced the shrieking dame to lead them tothe apartment where the foreign beauty was hidden."Death and confusion" muttered the earl when he saw who was within."Cock and pie" said Ormiston. "We have started the wrong game."Hastily they thrust back their companions. But Anna had recognised him.When Morton had made advances towards her she had repulsed himscornfully telling him she was the Countess of Bothwell. Morton hadseized on this opportunity of injuring a man he hated and resolved tobring Anna before the queen. Bothwell now knew the danger before himand prepared for it.Next day as the queen sat with her grim lords in council Morton led inAnna."I have the pleasure" said he "to present a lady who accuseth the Earlof Bothwell of wedding and ignobly deserting her.""'Tis false Lord Earl" cried Bothwell."Oh madam hear my story and condemn me not unheard" pleaded Anna."Let her speak for herself" said Mary.Thus encouraged Anna in moving accents told her story."A meloncholy tale in sooth" said Mary "but what proof is there""Your majesty" said Bothwell "this is the invention of some unknownenemy"--he glanced at Morton--"to deprive me of your royal favour. Letthis frantic damsel be removed to a Danish vessel now at Leith andconveyed to her home.""Well so be it" replied the facile queen.Anna drew herself up to her full height."Farewell Bothwell" she cried. "In that dark time of ruin and regretthat is coming upon thee remember Anna"And as she spoke they hurried her away.Bothwell henceforth was more than ever in the queen's favour. Only thelife of Darnley intervened between him and the goal of his love andambition and the sinister promptings of Ormiston suggested that eventhat obstacle was not irremovable._IV.--The Kirk of Field_On a dark winter night a conference of nobles was held at Whittinghame.Mary had been asked to divorce her husband and had proudly andindignantly refused. Only one way remained. A solemn bond was drawn upamong the assembled nobles and the bond sealed the fate of Darnley. Itwas not without doubt and shrinking that Bothwell saw whither hisschemes were leading him but he would not he could not turn back.It was at Ormiston's suggestion that Konrad was employed as anunconscious tool in the affair. Ormiston hinted that with a littleadroitness the whole blame might be laid on the unhappy prisoner. Konradaccordingly on the night when the deed was to be done was awakenedfrom a reverie in his cell at Holyrood by the entry of a tall maskedfigure."If thou wouldst attain liberty follow me" said Ormiston for it washe.He put a sword in Konrad's hand. Konrad as he grasped the weapon felthis spirits rise again and he followed.Presently they came to a group of masked men and silently the partywent through a private door in the city walls. Their destination though
comment760,Konrad knew it not was the lonely house of the Kirk of Field whereDarnley was lying slowly recovering from small-pox--an illness throughwhich the queen forgetting her wrongs at his hands had tenderly nursedhim.Konrad arrived at the house helped to unload a horse of heavy packageswhich he conjectured to contain plunder but it was gunpowder that heunwittingly handled.Suddenly a piercing cry came from above. A moment later the startledKonrad perceived Bothwell his mask awry his eyes glazed and haggard."Thou hast done well" said Ormiston grimly."Well My God" groaned the earl."Away while I fire the train" shouted Ormiston.Like a fiery serpent the train glowed along the ground. Then red andlurid in the shadowy night there flashed a volume of dazzling lightthen came a roar as if the earth was splitting.Konrad fled in bewildered terror and wandered about the outskirts ofthe city until in a little ruined chapel on the verge of a moor he laydown exhausted and fell asleep.In the morning he was awakened by a rough grasp on his shoulder."We have meshed one of the knaves at least" said a stern voice. Konradfound himself amidst knights and men-at-arms and he was led back to thecity.The citizens were in arms furious at the outrage of the night before.The appearance of a suspected murderer aroused their passion to theutmost Konrad's escort was overpowered and thrust aside. "Awa' wi' himto the Papist's pillar" cried a voice. Down they went with him to theNorth Loch and tied him there to an oaken stake about five feet deep inthe water--a spot where many a luckless Catholic had perished. The mobretired and Konrad was left alone helpless and to die.Bothwell sat by the fire in his apartments at Holyrood with knit browsand muttering lips the word he muttered was "Murderer." The shriek ofthe man whose death-blow he had struck still echoed in his ears.Presently there entered the room one of his followers Hepburn ofBolton."The Norwegian hath been bound to the Papist's pillar" said he "and bythis time he must be dead for it rains heavily and the loch fillsfast.""One other life" said the earl gloomily. "By heaven Bolton if I cansave him--come"In the darkness and the rain with the water rising around him Konradwaited for death. A sound of oars roused him from the stupefaction intowhich he had fallen. "Here here His head is above water still" said avoice. The bonds were cut Konrad was dragged into the boat and taken toland and offered a draught that revived him."Here we part" said the voice. "Give him dry garments and take him tothe Norwegian vessel and bid him cross my path no more""Who art thou" asked Konrad feebly."Thy greatest enemy James Earl of Bothwell"Slowly Konrad mounted the horse that had been brought for him and withdifficulty he rode but the morning saw him on board a vessel of Bergenin the hands of countrymen and friends.Bothwell was tried for the murder of Darnley and triumphantlyacquitted. He procured the secret assent of the nobles to his marriagewith Mary he divorced the Countess Jane one more vigorous action andthe goal would be attained.On an April day as Mary rode along the Stirling road towards Edinburghher way was barred by a thousand armed horsemen in close array andBothwell riding up requested that she should accompany him to hiscastle of Dunbar. It was useless to resist. Once in the castle Bothwelloffered her his hand and was proudly refused."Lord Earl" cried Mary "thou mayest tremble when I leave Dunbar""Madame" he replied "thou shalt never leave Dunbar but as the bride ofBothwell"In May Mary and Bothwell were married. A month later Bothwell fledbefore the wrath of an outraged nation never to see Mary again andwithin a week of their parting he roamed a pirate on the northern seas._V.--Nemesis_A large Danish war vessel approached the port of Bergen with prisonersto hand over to the castellan--the new castellan for old ErickRosenkrantz was dead. Chief of the captives was Bothwell nonchalant butmelancholy pale and more thoughtful than formerly still in pleasure
comment761,and in sorrow was he haunted by the shriek of the dying Darnley.Near him stood one who was not a captive but a returning wanderer.Konrad had again crossed the path of the earl his vessel long detainedin port and afterwards delayed by storms had been captured by theScottish pirate ship and he had been rescued from this new misfortuneby the great Norwegian war vessel.The prisoners were escorted to the hall of the castle and Bothwellassumed his most defiant look. The arras that concealed the das waswithdrawn and Bothwell looked upon the face of the hereditary castellanof Bergen Anna RosenkrantzOn seeing the earl she turned pale as death. The earl recoveredinstantly from his surprise and bowed smilingly."Well madam" said he "we foresaw not this meeting""Dost thou know" replied Anna firmly "that thy life and liberty are inmy power""I am assured" he answered "that they could not be in safer keeping.""Regicide and betrayer" return Anna with flashing eyes "from thishour thou shalt have meted out to thee the stern measures thou hast soruthlessly dealt to others. This man" she went on turning to thecaptain of the war ship "is the king's prisoner away with him to theCastle of Kiobenhafen--be under sail before sunset"Red-bearded Danish bowmen crowded round the earl who thus passed awayto the wretched captivity that ended only with his death ten yearsafterwards.Konrad unnoticed and uncared for stood alone in the hall where he hadonce been so welcome a guest. He had no intention of remaining in aplace where all was so changed but ere he turned to leave it for everhe paused a moment irresolutely. Once more the arras was withdrawn andAnna stood before him."I heard thou wert here Konrad" she said with a blushing cheek."Wouldst thou go without one word to me"She seated herself in the recess of a window. "I have long wished" shefaltered "to see thee once more. I have now seen the worth and faith ofthy heart when contrasted with mine own and I blush for my weakness--mywickedness--my folly. Thou mayest deem this unwomanly--indelicate butin love we are equal and why may not one make reparation as the other""Anna" said Konrad in a choking voice "though my heart be soured andsaddened my first sentiment for thee hath never altered. For all thouhast made me endure I forgive thee and I pray that thou mayest behappy. Anna--dearest Anna--I am going far away for I have doomed myselfto exile but I still regard thee as a sister--as a friend. All isforgotten and forgiven. And now farewell"He felt the hand of Anna in his another moment and she sank upon hisbreast."Oh Konrad" she whispered "if my heart is still prized by thee it isthine as in the days of our first love."And borne away by his passion the forgiving Konrad pressed the womanhe loved closer and closer to his breast.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The World's Greatest Books Vol IV.by Editors Arthur Mee and J.A.

MAXWELL GRAYThe Silence of Dean Maitland     Mary Gleed Tuttiett the gifted lady who writes under the     pseudonym of "Maxwell Gray" was born at Newport Isle of     Wight. The daughter of Mr. F.B. Tuttiett M.R.C.S. she began     her literary career by contributing essays poems articles     and short stones to various periodicals. With the appearance     of "The Silence of Dean Maitland" in 1886 Maxwell Gray's     name was immediately and permanently established in the front     rank of living novelists. The story and its problem     dramatically set forth and with rare literary art became one     of the most discussed themes of the day. Since that time     Maxwell Gray has produced a number of stories among them     being "The Reproach of Annesley" 1888 "The Last Sentence"     1893 "The House of Hidden Treasure" 1898 and "The Great
comment769,     Refusal" 1906 and also several volumes of poems. This     little version of "The Silence of Dean Maitland" has been     prepared by Miss Tuttiett herself._I.--Impending Tragedy_The story opens on a grey October afternoon in the Isle of Wight in the'sixties. Alma Lee the coachman's handsome young daughter is toilingup a steep hill overlooking Chalkburne tired and laden with parcelsfrom the town. As she leans on a gate Judkins a fellow-servant of herfather's drives up in a smart dog-cart and offers her a lift home. Sherefuses scornfully to the young groom's mortification he drives offhurt by her coquetry and prophesying that pride goes before a fall.Then a sound of bells is heard--a waggon drawn by a fine bell-teamclimbs the hill and stops by Alma. She accepts the waggoner's offer ofa lift and on reaching the gate of her home in the dusk is distressedby his insistence on a kiss in payment when out of the tree-shadowssteps Cyril Maitland the graceful and gifted son of the rector ofMalbourne newly ordained deacon.He rebukes the waggoner rescues Alma and escorts her across a field toher father's cottage. There he is welcomed with respectful affection asthe rector's son and Alma's former playmate. Afterwards she lights himto the gate where a chance word of his evokes from her an innocent andunconscious betrayal of her secret love kindling such strong responsein him as he cannot conquer except by touching a letter in his breast-pocket. This letter is from Marion Everard to whom he has been a yearengaged.He walks through the dark to Malbourne Rectory where by the fire hefinds his invalid mother his twin sister Lilian and two youngerchildren. Here he appears the idol of the hearth--genial gracefulgifted beautiful and warm-hearted. But he betrays ambition sudden andgreat haste to be married and some selfishness. He walks to his lodgingin a neighbouring village where trifling circumstances point to arefined sensuousness self-indulgence and sophistry in his characterleading to the neglect of serious duty. The shadow of impending tragedyis hinted at from the first line of the book.December in the following year. Cyril now an East End curate and HenryEverard M.D. going by rail to Malbourne. Everard asleep manlycheerful intellectual healthy in body and mind. Cyril awake consumedby unspeakable sorrow. Everard wakes Cyril suddenly becomes gay inresponse to his friend's high spirits. They chaff each other. Cyrilpreaches to Everard when Henry scolds him for fasting and his laxityof faith and practice. They pass Belminster when Cyril betraysunconscious ambition at Everard's jesting prophecy that he would preachas bishop in the cathedral. Asceticism is defended by Cyril andcondemned by Everard. Cyril speaks of the discipline of sorrow andpresses a spiked cross under his clothes into his side. Everard exaltsthe discipline of joy. The friends have been privately educatedtogether and were together at Cambridge. Henry admires Cyril'scharacter and mental brilliance Cyril regards Henry with condescendingaffection. Everard is silently in love with Lilian.Cyril and Everard in the meantime have arrived at Malbourne Rectory.Cyril and Marion who have not met since a quarrel are alone together.She wonders that he makes so much of the little tiff. He talks of hisunworthiness and makes her promise to cleave to him through good and_evil_ report. At dinner Everard asks for all the villagers andgathers that Alma Lee is disgraced. "Alma little Alma the child we
comment770,used to play with" he cries afterwards to the men Maitlands. "Who isthe scoundrel" Cyril grows impatient under the discussion that follows."After all _she is not the first_" he says at last to Everard'sindignation.Sunday. All classes meeting on the way to church when Cyril preachesfor the first time to his friends and neighbours who throng to hearhim. He preaches with passionate earnestness upon the beauty ofinnocence and the agony of losing it. "That once lost" he says "theold careless joy of youth never returns."The village parliament in the moonlit churchyard after service commentwith humour on the sermon and on Cyril's eloquence learning and goodheart. Granfer the village oracle prophesies that the queen will makea bishop of him. Ben Lee talking with Judkins by the harness-room firesupposes that Cyril was thinking of Alma in his sermon. "He always had akind heart." But Judkins speaks of his suspicions of Everard as Alma'sbetrayer alludes to his frequent visits to Mrs.Lee during her illness some months ago and his constant meeting withAlma. Lee is convinced of Everard's guilt. "I'll kill him" he criesfuriously._II.--Sin-Engendered Sin_It is a lovely winter's day and Cyril Lilian and Everard are walkingthrough the woods at the back of Lee's cottage. Cyril puts somethinginto a hollow tree and intimates a chaffinch's call. Another birdreplies. Cyril walks on to Oldport leaving Everard and Lilian betweenwhom there follows a warm love scene and betrothal. During this episodeMrs. Lee Alma's stepmother tells her husband that Alma is gone to meether unknown lover in the wood at the signal of a chaffinch's call. Leefollows and finds Alma there _alone_. He picks up a paper she had tornand dropped it contains an assignation for that evening at dusk. Beforeluncheon Everard changes the grey suit he was wearing and had stainedin a muddy ditch. He goes to a lonely cottage on the downs in theafternoon returning in the evening he gets a black eye while rompingwith little Winnie Maitland. After bathing the eye he sponges thestained suit and is surprised to find blood on it. Cyril has been
comment771,absent in Oldport all day and on his return goes to bed with aheadache speaking to nobody. A man in Henry's grey suit passes throughthe hall at dusk followed by the cat who never runs after anyone butLilian and Cyril.That evening New Year's eve there is a gay party of rustics at thewheelwright's house. In the midst of Granfer's best story in rushesGrove the waggoner crying that Ben Lee had just been found murdered inthe wood. The same night Alma gives birth to a son.Next day Cyril in great mental anguish goes to Admiral Everard'shouse and incidentally puts to a brother clergyman there a case ofconscience Should a man who has acted unwisely and is guilty ofunintentional homicide imperil a useful and brilliant career byconfession Not if he had such great gifts and opportunities of doinggood as Cyril has he is told. By this pronouncement and a love scenewith Marion Cyril is much comforted.In the meantime Ben Lee's death is by many being imputed to Everardwho is quite unconscious of these suspicions. He is much surprised atthe appearance of policemen at the rectory that afternoon and stillmore so at being arrested on the charge of murdering Lee.After due examination Everard is committed for trial on the charge ofmurder. His best witness Granfer who had seen and spoken with him inthe village at the moment of the alleged murder greatly discredited hisevidence by his circumlocution and stupidity purposely affected to setthe court in a roar. He admitted that Everard gave him money andtobacco. Judkins swore that at three o'clock Lee told him Everard hadasked Alma to meet him at dusk that evening in the wood and thathe--Lee--meant to follow Everard there and exact reparation from himthat Alma and Everard were known to be together in the wood on themorning of Lee's death when Everard was with Lilian and that hehimself had seen them meet often clandestinely in the spring during Mrs.Lee's illness when letters books and flowers had passed between them.On the eve of Lee's death he had seen Everard go into the copse at duskcarrying a heavy stick.Ingram Swaynestone Grove the waggoner and Stevens the Sexton allsaw Everard going on the upland path to Swaynestone. But the blacksmithswore to seeing him in the village street at the same hour. A keeper sawhim going to the copse at the same time that a shepherd met him on thedown going in another direction. At five o'clock two rectory maids sawEverard run in by the back door and upstairs followed by the cat hemade no reply when Miss Maitland spoke to him. An hour later Everardasked the cook for raw meat for a black eye which he said he got byrunning against a tree in the dark. Blood was found in a basin in hisroom and on the grey suit which was much stained and torn as if by astruggle. A handkerchief of Everard's was found in the wood also astick he had been seen with in the morning.Everard's evidence at the inquest was that he left Malbourne Rectoryabout four wearing a black coat met the blacksmith in the village andthe shepherd on the down and finding the cottage on the down emptyreturned seeing no one till he met Granfer at Malbourne Cross andreached the rectory at six where a romp with Winnie Maitland gave himthe black eye that he promised her not to speak about. He could notaccount for the blood found on his clothes.Cyril is much shocked by the verdict and committal of Everard but issure that he will be cleared. "He must be cleared" he says "_at anycost_." Pending the assize trial he baptises three unknown babes inMalbourne Church. When asking the name of one of the children in hisarms he is told "Benjamin Lee." His evident deep emotion at this evokes
comment772,sympathy from all present. During the trial at Belminster he has a greatspiritual conflict in the cathedral while a fugue of Bach's is played onthe organ suggesting a combat between the powers of evil and good. Buthe feels that he _cannot_ renounce his brilliant prospects. Coming outhe hears that Alma has declared Everard is the man who was with herfather when he met his death in the struggle she heard while outside thecopse.Cyril at once rushes to the court which he had only left for an hourjust in time to hear the verdict "Manslaughter.""Stop" he cries. "I have evidence--the prisoner is innocent"The judge not understanding what he says orders his removal hisfriends thinking him distracted persuade him to be quiet while theutmost sentence--twenty years--is given. On hearing this Cyril with aloud cry falls senseless. He remains in delirium many weeks. A patheticfarewell between Henry and Lilian who is the only believer in hisinnocence and who renews her promise to him closes the first part.The tragedy faintly foreshadowed from the first line and graduallydeveloped from Cyril's self-righteousness and irrepressible joy inAlma's unguarded betrayal of unconscious passion has darkened the wholestory. Sin has engendered sin. Cyril's noble purpose to devote himselfentirely to his high calling and be worthy of it has become pitilessambition.His self-respect spiritual pride and egoism his ready tact socialcharm and power of psychological analysis subtle sophistry andself-deception his warmest affection disguised self-love his finestqualities perverted lead to his lowest fall.His weak and belated attempt to right Alma's wrong has killed herfather. Alma's desecrated love has turned to fierce idolatry layingwaste Lilian's happiness and working Henry's complete ruin. Cyril'scowardice has delayed clearing his friend till it is too late to savehim.    Not poppy not mandragora    Nor all the drowsy syrups of the worldwill ever medicine again to him that sweet sleep he had before hisguilt._III.--The Darkness of a Prison_A summer Sunday two years later. Alma and her child in a cornfieldlistening to bells ringing for Cyril's homecoming with his bride. Allthe softness and youth gone from Alma's tragic face and the last gleamsof penitence from her heart since her perjury. Jealousy is promptingher to go and tell Marion all. But Judkins comes and interrupts thesewild thoughts. He offers marriage rehabilitation and a home inAmerica. She hesitates. She is shunned by all and can get no work inMalbourne but has not been destitute money has found its waymysteriously to her cottage. So for the child's sake she accepts.Tea on the rectory lawn. Lilian is thinking of the prisoner Lenniewondering aloud "How does Alma _like_ having to go to hell for lyingabout Henry" Cyril is terribly agitated at this. He has scarcely yetrecovered from his long mental illness after Henry's sentence. Marion is_not happy_--she may never allude to Henry. The slightest reference tohim makes Cyril ill. Later in the moonlight Ingram Swaynestone asksLilian whom he has always loved to marry him. He cannot believe thatshe is secretly engaged to Henry. She points towards Henry's prison. "Iam all that man has on earth and I love him" she says.Nine years later. Convicts pulling down the old walls of Portsmouth. Anofficer's funeral passes by. No. 62--Henry--overhears people speaking ofthe manner of the officer's death and his name Major Everard. Tearsfall on the convict's hands as he works. No. 62's father is portadmiral. Alma's perjury in court had revealed all to Henry and reduced
comment773,him to apathetic despair. "There is no God--no good anywhere" he cried.But in time Lilian's periodic letters gave him heart and hope and hehad accepted his fate bravely trying to lift up and cheer his fellow-prisoners. In the darkness and uproar of a thunderstorm he escapes fromthe guarded works. His adventures during which he comes accidentallyand unrecognized in contact with his brother's widow his sister andher children who prattle of family matters in his hearing and after afew weeks' wandering by his being recaptured while lying on theroadside unconscious from hunger and exhaustion. This part of the storyconcludes with the reception of this news by Lilian and Cyril whoseunintentional neglect has caused the miscarriage of a letter that wouldhave enabled Henry to escape._IV.--"I Will Confess my Wickedness"_Everard is free and wearing the grey suit of a discharged prisoner istravelling from Dartmoor to London by train. Marion his brotherLeslie Mrs. Maitland and the admiral are all dead. Everything isstrange and changed to him. Liberty is sweet and bitter. He isprematurely aged and broken down the great future that had been beforehim is now for ever impossible. His still undeveloped scientifictheories and discoveries have been anticipated by others. He feels theprison taint upon him he will not see Lilian until it is removed andhe has become accustomed to the bewilderment of freedom.After a few days' pause he starts from London for Malbourne stopping atBelminster through which he had made his last free journey with Cyrilwhen he told him that "an ascetic is a rake turned monk." Passing thegaol in which he had suffered so much he goes to the cathedral. He askswho is now Dean of Belminster.The verger is surprised. "Where have you been sir not to have heard ofthe celebrated Dean Maitland" The great dean The books he has writtenthe things he has done All the world knows Dean Maitland the greatestpreacher in the Church of England.The deanery interior. Cyril charming and adored as ever is consideringwhether he shall accept the historic bishopric of Warham. A strangeyouth from America is announced and asks the dean to give him auniversity education--"because I am your son." "Since when" returns thedean tranquilly "have you been suffering from this distressingillusion" The youth bears a letter from Alma. She is dying inBelminster and implores him to come to her. She cannot die she writestill she has cleared Everard. After this terrible scene Cyril is inagony and nearly commits suicide. "But one sin in a life so spotless"he moans. The same evening Everard overwhelmed with accounts of Cyril'sgood deeds and spiritual counsels and examining with mingled awe andpity the numerous books he has written goes to hear one of the AnglicanChrysostom's lectures to working men in the cathedral.The music heard by Cyril during his mental conflict there years beforeis being played. Cyril thinks Lee's death and Henry's suffering the workof Fate since in wearing Everard's clothes he had no thought ofimpersonating him but only of avoiding the publicity of clerical dressnor had he dreamed of meeting or of struggling with Ben Lee. Meaning to
comment774,go to Alma who is already dead later on that night Cyril preachesupon the sin of Judas with great power and passion. "I charge you mybrothers beware of _self-deception_" Everard pities him he feels thathis own eighteen years' sufferings were nothing in comparison withCyril's secret tortures. Suddenly the preacher stops with a low cry ofagony. He has caught Everard's eye. He wishes the cathedral would falland crush him. "I am not well" he says leaving the pulpit. Everardwrites him a letter that night saying he has long known and forgivenall he asks Cyril to use his own secret repentance and unspoken agonyfor the spiritual help of others.The dean receives and reads the letter at breakfast next morning. Hethen shuts himself alone in his study for several hours. Then he takesleave of his blind son and only surviving daughter--all the otherchildren died in infancy--and sends them away to a relative. Everardafter waiting vainly for Cyril's answer goes to Malbourne. He travelsin the same carriage as the judge who had sentenced him and tells himthat he was innocent but is unable to clear himself. Nobody recogniseshim at Malbourne. He hears his case discussed at the village inn wherehe stops an hour too much agitated to go to the rectory. "He never doneit" is the general verdict.Then follows the pathetic meeting of Henry and Lilian. Mr. Maitland hadgradually ceased to believe in his guilt. "But I could never forgive theman who let you suffer in his stead" he says. Lilian shudders at this.Cyril is discussed. "Our dear Chrysostom our golden-mouth"Next day Sunday old friends welcome Everard. He has a great receptionfrom the villagers. Lilian presses him to say who was the guilty man.Mark Antony the cat is still alive. "Only once did Mark make amistake" she says "when he ran after _that grey figure in the dusk_.Else he never ran after any but myself and Cyril. Henry you _know_ whokilled Ben Lee. Tell me" she sobs "oh tell me it was not _he_" Henrycannot tell her. Lilian is deeply distressed. "His burden was heavierthan mine" Henry says. He comforts her.The same day at morning prayer Cyril enters the cathedral. The organis playing Mendelssohn's "O Lord have mercy upon me" The cathedral ispacked with people of all degrees known and unknown friends andstrangers. The thought that all these will soon know his shame turnsCyril sick. The faces of all those he has injured rise and reproach him.He goes through another great spiritual conflict but his soul emergesat last stripped of all pretence in the awful presence of his Makershuddering with the shame of its uncovered sin and alone. He nerveshimself to an effort beyond his strength as he stands in the pulpitbefore the innumerable gaze of the vast congregation by holding Henry'sletter as a talisman in his hand. Thus he preaches his last and greatestsermon. "I will confess my wickedness and be sorry for my sin." This hedoes literally. He tells the whole story in detail but without namessometimes unable to go on for agony and shame sometimes with tearsstreaming from his eyes. He tells it there that all may take warningfrom him. He intends to give himself up to justice as soon as possible.He does not spare himself. Since his first sin he says "I have not hadone happy hour." He never repented though always consumed with remorseuntil his friend forgave him. "That broke my stony heart" he says. Thecongregation are deeply moved and horrified. Many think he is under adelusion caused by sorrow for his friend and mental strain. Havingfinished in the usual way he sat down in the pulpit and neither spokenor moved again. There he was found later dead.Next day Henry who deeply moved has watched by the dead body of thedean in his library has to break the news of Cyril's death to Mr.Maitland in the very room in which Mr. Maitland had accused him ofCyril's crime and given him up to the police. The adoring father's mindgives way under the blow his memory is permanently confused and he
comment775,lives tranquilly on for some years in the belief that Cyril has onlygone away for a few days.The story ends with a family scene by Lake Leman where Henry andLilian happily married are living for a time with Mr. Maitland andCyril's children whom Henry has kept from knowing their father's guilt.                                   GERALD GRIFFINThe Collegians     Gerald Griffin born at Limerick on December 12 1803 was one     of the group of clever Irishmen who in imitation of Tom     Moore sought literary fame in London in the first quarter of     the nineteenth century. At the age of twenty he was writing     tales of Munster life. In 1829 he became popular through the     tale of "The Collegians" here epitomised--a tale that has     held the stage to the present day under the title of "The     Colleen Bawn." Nine years later Griffin renounced literature     returned to Ireland and entered the Church and on June 12     1840 died in a monastery at Cork. A tragedy written in his     early days was produced successfully by Macready after     Griffin's death. His fame however depends on his pictures of     Irish life and they are concentrated best in the literary     accessories of the present melodrama._I.--A Secret Wife_At a pleasure garden on a hill near Limerick Eily O'Connor thebeautiful daughter of Mihil O'Connor the rope-maker first met HardressCregan a young gentleman fresh from college and on the same night asshe and her father were returning homeward they were attacked by arabble of men and boys and rescued by the stranger and his hunchbackedcompanion Danny Mann. A few days afterwards Danny Mann visited therope-walk and had a long conversation with Eily and from that time thegirl's character seemed to have undergone a change. Her recreations andher attire became gayer but her cheerfulness of mind was gone. Herlover Myles Murphy a good-natured farmer from Killarney gained overher father to his interests and the old man pressed her either to giveconsent to the match or a good reason for her refusal. After adistressing altercation Eily left the house without a word of farewell.She had married Hardress Cregan secretly and the priest had diedimmediately after the ceremony. The first time she was seen but notrecognised in her boyish husband's company was by the Dalys to which
comment776,family his fellow-collegian and intimate friend Kyrle Daly belonged. Aboat passed along the river before their house containing a hooded girlthe hunchback and Hardress Cregan himself. After they had disappearedKyrle Daly rode to pay court to Anne Chute Hardress's cousin and tohis great distress learned that she could never be his wife althoughshe had no other engagement. From her manner he realised that he had arival and the knowledge plunged him into the deepest despair. After herrefusal he went to spend the night at one of his father's dairy farms afew miles down the river. Whilst supper was being prepared word camethat Hardress's boat was being swamped with every soul aboard.The collegian however brought the boat safely to the shore andprocured a room for his wife in the dairy-woman's cottage passing heroff as a relative of Danny Mann's. She retired at once and Hardress andKyrle sat talking together of Anne Chute. The sight of his friend'ssufferings won Hardress's sympathies. He protested his disbelief in theidea of another attachment and recommended perseverance."Trust everything to me" he said. "For your sake I will take some painsto become better known to this extraordinary girl and you may depend onit you shall not suffer in my good report."When the household was asleep Hardress went to his wife's room andfound her troubled because of the strangeness of their circumstances."I was thinking" she said "what a heart-break it would be to my fatherif anyone put it into his head that the case was worse than it is. Nomore would be wanting but just a little word on a scrap of paper tolet him know that he needn't be uneasy and he'd know all in time."The suggestion appeared to jar against the young husband's inclinations.He replied that if she wished he would return with her to her home anddeclare the marriage."If you are determined on certainly destroying our happiness" hecontinued "your will shall be dearer to me than fortune or friends. Ifyou have a father to feel for you you will not forget my love that Ihave a mother whom I love as tenderly and whose feelings deserve someconsideration."He took her hand and pressed it in a soothing manner."Come dry those sweet eyes while I tell you shortly what my plansshall be" he said."You have heard me speak of Danny Mann's sister who lives on the sideof the Purple Mountain in the Gap of Dunlough I have had two neatrooms fitted up for you in her cottage and you can have books to readand a little garden to amuse you and a Kerry pony to ride over themountains. In the meantimes I will steal a visit now and then to mymother who spends the autumn in the neighbourhood. I will gradually lether into my secret and obtain her forgiveness. I am certain she willnot withhold it. I shall then present you to her. She will commend your
comment777,modesty and gentleness we will send for your father and then where isthe tongue that shall venture to wag against the fame of Eily Cregan"The young man left her a little chagrined at her apparent slowness inappreciating his noble condescension. In his boyhood he had entertaineda passion for his cousin Anne Chute but after the long separation ofschool and college he had imagined that his early love was completelyforgotten. The feeling with which he regarded her now was rather ofresentment than indifference and it had been with a secret creeping ofthe heart that he had witnessed what he thought was the successfulprogress of Kyrle Daly's attachment. It was under those circumstancesthat he formed his present hasty union with Eily. His love for her wasdeep sincere and tender. Her entire and unbounded confidence herextreme beauty her simplicity and timid deference made a soothingcompensation to his heart for the coldness of the haughty thoughsuperior beauty whose inconstancy had raised his indignation.In the morning accompanied by Eily and Danny Mann he sailed forBallybunion where they rested in a cavern while the hunchback sought aneligible lodging for the night. During his absence Hardress told Eilythat Danny Mann was his foster-brother and that he himself had been thecause of the poor fellow's deformity."When we were children he was my constant companion" he said."Familiarity produced a feeling of equality on which he presumed so faras to offer rudeness to a little relative of mine a Miss Chute who wason a visit to my mother. She complained to me and my vengeance wassummary. I seized him by the collar and hurled him with desperate forceto the bottom of a flight of stairs. An injury was done to his spine."But Danny Mann had shown naught but good nature and kindly feeling eversince. His attachment had become the attachment of a zealot. Hardresswas sometimes alarmed at the profane importance he attached to hismaster's wishes he seemed to care but little what laws he mighttransgress when the gratification of Hardress's inclination was in
comment778,question._II.--Tempted_A week afterwards Hardress visited his parents at their Killarneyresidence to find that his mother with her niece Anne Chute had goneto a grand ball in the neighbourhood. His father was spending the nightwith his boon fellows and a favourite old huntsman lay dying in a roomnear by. This retainer told his young master that Anne Chute loved himwell and that she deserved a better fortune than to love withoutreturn. Hardress went to bed and was awakened by his mother upon herreturn. She reproved him for his long absence and told him of thesensation his beautiful cousin was making in society. In the morning hemet Anne with some consciousness and distress. A womanly reserve anddelicacy made the girl unwilling to affect an intimacy that might not begraciously acknowledged. She treated him coldly and began to read somesilly novel of the day."Ah Eily my own own Eily" he murmured to himself. "You are worththis fine lady a hundred times over"His mother appeared her raillery entrapped both him and Anne in a sceneof coquetry. No longer embarrassed by the feeling of strangeness andapprehension which had depressed her spirits on their first meetingafter his return from college Anne now assumed ease and liveliness ofmanner. Every hour he spent in her society removed from his mind theprejudice he had conceived against her and supplied its place with afeeling of strong kindness. When he left the merry circle to return toEily blank regret fell suddenly upon his heart. But the sorrow whichAnne manifested at his departure and the cordial pleasure with whichshe heard of his intention to return soon inspired him with thestrangest happiness. The next time he thought of Eily and his cousinthe conjunction was less favourable to the former."My poor little love" he thought. "How much she has to learn before shecan assume with comfort to herself the place for which I have designedher"At the cottage Eily received him with rapture and affection and everyother feeling was banished from his mind. But in the course of theevening she remarked that he was more silent and abstracted than she hadever seen him and that he more frequently spoke in connection of somelittle breach of etiquette or inelegance of manner than in those termsof eloquent praise and fondness which he was accustomed to lavish uponher. The next day he returned to his mother's house leaving her intears.That night Mrs. Cregan gave a ball at which he was one of the gayestrevellers. Soon afterwards his mother also told him that Anne was inlove and with none other than himself. In great agitation he repliedthat he had already pledged himself to another. She insisted that anyother engagement must be broken since if there was to be a victim itshould not be Anne. The lady's violent maternal affection overruled him
comment779,and in spite of the call of honour he dared not tell her that he wasalready married.During the ensuing weeks Eily perceived a rapid and fearful change inhis temper and appearance. His visits were fewer and shorter and hismanner became extraordinarily restrained and conscious.But when she told him that the loneliness was troubling her he accusedher of jealousy."If I was jealous and with reason" said Eily. smiling seriously"nobody would ever know it for I wouldn't say a word only stretch uponmy bed and die. I wouldn't be long in his way I'll engage."Hardress warned her never to inquire into his secrets nor to effect aninfluence which he would not admit. He bade her avoid suffering theslightest suspicion to appear since when suspicions are afloat men findthe temptation to furnish them with a cause almost irresistible. Eilyprotested that she was joking and his uneasy conscience threw him intoa paroxysm of fury."Curse on you" he cried. "Curse on your beauty curse on my own follyfor I have been undone by both I hate you Take the truth I'll not bepoisoned with it I am sick of you you have disgusted me I will easemy heart by telling you the whole. If I seek the society of other womenit is because I find not among them your meanness and vulgarity""Oh Hardress" shrieked the affrighted girl "you are not in earnestnow""I do _not_ joke" he exclaimed with a hoarse vehemence."Oh my dear Hardress listen to me Hear your poor Eily for one momentOh my poor father Forgive me Hardress. I left my home and all foryou. Oh do not cast me off I will do anything to please you. I willnever open my lips again. Only say you do not mean all that."He tore himself away leaving Eily unconscious on the ground. On thesummit of the Purple Mountain which was all surrounded by mist he metDanny Mann and confided to him that his love of Eily had turned tohatred asking his advice concerning what must be done."Sorrow trouble would I even give myself about her" said Danny "onlysend her home packin' to her father""Should I send Eily home to earn for myself the reputation of afaithless villain" said Hardress."Why then I'll tell you what I'd do" said Danny nodding his head."Pay her passage out to Quaybec an' put her aboard of a three-master.Do by her as you'd do to dat glove you have on your hand. Make it comeoff as well as it comes on an' if it fits too tight take the knife toit. Only give me the word an' I'll engage Eily O'Connor will nevertrouble you any more. Don't ax me any questions only if you areagreeable take off that glove an' give it to me for a token. Lave therest to Danny."Hardress gazed upon the face of the hunchback with an expression ofgaping terror as if he stood in the presence of the Arch Tempterhimself. Then he caught him by the throat and shook him with appallingviolence."If you ever dare again to utter a word or meditate a thought of evil
comment780,against that unhappy creature" he cried "I will tear you limb fromlimb between my hands"_III.--"Found Drowned"_Hardress had left Eily almost unprovided with funds. After a few weeksshe was obliged to write for pecuniary assistance. The letter wasunheeded. She borrowed a pony and went to ask advice from her father'sbrother Father O'Connor of Castle Island. The priest received her verycoldly but became deeply moved upon hearing that she was legallymarried. She begged him to inform her father that she hoped soon to askhis pardon for all the sorrow she had caused. He gave her all the moneyhe had and she returned to the cottage.Danny Mann delivered Eily's letter and sat drinking with his master inMrs. Cregan's drawing-room. Anne Chute entered and finding the man sheloved in an intoxicated condition she withdrew in sorrow and disgust.He asked the girl's forgiveness when soberness returned and she toldhim that she was greatly distressed because of his changed manner. For along time past there had been a distressing series of misconceptions onher part and of inconsistencies on his. She could not explain howdeeply troubled she felt.The intoxication of passion overcame Hardress and he told her that thekey to everything was that he loved her. She forgave him and he wasabout to send a reassuring line to his mother when he found in hishands a portion of Eily's letter in which she begged him to let her goback to her father. He turned white with fear but Mrs. Cregan enteredand her strong will overbore his scruples. He declared himself ready tomarry his beautiful cousin. Then he sought Danny Mann and reminded himof his suggestion about hiring a passage for Eily in a North Americanvessel."You bade me draw my glove from off my hand and give it for a warrant"he said plucking off the glove slowly finger by finger. "My mind isaltered. I married too young I didn't know my own mind. I am burningwith this thralldom. Here is my glove."Danny took it whilst they exchanged a look of cold and fatalintelligence. Hardress gave him a purse and repeated that Eily must notstay in Ireland that three thousand miles of roaring ocean were asecurity for silence. Not a hair of her head must be hurt but he wouldnever see her more. Then he wrote on the back of Eily's letterinstructions for her to put herself under the bearer's care and hewould restore her to her father. She determined to obey at once andwithout a murmur and at nightfall left the cottage in Danny's company.Two hours afterwards Hardress himself arrived in a fit of compunction.On learning that they had departed he swore to himself that if this hisservant exceeded his views he would tear his flesh from his bones andgibbet him as a miscreant and a ruffian.The night grew wild and stormy a thunderstorm broke over the hill.Hardress slumbered in his chair crying out "My glove my glove Youused it against my meaning I meant but banishment. We shall be hangedfor this"He awoke from a fearsome nightmare and unable to remain longer in thecottage ran home with the speed of one distracted. There he rebuked hismother wildly telling her that she had forced him into madness andthat he was free to execute her will--to marry or hang whichever she
comment781,pleased. His love of Anne now became entirely dormant and he was ableto estimate the greatness of his guilt without even the suggestion of apalliative. Anne returned to Castle Chute and preparations were soonbeing made for the wedding. Hardress and his mother went to stay thereand Kyrle Daly heard for the first time that he had won the girl's loveinstead of pleading his fellow-collegian's cause as he had promised. Theanger he felt was diverted by a family tragedy--the death of his mother.At her wake Hardress appeared and found himself face to face with oldMihil O'Connor his father-in-law. The ropemaker who had only a faintrecollection of having met him before told him of his heart-breakbecause of Eily's disappearance and misread his agitation for sympathy.Some while afterwards the gentry of the neighbourhood hunted the foxand the dogs found on the bank of the Shannon a body covered with alarge blue mantle that was drenched with wet and mire. A pair of smallfeet in Spanish leather shoes appearing from below the end of thegarment showed that the body was that of a female whilst a mass oflong fair hair which escaped from the hood proved that death had foundthe victim untimely in her youth._IV.--Exiled for Life_Hardress confided the mournful story to his mother assuring her that hewas Eily's murderer. After the first extreme agitation the ladydeclared that he overrated the measure of his guilt. She reproached himfor his lack of confidence after all the love she had showered uponhim. He clenched his hand and she affected to fear that he intended tostrike her. At her outcry of fear he sank to her feet lowering hisforehead to the very dust."There is one way left for reparation" he said. "I will give myself up.There is peace and comfort in the thought."He was interrupted by the entrance of Anne. Mrs. Cregan accounted forher son's excitement by saying that he was ill. Later in the eveningthey heard that the coroner had not even found anyone to identify thebody and that the jury had returned a verdict of "Found Drowned." Somedays afterwards Hardress went shooting to the creek and believing thathe had killed a serving-man fled panic-stricken back to the house. Thefellow however was unhurt but his cries attracted the attention of astranger who had lain concealed under a bank. A party of soldiersappeared now and fired at this unknown man and soon he staggered andwas taken prisoner.Mrs. Cregan came to Hardress's room with fearful tidings. Eily's dresshad been recognised and suspicion had fallen upon Danny Mann. Hardresstold her that his former servant had left the country but soon thesoldiers arrived at the house with the hunchback in charge. Late thatnight Hardress left his bed and entered the stable where Danny wasconfined. The hunchback advanced towards him slowly his hands wreathedtogether his jaw dropped and his eyes filled with tears. He offeredHardress the glove."I had my token surely for what I done" he said. "'Here is yourwarrant' you says. Worn't them your words""But not for death" replied Hardress. "I did not say for death.""I own you didn't" said Danny Mann. "I felt for you an' I wouldn'twait for you to say it. Your eye looked murder as sure as that moon isshinin' so sure the sign of death was on your face that time whateverway your words went."Hardress gave him money and helped him to escape bidding him leave thecountry. "If ever we should meet again on Irish soil" he said "it mustbe the death of either."The exertions for Danny Mann's recapture proved unavailing and in a fewweeks the affair had begun to grow unfamiliar to the tongues andrecollections of the people. Hardress's depression reached an unbearabledegree and Anne at last grew seriously uneasy. He assured her that ifshe knew all she would pity and not blame. Then one day when they werewalking together they came upon some countryfolk dancing in the road
comment782,and amongst them Hardress recognised the hunchback. He caught him by thethroat and flung him violently against the wall.Danny Mann was taken into custody again and before the magistratetold of Hardress's complicity in the crime. He declared that he hadalways loved his master but that from the moment of the assault achange had come over his love."He had his revenge an' I'll have mine" he said. "He doesn't feel forme an' I won't feel for him. Write down Danny Mann for the murderer ofEily an' write down Hardress Cregan for his adviser." He produced thecertificate of Eily's marriage. "I took it out of her bosom after--" Heshuddered with such violence that the door trembled. "She kep' her handin her bosom upon that paper to the last gasp as if she thought it wasto rob her of that I wanted."The magistrate accompanied by a guard rode to Castle Chute. It was thewedding evening and the house was filled with gay company. As all satat table together Hardress heard a low voice whisper in his ear"Arise and fly for your life" The wineglass fell from his hand and hebecame filled with terror. Once again he heard the voice "Arise I tellyou The army is abroad and your life is in danger"As he was preparing to escape his mother entered his presence."The doors are all defended" she cried. "There is a soldier set onevery entrance You are trapped and caught The window--come this wayquick--quick"She drew him passively into her own bed-chamber some minutes later thesoldiers forced their way forward and found him concealed in an innerplace. His mother sank at his feet and cried out that the crime washers since she had been the author of his first temptation thestumbling-block between him and repentance."I have tied the cord upon your throat" she shrieked. "I have been yourfellest foe You drank in pride with my milk and passion under myindulgence"Hardress took the wretched woman in his arms and kissed her forehead."I will pray for you at the moment of my death as you will pray forme" he said. Then he surrendered himself to the soldiers and was takenaway. At the trial the mercy of the executive power was extended to hislife and he was sentenced to perpetual exile. As the convict ship whichwas to bear him from home waited in the river he was brought from hisgaol and left for a short time on the quay where he heard that Eily'sfather had died after praying for and forgiving his enemies. The boatarrived to convey him to the ship and whilst descending the steps hewas overcome by a seizure and would have fallen but for the aid of hisescort. The dawn of the following morning beheld him tossed upon thewaves of the Atlantic and looking back to the clifted heads of theShannon that stood like a gigantic portal opening far behind. The landof his nativity faded rapidly on his sight but before the vessel camein sight of that of his exile he had rendered up the life which the lawforbore to take.Danny Mann died amid all the agonies of a remorse which made even thosewhose eyes had looked upon such cases shrink back with fear and wonder.Mrs. Cregan lived many years after Hardress's departure practising theaustere and humiliating works of piety which her Church prescribes forthe penitent.Anne Chute in the course of time became Kyrle Daly's wife and theywere as happy as earth could render hearts that looked to higherdestinies and a more lasting rest.                                   JOHN HABBERTONHelen's Babies     John Habberton the author of "Helen's Babies" was born in     Brooklyn New York on February 24 1842. He enlisted in the     army in 1862 and served through the Civil War at the close     of which he adopted journalism as a profession becoming in     due course literary editor of the "Christian Union." His     first and most popular story "Helen's Babies" after being
comment783,     declined by various publishers appeared in 1876 and more     than a quarter of a million copies have been sold in America     alone. According to Mr. Habberton himself the story "grew out     of an attempt to keep for a single day the record of the     doings of a brace of boys of whom the author is half-owner."     Apart from a number of novels Mr. Habberton has also written     a "Life of George Washington" and a play "Deacon Cranket"     performed more than five hundred times._I.--The Imps_The first cause of the existence of this book may be found in a letterwritten by my sister and received by me Harry Burton salesman ofwhite goods bachelor aged twenty-eight just as I was trying to decidewhere I should spend a fortnight's vacation. She suggested as I wasalways complaining of never having time to read I should stay at herplace while she and her husband went on a fortnight's visit. She ownedshe would feel easier if she knew there was a man in the house."Just the thing" I ejaculated. Five minutes later I had telegraphed myacceptance and had mentally selected books enough for a dozenvacations. I knew enough of Helen's boys to be sure they would give oneno annoyance. Budge the elder was five years of age and hadgenerally during my flying visits worn a shy serious meditativenoble face and Toddie was a happy little know-nothing of three summerswith tangled yellow hair.Three days later I hired a hackman to drive me from Hillcrest Station.Half a mile from my brother-in-law's residence the horses shiedviolently and the driver after talking freely to them remarked "Thatwas one of the Imps"As he spoke the offending youth came panting beside our carriage and ina very dirty sailor-suit I recognised my nephew Budge. Then a smallerboy emerged from the bushes at the side of the road and I beheld theunmistakable lineaments of Toddie."They're my nephews" I gasped."Budge" I said with all the sternness I could command "do you knowme""Yes you're Uncle Harry. Did you bring us anything""I wish I could have brought you some big whippings for behaving sobadly. Get into this carriage."As they clambered up I noticed that each one carried a very dirtytowel knotted tightly in the centre. After some moments' disgustedcontemplation of these rags I asked Budge what these towels were for."They're not towels they're dollies" promptly answered my nephew."Goodness" I exclaimed. "I should think your mother might buy yourespectable dolls and not let you appear in public with these loathsomerags.""We don't like buyed dollies" said Budge. "These dollies is lovely.Mine's got blue eyes and Toddie's has got brown eyes.""I want to shee your watch" remarked Toddie snatching the chain androlling into my lap."Oh-oo-ee So do I" shouted Budge hastening to occupy one knee and intransit wiping his shoes on my trousers and the skirts of my coat.A carriage containing a couple of ladies was rapidly approaching Idropped my head to avoid meeting their glance for my few minutes ofcontact with my dreadful nephews had made me feel inexpressibly un-neat.The carriage stopped. I heard my own name spoken. There erect freshneat bright-eyed fair-faced smiling and observant sat Miss AliceMayton a lady who for about a year I had been adoring from afar."When did you arrive Mr. Burton" she asked. "You're certainly ahappy-looking trio--so unconventional You look as if you had beenhaving _such_ a good time.""I--I assure you Miss Mayton that my experience has been the reverseof a pleasant one. If King Herod were yet alive I'd volunteer as anexecutioner."
comment784,"You dreadful wretch" exclaimed the lady. "Mother let me make youacquainted with Mr. Burton Helen Lawrence's brother. How is yoursister Mr. Burton""I don't know" I replied "she's gone with her husband on a visit andI've been silly enough to promise to give an eye to the place whilethey're away.""Why how delightful" said Miss Mayton. "Such horses Such flowersSuch a cook""And such children" said I glaring at the Imps and rescuing myhandkerchief from Toddie."Why they're the best children in the world Helen told me so. Childrenwill be children you know. I don't wish to give any hints but at Mrs.Clarkson's where we're boarding there's not a flower in the wholegarden. I break the Tenth Commandment every time I pass ColonelLawrence's. Good-bye.""Of course you'll call" said Miss Mayton as the carriage started"it's dreadfully stupid here. No men except on Sundays."I bowed assent. In the contemplation of all the shy possibilities myshort chat with Miss Mayton had suggested I had quite forgotten mydusty clothing and the two little living causes thereof._II.--The Fate of a Bouquet_Next morning at breakfast Toddie remarked "Ocken Hawwy darsh an awfoofunny chunt upstairs. I show it to you after brepspup.""Toddie's a silly little boy" said Budge "he always says brepspup forbrekbux.""Oh what does he mean by chunt Budge""I guess he means trunk" replied my elder nephew.Recollections of my childish delight in rummaging an old trunk caused meto smile sympathetically at Toddie to his great delight.A direful thought struck me. I dashed upstairs. Yes he did mean mytrunk. While a campaigner I had learned to reduce packing to an exactscience. Now if I had an atom of pride in me I might have glorifiedmyself for it certainly seemed as if the heap upon the floor couldnever have come out of one single trunk.In the lid of my dressing-case lay my dress-coat tightly rolled up.Snatching it up with a violent exclamation there dropped from it--oneof these infernal dolls. A howl resounded from the doorway."You tookted my dolly out of her k'adle--want to wock my dolly oo-ee-ee"I called the girl and asked where the key was that locked the doorbetween my room and the children's."Please sir Toddie threw it down the well."I removed the lock and told the coachman to get ready at once to driveto Paterson where the nearest locksmith lived by the hill road one ofthe most beautiful roads in America.Away went the horses and up rose a piercing shriek and a terrible roar.I looked out hastily only to see Budge and Toddie running after thecarriage and crying pitifully. The driver stopped of his own accord--heseemed to know the children's ways and their results--and I helped themin meekly hoping the eye of Providence was upon me.That afternoon I devoted myself to making a bouquet for Miss Mayton anda most delightful occupation I found it.Not that I was in love with Miss Mayton. A man may honestly and stronglyadmire a handsome brilliant woman and delight himself in trying togive her pleasure without feeling it necessary she shall give himherself in return.My delight suddenly became clouded. What would folks say Everybody knewwhere Mike was employed--everybody knew I was the only gentleman atpresent residing at Colonel Lawrence's. Ah I had it.I had seen in one of the library drawers a pasteboard box--just thesize. I dropped my card into the bottom neatly fitted in the bouquetand went in search of Mike.He winked cheeringly and said he would do it "as clane as a whistle.Divil a man can see but the angels and they won't tell.""Very well Mike. Here's a dollar for you. You'll find the box on thehat-rack in the hall."With a head full of pleasing fancies I went down to supper and found mynew friends unusually good. Their ride seemed to have toned down theirboisterousness and elevated their little souls. So when they invited meto put them to bed I gladly accepted. Toddie disappeared somewhere and
comment785,came back disconsolate."Can't find my doll's k'adle" he whined."Never mind old pet" said I soothingly "uncle will ride you on hisfoot.""But I want my dolly's k'adle tawse my dolly's in it and I want toshee her""Don't you want me to tell you a story"For a moment Toddle's face indicated a terrible internal conflictbetween old Adam and Mother Eve finally curiosity overpowered naturaldepravity and Toddie muttered "Yesh"Very soon a knock at the door interrupted me. "Come in" I shouted.In stepped Mike with an air of the greatest secrecy handed me a letterand _the_ box. What could it mean I hastily opened the envelope whileToddie shrieked "Oh darsh my dolly's k'adle--dare tizh" snatched andopened the box and displayed--his dollMy heart sickened as I read "Miss Mayton herewith returns to Mr. Burtonthe package which has just arrived with his card. She recognises thecontents as a portion of the property of one of Mr. Burton's nephewsbut is unable to understand why it should have been sent to her.""Toddie" I roared as my younger nephew caressed his loathsome doll"where did you get that box""On the hat-wack" he replied with perfect fearlessness. "I keeps it inze bookcase djawer and somebody took it 'way an' put nasty ole flowersin it.""Where are those flowers" I demanded.Toddie looked up with considerable surprise but promptly replied "Ifroed 'em away--don't want no ole flowers in my dolly's k'adle. That'sze way she wocks--see" And this horrible little destroyer of humanhopes rolled that box back and forth with the most utter unconcern.Of language to express my feeling to Toddie I could find absolutelynone. Within these few minutes I had discovered how very anxious Ireally was to merit Miss Mayton's regard and how very different was theregard I wanted from that which I had previously hoped might be accordedto me. Under my stern glance Toddie gradually lost interest in his dolland began to thrust forth his piteous lower lip and to weep copiously."Dee Lord not make me sho bad." He even retired to a corner and hid hisface in self-imposed penance."Never mind Toddie" said I sadly "you didn't mean to do it I know.""I wantsh to love you" sobbed Toddie."Well come here you poor little fellow."Toddie came to my arms shed tears freely upon my shirt-front andfinally remarked "Wantsh you to love me"I kissed Toddie and petted him and at length succeeded in quietinghim. He looked earnestly confidingly in my eyes and then said "Kishmy dolly too"I obeyed. My forgiveness was complete and so was my humiliation. Iwithdrew abruptly to write an apology._III.--Budge the Interpreter_On Monday morning I devoted myself to Toddie's expiatory bouquet inwhich I had the benefit of my nephews' assistance and counsel and tookenforced part in the conversation.At two o'clock I instructed Maggie to dress my nephews and at three westarted to make our call. As we approached I saw Miss Mayton on thepiazza. Handing the bouquet to Toddie we entered the garden when heshrieked "Oh there's a cutter-grass" and with the carelessness bornof perfect ecstasy dropped the bouquet.I snatched it before it reached the ground dragged him up to MissMayton and told him to give the bouquet to the lady. As she stooped tokiss him he wriggled off like a little eel shouted "Tum on" to his
comment786,brother and a moment later both were following the lawn-mower at arespectful distance."Bless the little darlings" said Miss Mayton. "I do love to seechildren enjoying themselves"We settled down to a pleasant chat about books pictures music and thegossip of our set. Handsome intelligent composed tastefully dressedshe awakened to the uttermost every admiring sentiment and every manlyfeeling. When I began to take leave Miss Mayton's mother insisted thatwe should stay to dinner."For myself I should be delighted Mrs. Mayton" said I "but mynephews have hardly learned company manners yet.""Oh I'll take care of the little dears" said Miss Mayton. "They'll begood with me I know."She insisted and the pleasure of submitting to her will was so greatthat I would have risked even greater mischief. The soup was served andToddie immediately tilted his plate so that part of its contents soughtrefuge in the folds of Miss Mayton's dainty snowy dress. She treatedthat wretched boy with the most Christian forbearance during the rest ofthe meal.When the dessert was finished she quickly excused herself and Iremoved Toddie to a secluded corner and favoured him with a lecturewhich caused him to howl pitifully and compelled me to caress him andundo all the good I had done.I awaited Miss Mayton's reappearance to offer an apology for Toddie andto make my adieus. The other ladies departed in twos and threes andleft us without witnesses.Suddenly she appeared and whatever was the cause she looked queenly.She dropped into a chair and the boys retired to the end of the piazzato make experiments on a large Newfoundland dog while I the happiestman alive talked to the glorious woman before me and enjoyed herradiant beauty. The twilight came and deepened and our voicesunconsciously dropped to lower tones and her voice seemed purest music.Suddenly a small shadow came between and the voice of Budge remarked"Uncle Harry 'spects you Miss Mayton.""Suspects me Of what pray" exclaimed the lady patting my nephew'scheek."Budge" said I--I felt my voice rising nearly to a scream--"Budge Imust beg you to respect the sanctity of confidential communications.""What is it Budge" persisted Miss Mayton. "You know the old adage Mr.Burton 'Children and fools speak the truth.' Of what does he suspectme Budge""'Tain't _sus_pect at all" said Budge "it's espect.""Expect" echoed Miss Mayton."Respect is what the boy is trying to say Miss Mayton" I interrupted."Budge has a terrifying faculty for asking questions and the result ofsome of them this morning was my endeavour to explain the nature of therespect in which gentlemen hold ladies.""Yes" said Budge "I know all about it. Only Uncle Harry don't say itright. What he calls respect _I_ calls _love_.""Miss Mayton" I said hastily earnestly "Budge is a marplot but he isa very truthful interpreter for all that. Whatever my fate may be donot----""I want to talk some" observed Budge. "You talk all the whole time.I--when I loves anybody I kisses them." Miss Mayton gave a little start
comment787,and my thoughts followed each other with unimagined rapidity. She wasnot angry evidently. Could it be that---- I bent over her and actedon Budge's suggestion. She raised her head slightly and I saw thatAlice Mayton had surrendered at discretion. Taking her hand I offeredto the Lord more fervent thanks than He had ever heard from me inchurch. Then Budge said "I wants to kiss you too." And I saw myglorious Alice snatch the little scamp into her arms and treat him withmore affection than I had ever imagined was in her nature.Suddenly two or three ladies came upon the piazza."Come boys" said I. "Then I'll call with the carriage to-morrow atthree Miss Mayton. Good-evening."That night I wrote to my sister to inform her that the scales had fallenfrom my eyes--I saw clearly that my nephews were angels. And I begged torefer her to Alice Mayton for collateral evidence._IV.--The Fruit of My Visit_A few days later I had a letter from my sister to say she had beenrecalling a fortnight's experience they once had of courtship in aboarding-house so had determined to cut short her visit and hurry home.Friday morning they intended to arrive--blessings on their thoughtfulhearts And this was Friday. I hurried into the boys' room and shouted"Toddie Budge Who do you think is coming to see you this morning""Who" asked Budge."Organ-grinder" queried Toddie."No your papa and mamma."Budge looked like an angel at once but Toddie murmured mournfully "Ifought it wash an organ-grinder.""Oh Uncle Harry" said Budge in a perfect delirium of delight "Ibelieve if my papa and mamma had stayed away any longer I believe Iwould _die_. I've been so lonesome for them that I haven't known what todo. I've cried whole pillowsful about it right here in the dark.""Why my poor old fellow" said I picking him up and kissing him. "Whydidn't you come and tell Uncle Harry and let him try to comfort you""I couldn't" said Budge. "When I gets lonesome it feels as if my mouthwas all tied up and a big great stone was right in here." And Budgeput his hand on his chest."If a big tone wash inshide of me" said Toddie "I'd take it out andfrow it at the shickens.""Toddie" I said "aren't you glad papa and mamma are coming""Yesh" said Toddie. "Mamma always bwings me candy fen she goesanyfere."During the hour which passed before it was time to start for the depotmy sole attention was devoted to keeping the children from soiling theirclothes but my success was so little I lost my temper utterly."Harness the horse Mike" I shouted."An' the goat too" added Budge.Five minutes later I was seated in the carriage."Are you all ready boys" I asked."In a minute" said Budge "soon as I fix this. Now" he continuedgetting into his seat and seizing the reins and whip "go ahead""Wait a minute Budge. Put down that whip and don't touch the goat withit once. I'm going to drive very slowly all you need do is to hold thereins.""All right" said Budge "but I like to look like mans when I drive."The horses went at a gentle trot and the goat followed very closely.When within a minute of the depot the train swept in. I gave the horsesthe whip looked and saw the boys close behind me. Nothing but thesharpest of turns saved me from a severe accident. As it was I heard
comment788,two hard thumps upon the wooden wall and two frightful howls and sawboth my nephews mixed up on the platform while the driver of the stagegrowled in my ear "What in thunder did you let 'em hitch that goat toyour axletree for"How the goat's head and shoulders maintained their normal connectionduring the last minute of my drive I leave naturalists to explain.Fortunately the children had struck on their heads and the Lawrence-Burton skull is a marvel of solidity. I set them on their feet promisedthem all the candy they could eat for a week and hurried them to theother side of the depot. Budge rushed at Tom exclaiming "See my goatpapa"Helen was somewhat concerned about the children but found time to lookat me with so much of sympathy humour affection and condescensionthat I really felt relieved when we reached the house. And howgloriously the rest of the day passed off We had a delightful littlelunch and Tom brought up a bottle of Roederer and we drank to "her andher mother." Then Helen proposed "The makers of the match--Budge andToddie" which was honoured with bumpers. The gentlemen toasted did notrespond but stared so curiously I sprang from my chair and kissed themsoundly while Helen and Tom exchanged significant glances.Young as they are I find frequent reason to be jealous of them butartifice alone can prevent them monopolising the time of an adorablebeing of whose society I cannot possibly have too much. She insiststhat when the ceremony takes place in December they shall officiate asgroomsmen and I have no doubt she will carry her point In fact when Iretire for the night without first seeking their room and putting agrateful kiss on their unconscious lips my conscience upbraids me withbase ingratitude. To think I might yet be a hopeless bachelor had it notbeen for them is to overflow with gratitude to the Giver of Helen'sBabies.                                   LUDOVIC HALEVYThe Abb Constantin     Ludovic Halevy born in Paris on January 1 1834 was a nephew     of Jacques Franois Halevy the famous operatic composer.     Beginning life in the Civil Service he himself achieved     considerable distinction as a dramatic author "Frou-Frou"     written in collaboration with Meilhac being one of the     greatest theatrical successes of his century. He soon     however forsook the drama for fiction. His first novel     "Monsieur and Madame Cardinal" published in 1873 gave ample     promise of the inventive genius and gift of characterisation     that were fully realised nine years later in "L'Abb     Constantin." The tale an exquisite study of French provincial     life came as a distinct revelation of French life and     character to English readers. It has reached 240 editions and     has been translated into all European languages. In 1886     Halevy was elected to the French Academy. He died on May 8     1908._I.--"The Good Days Are Gone"_With footstep firm and strong despite his weight of years an oldpriest was walking along a dusty country road one sunny day in May 1881.It was more than thirty years since the Abb Constantin had first become_cur_ of the little village sleeping there in the sunny plain ofFrance beside a dainty stream called the Lizotte. He had been walkingfor a quarter of an hour along the wall of the Chteau de Longueval. Ashe reached the massive entrance gates he stopped and gazed sadly at twoimmense bills pasted on the pillars. They announced the sale by auctionthat day of the Longueval estate divided into four lots 1 Thecastle with all its grounds and parks 2 the farm ofBlanche-Couronne 700 acres 3 the farm of Rozeraie 500 acres 4the forest and woods of Mionne 900 acres. The reserve prices totalledthe respectable sum of 2050000 francsSo that magnificent estate which for two centuries had passed intactfrom father to son in the Longueval family was to be divided. The bills
comment789,announced it was true that after the preliminary sale of the four lotsthe highest bidder might bid for the whole estate. But it was anenormous sum and no purchaser was likely to present himself.The Marquise de Longueval dying six months since had left three heirsher grandchildren two of whom were under age so that the estate had tobe put up for sale. Pierre the eldest an extravagant young man oftwenty-three had foolishly squandered half his money and was quiteunable to re-purchase Longueval.It was twelve o'clock. In an hour the chteau would have a new master.Who would he be Who could take the place of the marquise the oldfriend of the country cur and the kindly friend of all the villagers.The old priest walked on thinking sadly of the habits of thirty yearssuddenly interrupted. Every Thursday and every Sunday he had dined atthe chteau. How much had they made of him Cur of Longueval All hislife he had been that had dreamed of nothing else. He loved his littlechurch the little village and his little vicarage.Still in pensive mood he was passing the park of Lavardens when heheard some one calling him. Looking up he saw the Countess of Lavardensand her son Paul. She was a widow her son a handsome young man who hadmade a bad start in the world and now contented himself by spending somemonths in Paris every year when he dissipated the annual allowance fromhis mother and returned home for the rest of the year to loaf about inidleness or in pursuit of stupid sports."Where are you off to Monsieur le Cur" asked the countess."To Souvigny to learn the result of the sale.""Stay here with us. M. de Larnac is there and will hasten back with thenews. But I can tell you who are the new owners of the castle."At this the abb turned into the gates of the countess's grounds andjoined that lady and her son on the terrace of their house. The newowners it appeared were to be M. de Larnac M. Gallard a rich Parisbanker and the countess herself for the three had agreed to purchaseit between them."It is all settled" the lady assured him. But presently M. de Larnacarrived with the news that they had been unable to buy it as someAmerican had paid an enormous sum for the entire estate. The person whowas now to be the great lady of Longueval was named Madame Scott.M. de Larnac had some further particulars to add. He had heard that the
comment790,Scotts were great upstarts and that the new owner of the castle hadactually been a beggar in New York. A great lawsuit had resulted infavour of her and her husband making them the owners of a silver-mine."And we are to have such people for neighbours" exclaimed the countess."An adventuress and no doubt a Protestant Monsieur le Cur"The abb was very sore at heart and never doubting but that the newmistress of the castle would be no friend of his he took his wayhomeward. In his imagination he saw this Madame Scott settled at thecastle and despising his little Catholic church and all his simpleservices to the quiet village folk.He was still brooding over the unhappy fate of Longueval when hisgodson Jean Reynaud--son of his old friend Dr. Reynaud--to whom he hadbeen as good as a father and who was worthy of the old priest's lovedismounted at his door. For Jean was now a lieutenant in the artillerystationed in the district and much of his leisure was spent at theabb's house. Jean tried to console him by saying that even though thisAmerican Madame Scott were not a Catholic she was known to begenerous and would no doubt give him money for the poor._II.--The New Parishioners_The abb and his godson were in the garden next day when they heard acarriage stop at the gate. Two ladies alighted dressed in simpletravelling costumes. They came into the garden and the elder of thetwo who seemed to be no more than twenty-five came up to the AbbConstantin saying with only the slightest foreign accent "I am obligedto introduce myself M. le Cur. I am Madame Scott in whose nameyesterday the castle and estate were bought and if it is noinconvenience I should be glad to take five minutes of your time." Thenturning to her companion she said "This is my sister Miss BettinaPercival as you may have guessed."Greatly agitated the abb bowed his respects and led into his littlevicarage the new mistress of Longueval and her sister. The cloth hadbeen laid for the simple meal of the old priest and the lieutenant andthe ladies seemed charmed with the humble comfort of the place."Look now Susie" said Miss Bettina "isn't this just the sort ofvicarage you hoped it would be""And the abb also if he will allow me to say so" said Madame Scott."For what did I say in the train this morning Bettina and only alittle while ago in the carriage""My sister said to me M. le Cur" said Miss Percival "that shedesired above all things that the abb should not be young normelancholy nor severe but that he should be white-haired and gentleand good.""And that is you exactly M. le Cur" said Madame Scott brightly. "I
comment791,find you just as I had hoped and I trust you may be as well pleasedwith your new parishioners.""Parishioners" exclaimed the abb. "But then you are Catholics""Certainly we are Catholics" And noting the surprise of the old abbshe went on to say "Ah I understand Our name and our country made youexpect we should be Protestants and unfriendly to you and your people.But our mother was a Canadian and a Catholic of French origin and thatis why my sister and I speak French with just a little foreign accent.My husband is a Protestant but he leaves me full liberty and so my twochildren are being educated in my own faith. And that is why we havecome to see you the first day we have arrived."The good old priest was overwhelmed by the news but his joy almostbrought tears to his eyes when the ladies each presented him with athousand francs and promised five hundred francs a month for the poor.He had never handled so much money in all his life before."Why there will be no poor left in all the district" he stammered."And we should be glad if that were so" said Madame Scott "for we haveplenty and we could not do better with it."Then followed the happiest little dinner party that had ever taken placebeneath the abb's roof. Madame Scott explained how her husband hadbought the chteau as a surprise for her and that neither she nor hersister had seen it until that morning."Now tell me" she suggested "what they said about the new owner." Theold priest blushed and was at a loss to answer. "Well you are asoldier" she continued turning to Lieutenant Reynaud "and you willtell me. Did they say that I had been a beggar""Yes I heard that said.""And that I had been a performer in a travelling circus""That also I heard said" he admitted."I thank you for your frankness and now let me tell you that while Ican see nothing in either case that would be any disgrace to me thestory does not happen to be true. I have known what it is to be poorfor my parents died eight years ago leaving us only a great lawsuitbut my father's last wish was that we should fight it to the end. Withthe aid of the son of one of his old friends now my husband we foughtand won. That is how I came into my fortune. The stories you have heardwere invented by spiteful Paris journalists."After the ladies had taken their departure for Paris the AbbConstantin was as happy as he had so lately been miserable. And as forLieutenant Reynaud the vision of their fresh and charming faces waswith him all through the military manoeuvres in which he was nowengaged. But as both of them were equally charming in his mind heconcluded he could not have fallen in love or he would have known whichhe admired the more.He did not know how many were the suitors in Paris for Miss Bettina andpossibly if he had seen the sisters among the fashionable people of thatgay city he would never have given them a second thought for he was atrue son of the country this healthy and manly young officer whosetastes were as simple as the surroundings in which he had grown updemanded.Miss Bettina indeed had only to say the word and she might have beenthe Princess Romanelli. "And I should like to be a princess for the
comment792,name sounds well" she said to herself. "Oh if I only loved him" Therewere many men of rank and title who would have been glad to have marriedthe wealthy young American lady but she found herself in love with noneof them and now she was looking forward to the fourteenth of June whenshe and her sister were to leave Paris for Longueval. During their stayat the castle they were to entertain many friends but for ten days theywere to be free to roam the woods and fields and forget thedistractions of their fashionable life in the capital."But you forget" said Madame Scott on their way to Longueval "that weare to have two people to dinner to-night.""Ah but I shall be glad to welcome both of them--particularly the younglieutenant" Bettina confessed with a touch of shyness._III.--Friendship Grows_Great alterations had been made at the castle during the month that hadelapsed. The rooms had been refurnished the stables and coach-houseswere stocked the pleasure-grounds made trim and beautiful and servantswere busy everywhere. When the abb and Jean arrived they were usheredin by two tall and dignified footmen but Madame Scott received themwith all the frankness she had shown at the vicarage and presented herson Harry and her daughter Bella who were six and five years old. ThenMiss Percival joined them and presently they were all talking togetherlike old friends. But the happiest of all was Abb Constantin. He feltat home again--too much at home--and when coffee was served on theterrace in front of the chteau after dinner he lost himself in anagreeable reverie. Then--terrible catastrophe--he fell into his oldhabit and sank into an after dinner doze as he had so often done inthe days of the marquise.Jean and Bettina found much to say to each other and as the ladies werelooking forward to riding round the estates Jean who rode every dayfor exercise promised to join them. It was quite clear that MissBettina was glad to see them both--"particularly the young lieutenant"And when Madame Scott and her sister walked up the avenue after havingaccompanied Jean and the abb to the gate Bettina confessed that sheexpected to be scolded for being so friendly with Jean."But I shall not scold you" Madame Scott said "for he has made afavourable impression on me from the first. He inspires me withconfidence.""That is just how I feel towards him" said Bettina quietly.As for Jean he talked so much to Paul about his visit that that gayyoung man accused him of having fallen in love but of course that wasmere nonsense There was no fear of Jean falling in love For a poorlieutenant could never dream of winning an heiress for his wife. Whennext he met Bettina they had a very long talk about their people and it
comment793,appeared that they were both descendants of French peasants. That waswhy Jean loved the country folk around Longueval. And when he had servedhis time in the army he thought he would retire on half-pay--an oldcolonel perhaps--and come back to live there."Always quite alone" asked Bettina."Why I hope not.""Oh then you intend to marry""Well one may think of that though one need not always be seeking tomarry.""Yet there are some who look for it I know and I have heard that youmight have married more than one girl with a handsome fortune if you hadwished.""And how do you know that" asked Jean."Monsieur le Cur told me. I soon found that nothing makes yourgodfather happier than to talk of you and in our morning walks he tellsme your history. Tell me why you refused these good marriages.""Simply because I thought it better not to marry at all than to marrywithout love" was Jean's frank avowal."I think so too" said Bettina.She looked at him. He looked at her and suddenly to the great surpriseof both they found nothing more to say. Fortunately at this momentHarry and Bella burst into the room with an invitation to see theirponies._IV.--Bettina's Confession_Three weeks during which Longueval has been crowded with visitors havepassed and the time has come for Jean to take the road for the annualartillery practice. He will be away for twenty days and while hewishes to be off he wonders how those twenty days will pass without asight of Bettina for now he frankly adores her. He is happy and he ismiserable. He knows by every action and every word that she loves him astruly as he loves her. But he feels it his duty to fight against his ownheart's wish lest the penniless lieutenant might be thought to covetthe riches of the young heiress.But he could not drag himself away without one last meeting. Yet when hesaw how anxious Bettina was to please him and make him happy with herfriendship he was afraid to hold her in his arms lest he might betempted to tell her how full his heart was with love for her. Sheexcused herself to Paul de Lavardens so that she might give his dance toJean but Jean declined the favour on the plea that he was not feelingwell and to save himself he hastened off without even shaking herhand.But all this only told his secret the more clearly to the heart thatloved him."I love him dear Susie" said Bettina that night "and I know that heloves me for myself not for the money I possess.""You are sure my dear""Yes for he will not speak he tries to avoid me. My horrid moneywhich attracts others to me is the thing that keeps him from declaringhis love.""Be very sure my dear for you know you might have been a marchionessor a princess if you had wished. You are sure you will not mind beingplain Madame Reynaud""Absolutely for I love him""Now let me make a proposal" Bettina went on. "Jean is going awayto-morrow I shall not see him for three weeks and that will be time toknow my own mind. In three weeks may I go and ask him myself if he willhave me for his wife Tell me Susie may I"Of course her sister could but consent and Bettina was happy.Next morning she had a wild desire to wave Jean a good-bye. In thepouring rain she made her way through the woods to the terrace by theroad her dress torn by the thorns and her umbrella lost to wave tohim as he passed saying to herself that this would show him how dear hewas in her thoughts.Mr. Scott had come from Paris before Jean was back and he tooapproved of Bettina's plan for they wished her to marry only one shetruly loved. But when the lieutenant came back with his regiment he hadmade up his mind to avoid meeting Bettina and had even decided to
comment794,exchange into another regiment. He refused an invitation to the chteaubut the good abb begged of him not to leave the district."Wait a little until the good God calls me. Do not go now."Jean urged that honour made it clear to him he should go away. The abbtold him that he was quite sure Bettina's heart was all for him as trulyas he believed Jean's love was all for her. Her money Jean confessedwas the great drawback as it might make others think lightly of hislove for her. Besides he was a soldier and he could not condemn her tothe life of a soldier's wife.The abb was still trying to convince his godson when there came aknock at the door and the old man opening the door admitted--BettinaShe went straight to Jean and took him by both hands saying "I must goto him first for less than three weeks ago he was suffering" The younglieutenant stood speechless. "And now to you M. le Cur let meconfess. But do not go away Jean for it is a public confession. What Ihave to say I would have said to-night at the chteau but Jean hasdeclined our invitation and So I come here to say it to M. le Cur.""I am listening mademoiselle" stammered the cur."I am rich M. le Cur and to speak the truth I like my money verymuch. I like it selfishly so to say for the joy and pleasure I have ingiving. I have always said to myself 'My husband must be worthy ofsharing this fortune' and I have also said 'I want to love the man whowill be my husband' And now I am coming to my confession.... Here is aman who for two months has done all he could to hide from me that heloves me.... Jean do you love me""Yes" murmured Jean his eyes cast down like a criminal "I love you.""I knew it." Bettina lost a little of her assurance her voice trembledslightly. She continued however with an effort. "M. le Cur I do notblame you entirely for what has happened but certainly it is partlyyour fault.""My fault""Yes your fault. I am certain you have spoken to Jean too much of memuch too much. And then you have told me too much of him. No not toomuch but quite enough I had so much confidence in you that I began toconsider him a little more closely. I began to compare him with thosewho for more than a year have sought my hand. It seemed to me that hewas their superior in every way. Then there came a day... an evening...three weeks ago the eve of your departure Jean and I found I lovedyou. Yes Jean I love you... I beg you Jean be still do not comenear me.... I have still something to say more important than all. Iknow that you love me but if you are to marry me I want your reason tosanction it. Jean I know you and I know to what I should bind myselfin becoming your wife. I know what duties what sacrifices you have tomeet in your calling. Jean do not doubt it I would not turn you fromany one of these duties these sacrifices. Never Never would I ask youto give up your career."And now M. le Cur it is not to him but to you that I speak. Tell meshould he not agree to be my husband""Jean" said the old priest gravely "marry her. It is your duty and itwill be your happiness."Jean took Bettina in his arms but she gently freed herself and said tothe abb "I wish--I wish your blessing." And the old priest replied bykissing her paternally.One month later the abb had the happiness of performing the marriage
comment795,ceremony in his little church where he had consecrated all thehappiness and goodness of his life.                                   NATHANIEL HAWTHORNEThe Scarlet Letter     Nathaniel Hawthorne American novelist and essayist was born     on July 4 1804 at Salem Massachusetts. His father a master     mariner died early and the boy grew up in a lonely country     life with his mother. He graduated at Bowdoin College but his     literary impulse had already declared itself and he retired     to Salem to write unsuccessfully for many years. Later he     held subordinate official positions in the custom-house at     Salem and lived for a few months in the Brook Farm     socialistic community. Severing his connection with the Civil     Service in 1841 it was Nathaniel Hawthorne's intention to     devote himself entirely to literature. In this he was     unsuccessful and in a short while was forced to accept a     position in the custom-house again this time as surveyor in     his native town of Salem. It was during this period he wrote     "The Scarlet Letter" published in 1850 which immediately     brought him fame and still remains the most popular of his     novels. Hawthorne himself has described how the story came to     be written. The discovery of an old manuscript by a former     surveyor and a rag of scarlet cloth which on careful     examination assumed the shape of a letter--the capital     A--gave a reasonably complete explanation of the whole affair     of "one Hester Prynne who appeared to have been rather a     noteworthy personage in the view of our ancestors." Nathaniel     Hawthorne died on May 18 1864._I.--The Pedestal of Shame_The grass-plot before the jail in Prison Lane on a certain summermorning not less than two centuries ago was occupied by a pretty largenumber of the inhabitants of Boston all with their eyes intentlyfastened on the iron-clamped oaken door.The door of the jail being flung open from within there appeared inthe first place the grim presence of the town-beadle and following hima young woman who bore in her arms a baby of some three months old.The young woman was tall and those who had known Hester Prynne beforewere astonished to perceive how her beauty shone out. On the breast ofher gown in fine red cloth surrounded with an elaborate embroidery andfantastic flourishes of gold thread appeared the letter A and it wasthat scarlet letter which drew all eyes and as it were transfiguredthe wearer.A lane was forthwith opened through the crowd of spectators. Preceded bythe beadle and attended by an irregular procession of stern-browed menand unkindly visaged women Hester Prynne set forth towards the placeappointed for her punishment. It was no great distance from the prisondoor to the market-place and in spite of the agony of her heart Hesterpassed with almost a serene deportment to the scaffold where the pillorywas set up.The crowd was sombre and grave and the unhappy prisoner sustainedherself as best a woman might under the heavy weight of a thousandunrelenting eyes.One man small in stature and of a remarkable intelligence in hisfeatures who stood on the outskirts of the crowd attracted the noticeof Hester Prynne and he in his turn bent his eyes on the prisoner tillseeing she appeared to recognise him he slowly raised his finger andlaid it on his lips.Then touching the shoulder of a townsman who stood next to him hesaid "I pray you good sir who is this woman and wherefore is shehere set up to public shame""You must needs be a stranger friend" said the townsman "else you
comment796,would surely have heard of Mistress Hester Prynne and her evil doings.She hath raised a great scandal in godly Master Dimmesdale's church. Thepenalty thereof is death. But the magistracy in their great mercy andtenderness of heart have doomed Mistress Prynne to stand only a spaceof three hours on the platform of the pillory and for the remainder ofher natural life to wear a mark of shame upon her bosom.""A wise sentence" remarked the stranger gravely. "It irks menevertheless that the partner of her iniquity should not at least standon the scaffold by her side. But he will be known--he will be known"Directly over the platform on which Hester Prynne stood was a kind ofbalcony and here sat Governor Bellingham with four sergeants about hischair and ministers of religion.Mr. John Wilson the eldest of these clergymen first spake and thenurged a younger minister Mr. Dimmesdale to exhort the prisoner torepentance and to confession. "Speak to the woman my brother" said Mr.Wilson.The Rev. Mr. Dimmesdale was a man of high native gifts whose eloquenceand religious fervour had already wide eminence in his profession. Hebent his head in silent prayer as it seemed and then came forward."Hester Prynne" said he "if thou feelest it to be for thy soul'speace I charge thee to speak out the name of thy fellow-sinner andfellow-sufferer. Be not silent from any mistaken pity and tenderness forhim for believe me though he were to step down from a high place andstand there beside thee on thy pedestal of shame yet better were it sothan to hide a guilty heart through life."Hester only shook her head."She will not speak" murmured Mr. Dimmesdale. "Wondrous strength andgenerosity of a woman's heart"Hester Prynne kept her place upon the pedestal of shame with an air ofweary indifference. With the same hard demeanour she was led back toprison.That night the child at her boson writhed in convulsions of pain andthe jailer brought in a physician whom he announced as Mr. RogerChillingworth and who was none other than the stranger whom Hester hadnoticed in the crowd.He took the infant in his arms and administered a draught and its moansand convulsive tossings gradually ceased."Hester" said he when the jailer had withdrawn "I ask not whereforethou hast fallen into the pit. It was my folly and thy weakness. Whathad I--a man of thought the bookworm of great libraries--to do withyouth and beauty like thine own I might have known that in my longabsence this would happen.""I have greatly wronged thee" murmured Hester."We have wronged each other" he answered. "But I shall seek this manwhose name thou wilt not reveal as I seek truth in books and sooner orlater he must needs be mine. I shall contrive naught against his life.Let him live Not the less shall he be mine. One thing thou that wast
comment797,my wife I ask. Thou hast kept his name secret. Keep likewise mine.Let thy husband be to the world as one already dead and breathe not thesecret above all to the man thou wottest of""I will keep thy secret as I have his."_II.--A Pearl of Great Price_When her prison-door was thrown open and she came forth into thesunshine Hester Prynne did not flee.On the outskirts of the town was a small thatched cottage and there inthis lonesome dwelling Hester established herself with her infantchild. Without a friend on earth who dared to show himself shehowever incurred no risk of want. She possessed an art that sufficed tosupply food for her thriving infant and herself--the art of needlework.By degrees her handiwork became what would now be termed the fashion.She bore on her breast in the curiously embroidered letter a specimenof her skill and her needlework was seen on the ruff of the governormilitary men wore it on their scarfs and the minister on his bands.As time went on the public attitude to Hester changed. Human nature toits credit loves more readily than it hates. Hester never battled withthe public but submitted uncomplainingly to its worst usage and so aspecies of general regard had ultimately grown up in reference to her.Hester had named the infant "Pearl" as being of great price and littlePearl grew up a wondrously lovely child with a strange lawlesscharacter. At times she seemed rather an airy sprite than human andnever did she seek to make acquaintance with other children but wasalways Hester's companion in her walks about the town.At one time some of the leading inhabitants of the place sought todeprive Hester of her child and at the governor's mansion whitherHester had repaired with some gloves which she had embroidered at hisorder the matter was discussed in the mother's presence by the governorand his guests--Mr. John Wilson Mr. Arthur Dimmesdale and old RogerChillingworth now established as a physician of great skill in thetown."God gave me the child" cried Hester. "He gave her in requital of allthings else which ye have taken from me. Ye shall not take her I willdie first Speak thou for me" she cried turning to the young clergymanMr. Dimmesdale. "Thou wast my pastor. Thou knowest what is in my heartand what are a mother's rights and how much the stronger they are whenthat mother has but her child and the scarlet letter I will not losethe child Look to it""There is truth in what she says" began the minister. "God gave her thechild and there is a quality of awful sacredness between this motherand this child. It is good for this poor sinful woman that she hath aninfant confided to her care--to be trained up by her to righteousnessto remind her and to teach her that if she bring the child to heaven
comment798,the child also will bring its parent thither. Let us then leave them asProvidence hath seen fit to place them""You speak my friend with a strange earnestness" said old RogerChillingworth smiling at him."He hath adduced such arguments that we will even leave the matter as itnow stands" said the governor. "So long at least as there shall be nofurther scandal in the woman."The affair being so satisfactorily concluded Hester Prynne with Pearldeparted._III.--The Leach and his Patient_It was at the solemn request of the deacons and elders of the church inBoston that the Rev. Mr. Dimmesdale went to Roger Chillingworth forprofessional advice. The young minister's health was failing his cheekwas paler and thinner and his voice more tremulous with everysuccessive Sabbath.Roger Chillingworth scrutinised his patient carefully and accepted asthe medical adviser determined to know the man before attempting to dohim good. He strove to go deep into his patient's bosom delving amonghis principles and prying into his recollections.After a time at a hint from old Roger Chillingworth the friends of Mr.Dimmesdale effected an arrangement by which the two men were lodged inthe same house so that every ebb and flow of the minister's life-tidemight pass under the watchful eye of his anxious physician.Old Roger Chillingworth throughout life had been calm in temperamentof kindly affections and ever in the world a pure and upright man. Hehad begun an investigation as he imagined with the severe integrity ofa judge desirous only of truth. But as he proceeded a terriblefascination seized the old man within its grip and never set him freeagain until he had done all its bidding. He now dug into the poorclergyman's heart like a miner searching for gold. "This man" thephysician would say to himself at times "pure as they deem him hathinherited a strong animal nature from his father or his mother. Let usdig a little farther in the direction of this vein."Henceforth Roger Chillingworth became not a spectator only but a chiefactor in the poor minister's inner world. And Mr. Dimmesdale grew tolook with unaccountable horror and hatred at the old physician.And still the minister's fame and reputation for holiness increasedeven while he was tortured by bodily disease and the black trouble ofhis soul.More than once Mr. Dimmesdale had gone into the pulpit with a purpose
comment799,never to come down until he should have spoken the truth of his life.And ever he put a cheat upon himself by confessing in general terms hisexceeding vileness and sinfulness. One night in early May driven byremorse and still indulging in the mockery of repentance the ministersought the scaffold where Hester Prynne had stood. The town was allasleep. There was no peril of discovery. And yet his vigil was surprisedby Hester and her daughter returning from a death-bed in the town andpresently by Roger Chillingworth himself."Who is that man" gasped Mr. Dimmesdale in terror. "I shiver at himHester. Canst thou do nothing for me I have a nameless horror of theman"Hester remembered her promise and was silent."Worthy sir" said the physician when he had advanced to the foot ofthe platform "pious Master Dimmesdale Can this be you Come good sirI pray you let me lead you home You should study less or thesenight-whimseys will grow upon you.""I will go home with you" said Mr. Dimmesdale.And now Hester Prynne resolved to do what might be in her power for thevictim whom she saw in her former husband's grip. An opportunity soonoccurred when she met the old physician stooping in quest of roots toconcoct his medicines."When we last spake together" said Hester "you bound me to secrecytouching our former relations. But now I must reveal the secret. He mustdiscern thee in thy true character. What may be the result I know not.So far as concerns the overthrow or preservation of his fair fame andhis earthly state and perchance his life he is in thy hands. Nor doI--whom the scarlet letter has disciplined to truth--nor do I perceivesuch advantage in his living any longer a life of ghastly emptinessthat I shall stoop to implore thy mercy. Do with him as thou wilt Thereis no good for him no good for me no good for thee There is no goodfor little Pearl""Woman I could well-nigh pity thee" said Roger Chillingworth."Peradventure hadst thou met earlier with a better love than mine thisevil had not been. I pity thee for the good that has been wasted in thynature""And I thee" answered Hester Prynne "for the hatred that hastransformed a wise and just man to a fiend Forgive if not for hissake then doubly for thine own""Peace Hester peace" replied the old man with gloom. "It is notgranted me to pardon. It is our fate. Now go thy ways and deal as thouwilt with yonder man."_IV.--Revelation_A week later Hester Prynne waited in the forest for the minister as hereturned from a visit to his Indian converts. He walked slowly and ashe walked kept his hand over his heart."Arthur Dimmesdale Arthur Dimmesdale" she cried out."Who speaks" answered the minister. "Hester Hester Prynne Is itthou" He fixed his eyes upon her and added "Hester hast thou foundpeace""Hast thou" she asked."None Nothing but despair What else could I look for being what I amand leading such a life as mine""You wrong yourself in this" said Hester gently. "Your sin is leftbehind you in the days long past. But Arthur an enemy dwellest withthee under the same roof. That old man--the physician whom they callRoger Chillingworth--he was my husband Forgive me. Let God punish""I do forgive you Hester" replied the minister. "May God forgive usboth"They sat down hand clasped in hand on the mossy trunk of a fallentree.It was Hester who bade him hope and spoke of seeking a new life beyondthe seas in some rural village in Europe."Oh Hester" cried Arthur Dimmesdale "I lack the strength and courageto venture out into the wide strange world alone.""Thou shalt not go alone" she whispered. Before Mr. Dimmesdale reachedhome he was conscious of a change of thought and feeling RogerChillingworth observed the change and knew that now in the minister'sregard he was no longer a trusted friend but his bitterest enemy.A New England holiday was at hand the public celebration of theelection of a new governor and the Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale was to preachthe election sermon.Hester had taken berths in a vessel that was about to sail and then on
comment800,the very day of holiday the shipmaster told her that RogerChillingworth had also taken a berth in the same vessel.Hester said nothing but turned away and waited in the crowdedmarket-place beside the pillory with Pearl while the processionre-formed after public worship. The street and the market-placeabsolutely bubbled with applause of the minister whose sermon hadsurpassed all previous utterances.At that moment Arthur Dimmesdale stood on the proudest eminence to whicha New England clergyman could be exalted. The minister surrounded bythe leading men of the town halted at the scaffold and turningtowards it cried "Hester come hither Come my little Pearl"Leaning on Hester's shoulder the minister with the child's hand inhis slowly ascended the scaffold steps."Is not this better" he murmured "than what we dreamed of in theforest For Hester I am a dying man. So let me make haste to take myshame upon me.""I know not. I know not.""Better Yea so we may both die and little Pearl die with us."He turned to the market-place and spoke with a voice that all couldhear."People of New England At last at last I stand where seven years sinceI should have stood. Lo the scarlet letter which Hester wears Ye haveall shuddered at it But there stood one in the midst of you at whosehand of sin and infamy ye have not shuddered Stand any here thatquestion God's judgement on a sinner Behold a dreadful witness of it"With a convulsive motion he tore away the ministerial gown from beforehis breast. It was revealed For an instant the multitude gazed withhorror on the ghastly miracle while the minister stood with a flush oftriumph in his face. Then down he sank upon the scaffold. Hester partlyraised him and supported his head against her bosom. Old RogerChillingworth knelt beside him."Thou hast escaped me" he repeated more than once."May God forgive thee" said the minister. "Thou too hast deeplysinned"He fixed his dying eyes on the woman and the child."My little Pearl" he said feebly "thou wilt kiss me. Hester farewell.God knows and He is merciful His will be done Farewell."That final word came forth with the minister's expiring breath. Themultitude silent till then broke out in a strange deep voice of aweand wonder.                                   After many days there was more than one account of what had beenwitnessed on the scaffold. Most of the spectators testified to havingseen on the breast of the unhappy minister a scarlet letter imprintedin the flesh. Others denied that there was any mark whatever on hisbreast more than on a new-born infant's. According to these highlyrespectable witnesses the minister's confession implied no part of the
comment801,guilt of Hester Prynne but was to teach us that we were all sinnersalike. Old Roger Chillingworth died and bequeathed his property tolittle Pearl.For years the mother and child lived in England and then Pearl marriedand Hester returned alone to the little cottage by the forest.                                   The House of the Seven Gables     "The House of the Seven Gables" published in 1851 was     written by Nathaniel Hawthorne directly after "The Scarlet     Letter" and though not equal to that remarkable book was     full worthy of its author's reputation and brought no     disappointment to those who looked for great things from his     pen. It seemed to James Russell Lowell "the highest art" to     typify "in the revived likeness of Judge Pyncheon to his     ancestor the colonel that intimate relationship between the     present and the past in the way of ancestry and descent which     historians so carefully overlook." Here as in "The Scarlet     Letter" Hawthorne is unsparing in his analysis of the meaning     of early American Puritanism--its intolerance and its     strength._I.--The Old Pyncheon Family_Half-way down a by-street of one of our New England towns stands a rustywooden house with seven acutely-peaked gables and a huge clusteredchimney in the midst. The street is Pyncheon Street the house is theold Pyncheon House and an elm tree before the door is known as thePyncheon elm.Pyncheon Street formerly bore the humbler appellation of Maule's Lanefrom the name of the original occupant of the soil before whose cottagedoor it was a cow-path. In the growth of the town however after somethirty or forty years the site covered by the rude hovel of MatthewMaule originally remote from the centre of the earlier village hadbecome exceedingly desirable in the eyes of a prominent personage whoasserted claims to the land on the strength of a grant from theLegislature. Colonel Pyncheon the claimant was a man of iron energy ofpurpose. Matthew Maule though an obscure man was stubborn in thedefense of what he considered his right. The dispute remained for yearsundecided and came to a close only with the death of old Matthew Maulewho was executed for the crime of witchcraft.It was remembered afterwards how loudly Colonel Pyncheon had joined inthe general cry to purge the land from witchcraft and had soughtzealously the condemnation of Matthew Maule. At the moment ofexecution--with the halter about his neck and while Colonel Pyncheonsat on horseback grimly gazing at the scene--Maule had addressed himfrom the scaffold and uttered a prophecy. "God" said the dying manpointing his finger at the countenance of his enemy "God will give himblood to drink"When it was understood that Colonel Pyncheon intended to erect aspacious family mansion on the spot first covered by the log-built hutof Matthew Maule the village gossips shook their heads and hinted that
comment802,he was about to build his house over an unquiet grave.But the Puritan soldier and magistrate was not a man to be turned asidefrom his scheme by dread of the reputed wizzard's ghost. He dug hiscellar and laid deep the foundations of his mansion and thehead-carpenter of the House of the Seven Gables was no other than ThomasMaule the son of the dead man from whom the right to the soil had beenwrested.On the day the house was finished Colonel Pyncheon bade all the town tobe his guests and Maude's Lane--or Pyncheon Street as it was nowcalled--was thronged at the appointed hour as with a congregation on itsway to church.But the founder of the stately mansion did not stand in his own hall towelcome the eminent persons who presented themselves in honour of thesolemn festival and the principal domestic had to explain that hismaster still remained in his study which he had entered an hour before.The lieutenant-governor took the matter into his hands and knockedboldly at the door of the colonel's private apartment and getting noanswer he tried the door which yielded to his hand and was flung wideopen by a sudden gust of wind.The company thronged to the now open door pressing thelieutenant-governor into the room before them.A large map and a portrait of Colonel Pyncheon were conspicuous on thewalls and beneath the portrait sat the colonel himself in an elbowchair with a pen in his hand.A little boy the colonel's grandchild now made his way among theguests and ran towards the seated figure then pausing halfway hebegan to shriek with terror. The company drew nearer and perceived thatthere was blood on the colonel's cuff and on his beard and an unnaturaldistortion in his fixed stare. It was too late to render assistance. Theiron-hearted Puritan the relentless persecutor the grasping andstrong-willed man was dead Dead in his new houseColonel Pyncheon's sudden and mysterious end made a vast deal of noisein its day. There were many rumours and a great dispute of doctors overthe dead body. But the coroner's jury sat upon the corpse and likesensible men returned an unassailable verdict of "Sudden Death."The son and heir came into immediate enjoyment of a considerable estatebut a claim to a large tract of country in Waldo County Maine whichthe colonel had he lived would undoubtedly have made good was lost byhis decease. Some connecting link had slipped out of the evidence andcould not be found. Still from generation to generation the Pyncheonscherished an absurd delusion of family importance on the strength ofthis impalpable claim and from father to son they clung with tenacityto the ancestral house for the better part of two centuries.The most noted event in the Pyncheon annals in the last fifty years hadbeen the violent death of the chief member of the family--an old andwealthy bachelor. One of his nephews Clifford was found guilty of themurder and was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment. This had happenedthirty years ago and there were now rumours that the long-buriedcriminal was about to be released. Another nephew had become the heirand was now a judge in an inferior court. The only members of the familyknown to be extant besides the judge and the thirty years' prisonerwere a sister of the latter wretchedly poor who lived in the House of
comment803,the Seven Gables by the will of the old bachelor and the judge's singlesurviving son now travelling in Europe. The last and youngest Pyncheonwas a little country girl of seventeen whose father--another of thejudge's cousins--was dead and whose mother had taken another husband._II.--The House without Sunshine_Miss Hepzibah Pyncheon was reduced to the business of setting up apretty shop and that in the Pyncheon house where she had spent all herdays. After sixty years of idleness and seclusion she must earn herbread or starve and to keep shop was the only resource open to her.The first customer to cross the threshold was a young man to whom oldHepzibah let certain remote rooms in the House of the Seven Gables. Heexplained that he had looked in to offer his best wishes and to see ifhe could give any assistance.Poor Hepzibah when she heard the kindly tone of his voice began tosob."Ah Mr. Holgrave" she cried "I never can go through with it Nevernever never I wish I were dead in the old family tomb with all myforefathers--yes and with my brother who had far better find me therethan here I am too old too feeble and too hopeless If old Maule'sghost or a descendant of his could see me behind the counter to-dayhe would call it the fulfilment of his worst wishes. But I thank you foryour kindness Mr. Holgrave and will do my utmost to be a goodshopkeeper."On Holgrave asking for half a dozen biscuits Hepzibah put them into hishand but rejected the compensation."Let me be a lady a moment longer" she said with a manner of antiquestateliness. "A Pyncheon must not--at all events under her forefathers'roof--receive money for a morsel of bread from her only friend."As the day went on the poor lady blundered hopelessly with hercustomers and committed the most unheard-of errors so that the wholeproceeds of her painful traffic amounted at the close to half a dozencoppers.That night the little country cousin Phoebe Pyncheon arrived at thegloomy old house. Hepzibah knew that circumstances made it desirable forthe girl to establish herself in another home but she was reluctant tobid her stay."Phoebe" she said on the following morning "this house of mine is buta melancholy place for a young person to be in. It lets in the wind andrain and the snow too in the winter time but it never lets in thesunshine And as for myself you see what I am--a dismal and lonesomeold woman whose temper is none of the best and whose spirits are asbad as can be. I cannot make your life pleasant Cousin Phoebe neithercan I so much as give you bread to eat.""You will find me a cheerful little body" answered Phoebe smiling
comment804,"and I mean to earn my bread. You know I have not been brought up aPyncheon. A girl learns many things in a New England village.""Ah Phoebe" said Hepzibah sighing "it is a wretched thought that youshould fling away your young days in a place like this. And after allit is not even for me to say who shall be a guest or inhabitant of theold Pyncheon house. Its master is coming.""Do you mean Judge Pyncheon" asked Phoebe in surprise."Judge Pyncheon" answered her cousin angrily. "He will hardly cross thethreshold while I live. You shall see the face of him I speak of."She went in quest of a miniature and returned and placed it in Phoebe'shand."How do you like the face" asked Hepzibah."It is handsome it is very beautiful" said Phoebe admiringly. "It isas sweet a face as a man's can be or ought to be. Who is it CousinHepzibah""Did you never hear of Clifford Pyncheon""Never. I thought there were no Pyncheons left except yourself and ourCousin Jaffrey the judge. And yet I seem to have heard the name ofClifford Pyncheon. Yes from my father or my mother. But hasn't he beendead a long while""Well well child perhaps he has" said Hepzibah with a sad hollowlaugh "but in old houses like this you know dead people are very aptto come back again. And Cousin Phoebe if your courage does not failyou we will not part soon. You are welcome to such a home as I canoffer you."_III.--Miss Hepzibah's Guests_The day after Phoebe's arrival there was a constant tremor in Hepzibah'sframe. With all her affection for a young cousin there was a recurringirritability."Bear with me my dear child" she cried "bear with me for I love youPhoebe and truly my heart is full to the brim By-and-by I shall bekind and only kind.""What has happened" asked Phoebe. "What is it that moves you so""Hush He is coming" whispered Hepzibah. "Let him see you firstPhoebe for you are young and rosy and cannot help letting a smilebreak out. He always liked bright faces. And mine is old now and thetears are hardly dry on it. Draw the curtain a little but let there bea good deal of sunshine too. He has had but little sunshine in hislife poor Clifford and oh what a black shadow Poor--poor Clifford"There was a step in the passage-way above stairs. It seemed to Phoebethe same that she had heard in the night as in a dream. Very slowly thesteps came downstairs and paused for a long time at the door.Hepzibah unable to endure the suspense rushed forward threw open thedoor and led in the stranger by the hand. At the first glance Phoebesaw an elderly man in an old-fashioned dressing gown with grey hairalmost white of an unusual length. The expression of his countenanceseemed to waver glimmer and nearly to die away and feebly to recoveritself again."Dear Clifford" said Hepzibah "this is our Cousin Phoebe Arthur'sonly child you know. She has come from the country to stay with us awhile for our old house has grown to be very lonely now.""Phoebe Arthur's child" repeated the guest. "Ah I forget No matter.She is very welcome." He seated himself in the place assigned him andlooked strangely around. His eyes met Hepzibah's and he seemedbewildered and disgusted. "Is this you Hepzibah" he murmured sadly."How changed how changed""There is nothing but love here Clifford" Hepzibah saidsoftly--"nothing but love. You are at home."The guest responded to her tone by a smile which but half lit up his
comment805,face. It was followed by a coarser expression and he ate his food withfierce voracity and asked for "more--more"That day Phoebe attended to the shop and the second person to enter itwas a gentleman of portly figure and high respectability."I was not aware that Miss Hepzibah Pyncheon had commenced businessunder such favourable auspices" he said in a deep voice "You are herassistant I suppose""I certainly am" answered Phoebe. "I am a cousin of Miss Hepzibah on avisit to her.""Her cousin and from the country" said the gentleman bowing andsmiling. "In that case we must be better acquainted for you are my ownlittle kinswoman likewise. Let me see you must be Phoebe the onlychild of my dear Cousin Arthur. I am your kinsman my dear. Surely youmust have heard of Judge Pyncheon"Phoebe curtsied and the judge bent forward to bestow a kiss on hisyoung relative. But Phoebe drew back there was something repulsive toher in the judge's demonstration and on raising her eyes she wasstartled by the change in Judge Pyncheon's face. It had become coldhard and immitigable."Dear me What is to be done now" thought the country girl to herself."He looks as if there were nothing softer in him than a rock nor milderthan the east wind."Then all at once it struck Phoebe that this very Judge Pyncheon was theoriginal of a miniature which Mr. Holgrave--who took portraits andwhose acquaintance she had made within a few hours of her arrival--hadshown her yesterday. There was the same hard stern relentless look onthe face. In reality the miniature was copied from an old portrait ofColonel Pyncheon which hung within the house. Was it that the expressionhad been transmitted down as a precious heirloom from that Puritanancestor in whose picture both the expression and to a singulardegree the features of the modern judge were shown as by a kind ofprophecyBut as it happened scarcely had Phoebe's eyes rested again on thejudge's countenance than all its ugly sternness vanished and she foundherself almost overpowered by the warm benevolence of his look. But thefantasy would not quit her that the original Puritan of whom she hadheard so many sombre traditions had now stepped into the shop."You seem to be a little nervous this morning" said the judge. "Hasanything happened to disturb you--anything remarkable in CousinHepzibah's family--an arrival eh I thought so To be an inmate withsuch a guest may well startle an innocent young girl""You quite puzzle me sir" replied Phoebe. "There is no frightful guestin the house but only a poor gentle child-like man whom I believe tobe Cousin Hepzibah's brother. I am afraid that he is not quite in hissound senses but so mild he seems to be that a mother might trust her
comment806,baby with him. He startle me Oh no indeed""I rejoice to hear so favourable and so ingenious an account of myCousin Clifford" said the benevolent judge. "It is possible that youhave never heard of Clifford Pyncheon and know nothing of his history.But is Clifford in the parlour I will just step in and see him. Thereis no need to announce me. I know the house and know my CousinHepzibah and her brother Clifford likewise. Ah there is Hepzibahherself"Such was the case. The vibrations of the judge's voice had reached theold gentlewoman in the parlour where Clifford sat slumbering in hischair."He cannot see you" said Hepzibah with quivering voice. "He cannot seevisitors.""A visitor--do you call me so" cried the judge. "Then let me beClifford's host and your own likewise. Come at once to my house. I haveoften invited you before. Come and we will labour together to makeClifford happy.""Clifford has a home here" she answered."Woman" broke out the judge "what is the meaning of all this Have youother resources Take care Hepzibah take care Clifford is on thebrink of as black a ruin as ever befel him yet"From within the parlour sounded a tremulous wailing voice indicatinghelpless alarm."Hepzibah" cried the voice. "Entreat him not to come in. Go down onyour knees to him. Oh let him have mercy on me Mercy"The judge withdrew and Hepzibah deathly white staggered towardsPhoebe."That man has been the horror of my life" she murmured. "Shall I neverhave courage enough to tell him what he is"_IV.--The Spell is Broken_The shop thrived under Phoebe's management and the acquaintance withMr. Holgrave ripened into friendship.Then after some weeks Phoebe went away on a temporary visit to hermother and the old house which had been brightened by her presencewas once more dark and gloomy.It was during this absence of Phoebe's that Judge Pyncheon once morecalled and demanded to see Clifford."You cannot see him" answered Hepzibah. "Clifford has kept his bedsince yesterday.""What Clifford ill" said the judge starting. "Then I must and willsee him"The judge explained the reason for his urgency. He believed thatClifford could give the clue to the dead uncle's wealth of which notmore than a half had been mentioned in his will. If Clifford refused toreveal where the missing documents were placed the judge declared hewould have him confined in a public asylum as a lunatic for there weremany witnesses of Clifford's simple childlike ways."You are stronger than I" said Hepzibah "and you have no pity in yourstrength. Clifford is not now insane but the interview which you insistupon may go far to make him so. Nevertheless I will call Clifford"Hepzibah went in search of her brother and Judge Pyncheon flung himselfdown in an old chair in the parlour. He took his watch from his pocketand held it in his hand. But Clifford was not in his room nor couldHepzibah find him. She returned to the parlour calling out to the judgeas she came to rise and help find Clifford.But the judge never moved and Clifford appeared at the door pointinghis finger at the judge and laughing with strange excitement."Hepzibah" he said "we can dance now We can sing laugh play do
comment807,what we will The weight is gone Hepzibah--gone off this weary oldworld and we may be as lighthearted as little Phoebe herself What anabsurd figure the old fellow cuts now just when he fancied he had mecompletely under his thumb"Then the brother and sister departed hastily from the house and leftJudge Pyncheon sitting in the old house of his forefathers.Phoebe and Holgrave were in the house together when the brother andsister returned and Holgrave had told her of the judge's sudden death.Then in that hour so full of doubt and awe the one miracle waswrought without which every human existence is a blank and the blisswhich makes all things true beautiful and holy shone around this youthand maiden. They were conscious of nothing sad or old.Presently the voices of Clifford and Hepzibah were heard at the doorand when they entered Clifford appeared the stronger of the two."It is our own little Phoebe Ah And Holgrave with her" he exclaimed."I thought of you both as we came down the street. And so the flower ofEden has bloomed even in this old darksome house to-day."A week after the judge's death news came of the death of his son and soHepzibah became rich and so did Clifford and so did Phoebe andthrough her Holgrave.It was far too late for the formal vindication of Clifford's characterto be worth the trouble and anguish involved. For the truth was that theuncle had died by a sudden stroke and the judge knowing this had letsuspicion and condemnation fall on Clifford only because he had himselfbeen busy among the dead man's papers destroying a later will made outin Clifford's favour and because it was found the papers had beendisturbed to avert suspicion from the real offender he had let theblame fall on his cousin.Clifford was content with the love of his sister and Phoebe andHolgrave. The good opinion of society was not worth publicly reclaiming.It was Holgrave who discovered the missing document the judge had sethis heart on obtaining."And now my dearest Phoebe" said Holgrave "how will it please you toassume the name of Maule In this long drama of wrong and retribution Irepresent the old wizzard and am probably as much of a wizzard as evermy ancestor was."Then with Hepzibah and Clifford Phoebe and Holgrave left the old housefor ever.                                   ROBERT HICHENSThe Garden of Allah     The son of a clergyman Mr. Robert Smythe Hichens born at     Speldhurst Kent England on November 14 1864 was     originally intended to follow a musical career but after some     years abandoned music for journalism. His first long novel was     written and published at the age of seventeen. It attracted     little or no attention and has long been out of print. A trip     to Egypt in 1893 resulted in a burning desire to become a     novelist and his brilliant satire "The Green Carnation"     followed. The book was written in a month and at once     established its author's name and fame. "The Garden of Allah"     of all Mr. Hichens' works the most typical of his genius     appeared in 1905. "The intellectual grip of the story" says     one critic "cannot be denied for it completely conquers the     critical sense and the ideas of the author insinuate     themselves as it were among one's inmost thoughts." Yet Mr.     Hichens' stories are popular not only with literary     connoisseurs but also with the general public inasmuch as     they owe their fascination not so much to an extreme     refinement of art as to their freshness of imagination and
comment808,     dramatic intensity. This epitome of the "Garden of Allah" has     been prepared by Mr. Hichens himself._I.--The Home of Peace_On an autumn evening Domini Enfilden leaned on the parapet of averandah of the Hotel du Dsert at Beni-Mora in Southern Algeriagazing towards the great Sahara which was lit up by the glory ofsunset. The bell of the Catholic Church chimed. She heard the throbbingof native drums in the village near by. Tired with her long journey fromEngland she watched and listened while the twilight crept among thepalms and the sandy alleys grew dark.Thirty-two an orphan unmarried strong fearless ardent but a deeplyreligious woman and a Catholic Domini had passed through much mentalagony. Her mother Lady Rens a member of one of England's oldestCatholic families but half Hungarian on the mother's side had run awaywhen Domini was nineteen with a Hungarian musician leaving her onlychild with her despairing and abandoned husband. Lord Rens had become aCatholic out of love for his wife. When he was deserted by her hefuriously renounced his faith and eventually died blaspheming. In vainthrough many years he had tried to detach his daughter from the religionof her guilty mother now long since dead. Domini had known how toresist but the cruel contest had shaken her body and soul.Now free alone she had left England to begin a new life far away fromthe scene of her misery. Vaguely she had thought of the great desertcalled by the Arabs "The Garden of Allah" as the home of peace. She hadtravelled there to find peace. That day at the gate of the desert shehad met a traveller Doris Androvsky a man of about thirty-sixpowerfully built tanned by the sun. When she was about to get into thetrain at the station of El Akbara this man had rudely sprung in beforeher. The train had begun to move and Domini had sprung into it almostat the risk of her life. Androvsky had not offered to help her had notsaid a word of apology. His _gaucherie_ had almost revolted Domini.Nevertheless something powerful mournful passionate and sincere inhis personality had affected her roused her interest.Silently they had come into the desert together strangers almost atenmity the one with the other. They were now staying in the same hotelin this oasis in the desert of Sahara.In coming to the hotel Domini had seen a curious incident. Androvskywith a guide who carried his bag was walking before her down the longpublic garden when in the distance there appeared the black figure ofthe priest of Beni-Mora advancing slowly towards them. When Androvskysaw the priest he had stopped short hesitated then despite theprotests of his guide had abruptly turned down a side path and hurriedaway. He had fled from the man of prayer.Now as the twilight fell Domini thought of this incident and when sheheard Androvsky's heavy tread upon the stairs of the verandah the sharpclosing of the French window of his room she was filled with a vagueuneasiness.Next day she visited a wonderful garden on the edge of the desertbelonging to a Count Anteoni a recluse who loved the Arabs and spentmuch of his time among them. There standing with the count by thegarden wall at the hour of the Mohammedan's prayer she had seenAndrovsky again. He was in the desert with a Nomad. The cry of the_muezzin_ went up to the brazen sky. The Nomad fell on his knees and
comment809,prayed. Androvsky started gazed shrank back then turned and strodeaway like one horrified by some grievous vision. Domini said to thecount "I have just seen a man flee from prayer it was horrible."He answered her very gravely "The man who is afraid of prayer isunwise to set foot beyond the palm-trees for the desert is the gardenof Allah."That evening Domini and Androvsky spoke to each other for the firsttime on the top of a tower where they had come to see the sunset.Domini spoke first moved by a strange look of loneliness ofdesolation in Androvsky's eyes. He replied in a low voice and askedher pardon for his rude conduct at the station. Then abruptly hedescended the tower and disappeared.At night she visited a dancing house to see the strange dances of thedesert. She found Androvsky there watching the painted women as if halffascinated half horrified by them. Irena a girl who had been banishedfrom Beni-Mora for threatening to murder an Arab of whom she wasjealous but had been permitted to return discovering him among theaudience stabbed him. There was a violent scene during whichAndrovsky forcing his way through the desert men protected Domini fromthe crush. The crowd rushed out leaving them alone together. Androvskyinsisted on escorting Domini back to the hotel._II.--Defying Allah in Allah's Garden_The acquaintance thus unconventionally began between them continued andripened into a strange friendship. Domini was a magnificent horsewoman.Finding that Androvsky did not know how to ride she gave him lessons.Together they galloped over the desert sands together they visited theSaharan villages hidden in the groves of date palms behind the brownearthen walls of the oasis together watched the burning sunsets ofAfrica at meal-times they met in the hotel in the evenings they satupon the verandah and heard the Zouaves singing in chorus the distantmurmur of the tom-toms.Domini became profoundly interested in Androvsky but her interest wascomplicated by wonder at his peculiarities at his uncouth manners hisstrange silences his ignorance of life and of social matters hisdistrust of others his desire to keep aloof from all human beingsexcept herself. The good priest now her intimate friend Count Anteonialso her friend and respectful admirer were ill at ease with him. Hehad tried to avoid them but Domini anxious to bring some pleasure intohis life had introduced him to them at a luncheon given by the count inhis garden despite Androvsky's dogged assertion that he disliked
comment810,priests and did not care for social intercourse.At this lunch Androvsky had been brusque on the defensive almostactively disagreeable. And when after the priest's departure he leftDomini alone with Count Anteoni she felt almost relieved. Count Anteonisummoned a sand-diviner to read Domini's fate in the sand. This man--athin fanatical Eastern with piercing and cruel eyes--spread out hissand brought from the tomb of a Mohammedan saint and prophesied. Hedeclared that he saw a great sand-storm and in it a train of camelswaiting by a church. From the church came the sound of music nearlydrowned by the roar of the wind. In the church the real life of Dominiwas beginning. The music ceased darkness fell. Then the diviner sawDomini with a companion mounted on one of the camels and disappearinginto the storm towards the south. The face of her companion was hidden.Finally he saw Domini far out in the desert among great dunes of whitesand. In her heart there was joy. It was as if all the date palms boretheir fruit together and in all the desert places water-springs burstforth. But presently a figure came towards her walking heavily and allthe dates shrivelled upon the palms and all the springs dried up.Sorrow and terror were there beside her.At this point in the diviner's prophecy Domini stopped him. Afterwardsshe explained to Anteoni that she felt as if another's fate was beingread in it as well as her own as if to listen any more might be tointrude upon another's secret.Upon the following day Anteoni left Beni-Mora to make a long desertjourney to a sacred city called Amara. Domini went to his garden at dawnto see him off. Before departing he warned Domini to beware ofAndrovsky. She asked him why. He answered that Androvsky seemed to him aman who was at odds with life with himself with his Creator a man whowas defying Allah in Allah's garden. When Anteoni had gone Domini insome perplexity of spirit and moved by a longing for sympathy and helpvisited the priest in his house near the church. The priest indirectlyalso warned her against Androvsky and a little later frankly told herthat he felt an invincible dislike to him."I have no reason to give" said the priest. "My instinct is my reason.I feel it my duty to say that I advise you most earnestly to break offyour acquaintance with Monsieur Androvsky."Domini said "It is strange ever since I have been here I have felt asif everything that has happened had been arranged beforehand as if ithad to happen and I feel that too about the future.""Count Anteoni's fatalism" exclaimed the priest. "It is the guidingspirit of this land. And you too are going to be led by it. Take careYou have come to a land of fire and I think you are made of fire."The warnings of Anteoni and the priest made an impression on Domini. Shewas conscious of how the outside world would be likely to regard heracquaintance with Androvsky. Suddenly she saw Androvsky as some strangeand ghastly figure of legend as the wandering Jew met by a traveller atcross roads and distinguished for an instant by an oblique flash oflightning as the shrouded Arab of the Eastern tale who announcescoming disaster to the wanderers in the desert by beating a death-rollon a drum amid the sands.And she felt upon her the heavy hand of some strange perhaps terriblefate._III.--The Eternal Song of Love_That same night accompanied by Batouch Domini rode out into the desertto see the rising of the moon and there met Androvsky. He had followedthem on horseback. Domini dismissed Batouch at Androvsky's reiteratedrequest. When they were alone in the sands Androvsky told Domini thathe had needed to be with her as he had something to tell her. On themorrow he was going away from Beni-Mora.His face while he said this was turned from Domini and his voicesounded as if it spoke to some one at a distance some one who can hearas man cannot hear.Domini said little. But at the sound of his words it seemed to her as ifall outside things she had ever known had foundered as if with them hadfoundered too all the bodily powers that were of the essence of her
comment811,life. And the desert which she had so loved was no longer to her thedesert sand with a soul in it blue distances full of a music ofsummons but only a barren waste of dried-up matter featurelessdesolate ghastly with the bones of things that had died.She rode back with Androvsky to Beni-Mora in a silence like that ofdeath.But this parting decreed by the man was not to be. In the desert thesetwo human beings had grown to love each other with a love that hadbecome a burning passion. And next day when in the garden of CountAnteoni Androvsky came to say farewell to Domini his love broke allbarriers. He sank on the sand letting his hands slip down till theyclasped Domini's knees."I love you" he said. "I love you. But don't listen to me. You mustn'thear it. You mustn't. But I must say it. I can't go till I say it. Ilove you I love you""I am listening" she said. "I must hear it."Androvsky rose up put his hands behind Domini held her set his lipson hers pressing his whole body against hers."Hear it" he said muttering against her lips. "Hear it I love you Ilove you"In the recesses of the garden Larbi that idle gardener played upon hislittle flute his eternal song of love and from the desert beyond thewhite wall there rose an Arab's voice singing a song of the Sahara "Noone but God and I knows what is in my heart"_IV.--A Nomad's Honeymoon_As the sand-diviner had foretold Domini and Androvsky were married inthe church of Beni-Mora and by the priest who had warned Domini to havenothing more to do with Androvsky. A terrible sand-storm was raging andthe desert was blotted out. Nevertheless when the ceremony was overthe bride and bridegroom mounted upon a camel and with theirattendants set out for their desert honeymoon. Standing before the doorof the church the good priest watched them go with fear in his heartand that night in his humble home kneeling before his crucifix heprayed long and earnestly for all wanderers in the desert.Isolated from all who knew them free from all social ties nomads asare the Bedouins who make their dwelling for ever amid the vast andburning sands Domini and Androvsky entered upon their married life. Andat first one of them was happy as few are ever happy. Domini loved
comment812,completely trusted completely lived with a fulness a completeness shehad never known till now. That Androvsky almost worshipped her sheknew. His conduct to her was perfect. And yet there were times whenDomini felt as if a shadow rose between them as if even with her insome secret place of his soul Androvsky was ill at ease as if sometimeshe suffered and dared not tell his suffering.One day in their wanderings they came to a desolate place calledMogar and camped on a sandhill looking over a vast stretch of dunes.Towards evening Androvsky descended into the plain to shoot gazelleleaving Domini alone. While he was away a French officer with two menof the Zouaves rode slowly up. They were nearly starving and terriblyexhausted having been lost in a sand-storm for three days and nights.Pitying their sufferings Domini insisted on entertaining them. The menmust sup with the Arabs the officer must dine with herself andAndrovsky. The officer accepted with gratitude and went off to make histoilet. When Androvsky returned Domini told him of the officer'sarrival and when he saw the three places laid for dinner in the tenthe seemed profoundly disturbed. He asked the officer's name. Domini toldhim Trevignac."Trevignac" he exclaimed.Then hearing the soldiers coming he turned away abruptly anddisappeared into the bedroom tent.Trevignac came up and in a few minutes Androvsky reappeared. The twomen gazed at each other for an instant. Then Domini introduced them andthey all sat down to dinner. Conversation was uneasy. Androvsky wasevidently ill at ease Trevignac was distrait at moments strangelywatchful of his host at other moments. Dinner over Domini left the twomen together to smoke and went out on to the sand. She met an Arabcarrying coffee and a liqueur to the tent."What's that Ouardi" she asked touching the bottle.He told her it was an African liqueur."Take it in" she said.And she strolled away to the bonfire to listen to the fantasia the Arabswere making in honour of the soldiers.When she returned to the tent she found her husband alone in itstanding up with a quantity of fragments of glass lying at his feet.Near him was the coffee untasted. Trevignac was gone. She asked for anexplanation. He gave her none. The fragments of glass were all thatremained of the bottle which had contained the liqueur.At dawn Domini met Trevignac riding away with his soldiers. He salutedher bidding his men ride on. As he gazed at her she seemed to seehorror in his eyes. Twice he tried to speak but apparently could notbring himself to do so. He looked towards the tent where Androvsky wassleeping then at Domini then as if moved by an irresistible impulsehe leaned from his saddle made over Domini the sign of the cross and
comment813,rode away into the desert._V.--I Have Insulted God_From that day Androvsky's strange misery of the soul strange horror ofthe world increased. Domini felt that he was secretly tormented. Shetried to make him happier she even told him that she believed he oftenfelt far away from God and that she prayed each day for him."Boris" she said "if it's that don't be too sad. It may all comeright in the desert. For the desert is the garden of Allah."He made her no answer.At last in their journeying they came to the sacred city of Amara andcamped in the white sands beyond it.This was the place described by the sand-diviner and here Domini knewthat her love was to be crowned that she would become a mother. Shehesitated to tell her husband for in this place his misery and fear ofmen seemed mounting to a climax. Nevertheless as if in a franticattempt to get the better of his mental torture he had gone off sayinghe wanted to see the city.While he was away Domini was visited first by Count Anteoni who toldher that he had joined the Mohammedan religion and was at last happyand at peace secondly when night had fallen by the priest of Amara.This man was talkative and genial fond of the good things of life.Domini offered him a cigar. He accepted it. An Arab brought coffee andthe same African liqueur which had been taken to the tent on the nightwhen Trevignac had dined with Domini and Androvsky.When the priest was about to drink some of it he suddenly paused andput the glass down. Domini leant forward."Louarine" she said reading the name on the bottle. "Won't you havesome""The fact is madame" began the priest with hesitation "this liqueurcomes from the Trappist monastery of El Largani.""Yes""It was made by a monk and priest to whom the secret of its manufacturebelonged. At his death he was to confide the secret to another whom hehad chosen. But the monks of El Largani will never earn another franc byLouarine when what they have in stock is exhausted.""The monk died suddenly""Madame he ran away from the monastery after being there in the eternalsilence for twenty years after taking the final vows.""How horrible" said Domini. "That man must be in hell now in the hella man can make for himself by his own act."As she spoke Androvsky appeared by the tent door. He was lookingfrightfully ill and like a desperate man. When the priest had goneDomini told Androvsky about the liqueur and the disappearance of theTrappist monk. As she spoke his face grew more ghastly. He stood rigidas if with horror."Poor poor man" she said as she finished her story."You--you pity that man then" murmured Androvsky."Yes" she replied. "I was thinking of the agony he must be enduring ifhe is still alive."Androvsky seemed painfully moved and almost as if he were on the vergeof some passionate outburst of emotion and something like a deep voicefar down in the loving heart of Domini said to her "If you really lovebe fearless. Attack the sorrow which stands like a figure of deathbetween you and your husband. Drive it away. You have a weapon--faith--use it"At last she summoned all her courage all her faith and she forced fromAndrovsky the confession of what it was which held him in perpetualmisery even in freedom even with her whom he loved beyond and aboveall human beings."Domini" he said "you want to know what it is that makes me unhappyeven in our love--desperately unhappy. It is this. I believe in God Ilove God I have insulted God. I have tried to forget God to deny Himto put human love higher than love for Him. But always I am haunted bythe thought of God and that thought makes me despair. Once when I wasyoung I gave myself to God solemnly. I have broken the vows I made Igave myself to God as a monk.""You are the Trappist" she whispered. "You are the monk from themonastery of El Largani who disappeared after twenty years""Yes" he said "I am he."Standing there in the sands while the world was wrapped in sleepAndrovsky told Domini the whole story of his life in the monastery ofhis innocent happiness there and of the events which woke up within him
comment814,the mad longing to see life and the world and to know the love ofwoman. He told her of his secret departure by night from the monasteryof his journey to the desert in search of complete and savage liberty.He told her how he had fought against his growing love for her how hehad tried to leave her how at the last moment in the garden by nighthis passion for her had conquered him and driven him to her feet. Hetold her how the officer Trevignac had known him long ago in themonastery and had recognised him when the Arab brought in the liqueurwhich he had made. He kept nothing from her."That last day in the garden" he said finally "I thought I hadconquered myself and it was in that moment that I fell for ever. When Iknew you loved me I could fight no more. You have seen me you havelived with me you have divined my misery. But don't think Domini thatit ever came from you. It was the consciousness of my lie to you my lieto God that--that--I can't tell you--I can't tell you--you know."He looked into her face then turned to go away into the desert."I'll go I'll go" he muttered.Then Domini spoke."Boris" she said.He stopped."Boris now at last you can pray."She went into the tent and left him alone. He knew that in the tent shewas praying for him. He stood trying to listen to her prayer thenwith an uncertain hand he felt in his breast. He drew out a woodencross given to him by his mother when he entered the monastery. He bentdown his head touched it with his lips and fell upon his knees in thedesert.From that night Domini realised that her duty was plain before her.Androvsky was still at heart a monk and she was a fervently religiouswoman. She put God above herself above her poor desperate human loveabove Androvsky and his passionate love for her. She put the things ofeternity before the things of time. She never told Androvsky of thechild that was coming.After he had made his confession to the priest of Beni-Mora who hadmarried them she led him to the monastery door and there they partedfor ever on earth to be reunited as both believed in heaven.And now in the garden of Count Anteoni which has passed into otherhands a little boy may often be seen playing.
comment815,Sometimes when twilight is falling over the Sahara his mother callshim to her to the white wall from which she looks out over the desert."Listen Boris" she whispers.The little boy leans his face against her breast and obeys.An Arab is passing below on the desert track singing to himself as hegoes towards his home in the oasis "No one but God and I knows what isin my heart."The mother whispers the words to herself. The cool wind of the nightblows over the vast spaces of the Sahara and touches her cheekreminding her of her glorious days of liberty of the passion that cameto her soul like fire in the desert.But she does not rebel for always when night falls she sees the formof a man praying one who once fled from prayer in the desert she seesa wanderer who at last has reached his home.                                   OLIVER WENDELL HOLMESElsie Venner     Oliver Wendell Holmes essayist poet scientist and one of     the most lovable men who have adorned the literature of the     English tongue was born at Cambridge Massachusetts Aug. 29     1809 of a New England family with a record in which he took     great pride. After studying medicine at Harvard he went to     Europe on a prolonged tour and returning took his M.D. and     became a popular professor of anatomy. He had some repute as a     graceful poet in his student days. "Elsie Venner" at first     called "The Professor's Story" was published in 1861 and was     the first sustained work of fiction that came from the pen of     Oliver Wendell Holmes. Illumined by admirable pictures of life     and character in a typical New England town the book itself     is a remarkable study of heredity--a study only relieved by     the author's kindly humour. The unfortunate child doomed     before her birth to suffer from the fatal bite of a     rattlesnake--an incident unduly extravagant in some critics'     opinions--and only throwing off the evil influence on her     death-bed is one of the most pathetic figures in all American     literature. It was not until seven years later that "Elsie     Venner" was followed by another novel "The Guardian Angel" a     story which is worked out on the same lines of thought as the     former. Holmes died on October 7 1894._I.--The Eyes of Elsie Venner_Mr. Bernard Langdon duly certificated had accepted the invitation fromthe Board of Trustees of the Apollinean Female Institute a school forthe education of young ladies situated in the nourishing town ofRockland.Rockland is at the foot of a mountain and a horrible feature of this
comment816,mountain was the region known as Rattlesnake Ledge which was stilltenanted by those horrible reptiles in spite of many a foray by thetownspeople.That the brood was not extirpated there was a melancholy proof in theyear 184-- when a young married woman detained at home by the state ofher health was bitten in the entry of her own house by a rattlesnakewhich had found its way down from the mountain. Owing to the almostinstant employment of powerful remedies the bite did not proveimmediately fatal but she died within a few months of the time when shewas bitten.It was on a fine morning that Mr. Langdon made his appearance as masterfor the English branches in the great school-room of the ApollineanInstitute. The principal Mr. Silas Peckham carried him to the desk ofthe young lady assistant Miss Darley by name and introduced him toher. The young lady assistant had to point out to the new master thewhole routine of the classes and Mr. Langdon had a great many questionsto ask relating to his new duties. The truth is the general effect ofthe school-room with its scores of young girls was enough to confuse ayoung man like Mr. Langdon and he may be pardoned for asking MissDarley questions about his scholars as well as about their lessons.He asked who one or two girls were and being answered went on "Andwho and what is that sitting a little apart there--that strangewild-looking girl"The lady teacher's face changed one would have said she was frightenedor troubled. The girl did not look up she was winding a gold chainabout her wrist and then uncoiling it as if in a kind of reverie. MissDarley drew close to the master and placed her hand so as to hide herlips."Don't look at her as if we were talking about her" she whisperedsoftly "that is Elsie Venner."A girl of about seventeen tall slender was Elsie Venner. Blackpiercing eyes black hair twisted in heavy braids a face that onecould not help looking at for its beauty yet that one wanted to lookaway from and could not for those diamond eyes.Those eyes were fixed on the lady teacher one morning not long afterLangdon's arrival. Miss Darley turned her own away and let them wanderover the other scholars. But the diamond eyes were on her still. Sheturned the leaves of several of her books and finally following someill-defined impulse which she could not resist left her place and wentto the young girl's desk."What do you want of me Elsie Venner" It was a strange question toput for the girl had not signified that she wished the teacher to cometo her."Nothing" she cried. "I thought I could make you come." The girl spokein a low tone a kind of half-whisper.Bernard Langdon experienced the power of those diamond eyes oneparticular day that summer.He had made up his mind to explore the dreaded Rattlesnake Ledge of themountain to examine the rocks and perhaps to pick up an adventure inthe zoological line for he had on a pair of high stout boots and hecarried a stick in his hand.High up on one of the precipitous walls of rock he saw some tufts offlowers and knew them for flowers Elsie Venner had brought into theschool-room. Presently on a natural platform where he sat down to resthe found a hairpin.He rose up from his seat to look round for other signs of a woman'svisits and walked to the mouth of a cavern and looked into it. His look
comment817,was met by the glitter of two diamond eyes shining out of the darknessbut gliding with a smooth steady motion towards the light and himself.He stood fixed struck dumb staring back into them with dilating pupilsand sudden numbness of fear that cannot move. The two sparks of lightcame forward until they grew to circles of flame and all at once liftedthemselves up as if in angry surprise.Then for the first time thrilled in Mr. Bernard's ears the dreadfulsound that nothing which breathes can hear unmoved--the long singingwhir as the huge thick-bodied reptile shook his many-jointed rattle.He waited as in a trance and while he looked straight into the flamingeyes it seemed to him that they were losing their light and terrorthat they were growing tame and dull. The charm was dissolving thenumbness passing away he could move once more. He heard a lightbreathing close to his ear and half turning saw the face of ElsieVenner looking motionless into the reptile's eyes which had shrunk andfaded under the stronger enchantment of her own.From that time Mr. Bernard was brought into new relations with Elsie. Hewas grateful she had led him out of danger and perhaps saved him fromdeath but he shuddered at the recollection of the whole scene. He madeup his mind that come what might he would solve the mystery of ElsieVenner sooner or later._II.--Cousin Richard Venner_Richard Venner had passed several of his early years with his uncleDudley Venner at the Dudley mansion the playmate of Elsie being hercousin two or three years older than herself. His mother was a lady ofBuenos Ayres of Spanish descent and had died while he was in hiscradle. A self-willed capricious boy he was a rough playmate forElsie.But Elsie was the wilder of these two motherless children. Old Sophy--said to be the granddaughter of a cannibal chief--who watched them intheir play and their quarrels always seemed to be more afraid for theboy than the girl."Massa Dick don' you be too rough wi' dat girl She scratch you las'week 'n' some day she bite you 'n' if she bite you Massa Dick----"Old Sophy nodded her head ominously as if she could say a great dealmore.Elsie's father whose fault was to indulge her in everything found thatit would never do to let these children grow up together. A sharperquarrel than usual decided this point. Master Dick forgot old Sophy'scaution and vexed the girl into a paroxysm of wrath in which shesprang at him and bit his arm. Old Dr. Kettredge was sent for and cameat once when he heard what had happened.He had a good deal to say about the danger there was from the teeth ofanimals or of human beings when enraged and he emphasised his remarks
comment818,by the application of a pencil of lunar caustic to each of the marksleft by the sharp white teeth.After this Master Dick went off on his travels which led him intostrange places and stranger company and so the boy grew up to youth andearly manhood.There came a time when the young gentleman thought he would like to seehis cousin again and wrote inviting himself to the Dudley mansion.Doctor Kettredge could see no harm in the visit when Dudley Vennerconsulted him. Her father was never easy about Elsie. He could not tellthe old doctor _all_ he knew. In God's good time he believed his onlydaughter would come to her true nature her eyes would lose thatfrightful cold glitter and that faint birth-mark which encircled herneck--her mother swooned when she first saw it--would fade wholly out."Let her go to the girls' school by all means" the doctor had saidwhen that was first talked about. "Anything to interest her. Friendshiplove religion--whatever will set her nature to work."When Dudley Venner mentioned his nephew's arrival the doctor only said"Let him stay a while it gives her something to think about." Hethought there was no danger of any sudden passion springing up betweentwo such young persons.So Mr. Richard came and the longer he stayed the more favourably theidea of a permanent residence in the mansion-house seemed to impresshim. The estate was large and of great value and there could not be adoubt that the property had largely increased. It was evident there wasan abundant income and Cousin Elsie was worth trying for. On the otherhand what was the matter with her eyes that they sucked your life outof you in that strange way And what did she always wear a necklace forBesides her father might last for ever or take it into his head tomarry again.He prolonged his visit until his presence became something like a matterof habit. In the meantime he found that Elsie was getting more constantin her attendance at school and learned on inquiry that there was anew master a handsome young man. The handsome young man would not haveliked the look that came over Dick Venner's face when he heard this factmentioned.For Mr. Richard had decided that he must have the property that thiswas his one great chance in life. The girl might not suit him as a wife.Possibly. Time enough to find out after he had got her. That Elsie nowregarded him with indifference if not aversion he could not concealfrom himself. The young man at the school was probably at the bottom ofit. "Cousin Elsie in love with a Yankee schoolmaster"But for a long time Dick Venner could get no positive evidence of anysentiment between Elsie and the schoolmaster. At one time he would bedevoured by suspicion at another he would laugh himself out of them.His jealousy at last broke out when he and Elsie were alone in aquestioning reference to Mr. Langdon.Elsie coloured and then answered abruptly and scornfully "Mr. Langdonis a gentleman and would not vex me as you do.""A gentleman" Dick answered with the most insulting accent. "Agentleman Come Elsie you've got the Dudley blood in your veins andit doesn't do for you to call this poor sneaking schoolmaster a
comment819,gentleman"He stopped short. Elsie's bosom was heaving the faint flush of hercheek was becoming a vivid glow. There was no longer any doubt in hismind. Elsie Venner loved Bernard Langdon. The sudden convictionabsolute overwhelming rushed upon him.Elsie made no answer but glided out of the room and slid away to herown apartment. She bolted the door and drew her curtains close. Thenshe threw herself on the floor and fell into a dull slow ache ofpassion without tears almost without words.Dick realised that he had reached a fearful point. He could not give upthe great Dudley property. Therefore the school-master must be got ridof and by self-destruction.Mr. Bernard Langdon must be found suspended to the branch of a treesomewhat within a mile of the Apollinean Institute._III.--The Perilous Hour_Old Doctor Kettredge had advised Bernard Langdon to go in for pistol-shooting and had even presented him with a small beautifully finishedrevolver. "I want you to carry this" he said "and more than that Iwant you to practise with it often so that it may be seen andunderstood that you are apt to have a pistol about you."This was at the conclusion of a conversation between the doctor and Mr.Bernard concerning Elsie Venner."Elsie interests me" said the young man "interests me strangely. Iwould risk my life for her but I do not love her. If her hand touchesmine it is not a thrill of passion I feel running through me but avery different emotion.""Mr. Langdon" said the doctor "you have come to this country townwithout suspicion and you are moving in the midst of perils. Keep youreyes open and your heart shut. If through pitying that girl you evercome to love her you are lost. If you deal carelessly with her bewareThis is not all. There are other eyes on you beside Elsie Venner's. Goarmed in future."Mr. Bernard thought the advice very odd but he followed it and soonbecame known as an expert at revolver-shooting. On the day when DickVenner had decided that the schoolmaster must be found hanged BernardLangdon went out as usual for the evening walk. He thrust his pistolwhich he had put away loaded into his pocket before starting.The moon was shining at intervals for the night was partially clouded.There seemed to be nobody stirring but presently he detected the soundof hoofs and looking forward saw a horseman coming in his direction.When the horseman was within a hundred and fifty yards of him the moonshone out suddenly and revealed each of them to the other. The riderpaused for a moment then suddenly put his horse to the full gallop anddashed towards him rising at the same instant in his stirrups andswinging something round his head. It was a strange manoeuvre sostrange and threatening that the young man cocked his pistol and waitedto see what mischief all this meant. He did not wait long. As the ridercame rushing towards him he made a rapid motion and something leapedfive-and-twenty feet through the air in Mr. Bernard's direction. In aninstant he felt a ring as of a rope or thong settle upon hisshoulders. There was no time to think he would be lost in anothersecond. He raised his pistol and fired--not at the rider but at thehorse. His aim was true the horse gave one bound and fell lifelessshot through the head. The lasso was fastened to his saddle and hislast bound threw Mr. Bernard violently to the earth where he laymotionless as if stunned.In the meantime Dick Venner who had been dashed down with his horse
comment820,was trying to extricate himself one of his legs was held fast under theanimal the long spur on his boot having caught in the saddle-cloth. Hefound however that he could do nothing with his right arm hisshoulder having been in some way injured in his fall. But his Southernblood was up and as he saw Mr. Bernard move as if he were coming tohis senses he struggled violently to free himself."I'll have the dog yet" he said "only let me get at him with theknife"He had just succeeded in extricating his imprisoned leg and was readyto spring to his feet when he was caught firmly by the throat andlooking up saw a hayfork within an inch of his breast."Hold on there What'n thunder 'r' y' abaout y' darned Portagee" saida sharp resolute voice.Dick looked from the weapon to the person who held it and saw AbelStebbins the doctor's man standing over him."Let me up Let me up" he cried in a low hurried voice. "I'll give youa hundred dollars in gold to let me go. The man a'n't hurt--don't yousee him stirring He'll come to himself in two minutes. Let me up I'llgive you a hundred and fifty dollars in gold now here on the spot andthe watch out of my pocket take it yourself with your own hands""Ketch me lett'n go" was Abel's emphatic answer.Mr. Bernard was now getting first his senses and then some few of hisscattered wits together."Who's hurt What's happened" he asked staring about him.Then he felt something about his neck and putting his hands up foundthe loop of the lasso. Abel quickly slipped the noose over Mr. Bernard'shead and put it round the neck of the miserable Dick Venner who withhis disabled arm felt resistance was hopeless.The party now took up the line of march for old Dr. Kettredge's houseAbel carrying Langdon's pistol and leading Dick Venner Bernard Langdonholding the hayfork. He was still half-stunned and felt it was all adream when they reached the house."My mind is confused" he told the doctor. "I've had a fall.""Sit down sit down" the doctor said. "Abel will tell me about it.Slight concussion of the brain. Can't remember very well for an hour ortwo--will come right by to-morrow"Dick Venner's shoulder was out of joint the doctor found he replacedit in a very few minutes. That night the doctor drove Dick forty milesat a stretch out of the limits of the state.He had implored them to let him go and Mr. Bernard was quite willingthat no further proceedings should be taken._IV.--The Secret is Whispered_A week after Dick Venner's departure Elsie went off at the accustomedhour to the school. She had none of the hard wicked light in her eyesthat morning and looked gentle but dreamy.At the end of the school hours when the girls had all gone out Elsiecame up to Mr. Bernard and said in a very low voice "Will you walktowards my home with me to-day"So they walked along together on their way towards the Dudley mansion."I have no friend" Elsie said all at once. "Nobody loves me but one oldwoman--old Sophy""I am your friend Elsie. Tell me what I can do to render your lifehappier."_"Love me"_ said Elsie Venner.Mr. Bernard turned pale."Elsie" he said presently "I do love you as a sister with sorrows ofher own--as one whom I would save at the risk of my happiness and life.Give me your hand dear Elsie and trust me that I will be as true afriend to you as if we were children of the same mother"Elsie gave him her hand mechanically and he pressed it gently. Theywalked almost in silence the rest of the way.It was all over with poor Elsie. She went at once to her own room whenthey reached the mansion-house and never left it.They sent for the old doctor and he ordered some remedies saying hewould call the next day hoping to find her better. But the next daycame and the next and still Elsie was on her bed--feverish restlessand silent."Send me Helen Darley" she said at last on the fourth day.And Helen came. Dudley Venner followed her into the room."She is your patient" he said "except while the doctor is here."Helen Darley often tried in those days and nights when she sat byElsie's bed to enter into the sick girl's confidence and affections
comment821,but there was always something that seemed inexplicable in the changesof mood. So Helen determined to ask old Sophy some questions."How old is Elsie""Eighteen years this las' September.""How long ago did her mother die""Eighteen year ago this October."Helen was silent for a moment. Then she whispered"What did her mother die of Sophy"The old woman caught Helen by the hand and clung to it as if in fear."Don't never speak in this house 'bout what Elsie's mother died of" shesaid. "God has made Ugly Things wi' death in their mouths Miss Darlin'an' He knows what they're for. But my poor Elsie To have her bloodchanged in her before--It was in July mistress got her death but sheliv' till three week after my poor Elsie was born."She could speak no more she had said enough. Helen remembered thestories she had heard on coming to the village. Now she knew the secretof the fascination which looked out of the cold glittering eyes.A great change came over Elsie in the last few days. It seemed to herfather as if the malign influence which had pervaded her being had beendriven forth or exorcised."It's her mother's look" said old Sophy. "It's her mother's own faceright over again. She never look' so before--the Lord's hand is on herHis will be done"But Elsie's heart was beating more feebly every day. One night withsudden effort she threw her arms round her father's neck kissed himand said "Good-night my dear father"Then her head fell back upon her pillow and a long sigh breathedthrough her lips.Elsie Venner was dead                                   In the following summer Mr. Dudley Venner married Miss Helen Darley. Mr.Bernard Langdon returned to college resumed his medical studies tookhis degree as Doctor of Medicine and he now also is married.                                   THOMAS HUGHESTom Brown's Schooldays     "Tom Brown's Schooldays" has been called by more than one     critic the best story of schoolboy life ever written and     three generations of readers have endorsed the opinion. Its     author Thomas Hughes born at Uffington Berkshire England     Oct. 19 1822 was himself like his hero both a Rugby boy     under Dr. Arnold and the son of a Berkshire squire but he     denied that the story was in any real sense autobiographical.     Matthew Arnold and Arthur H. Clough the poet were Hughes's     friends at school and in later life he became associated with     Charles Kingsley and Frederick Denison Maurice on what was     called the Christian Socialist movement. A barrister by     profession Thomas Hughes became a county court judge and     lived for many years in that capacity at Chester. Besides "Tom     Brown's Schooldays" published in 1857 Hughes also wrote "Tom     Brown at Oxford" 1861 biographies of Livingstone Bishop     Fraser and Daniel Macmillan and a number of political     religious and social pamphlets. He died on March 22 1896._I.--Tom Goes to Rugby_Squire Brown J.P. for the county of Berks dealt out justice and mercyin a thorough way and begat sons and daughters and hunted the fox andgrumbled at the badness of the roads and the times. And his wife dealtout stockings and shirts and smock frocks and comforting drinks to theold folks with the "rheumatiz" and good counsel to all.Tom was their eldest child a hearty strong boy from the first givento fighting with and escaping from his nurse and fraternising with all
comment822,the village boys with whom he made expeditions all round theneighbourhood.Squire Brown was a Tory to the backbone but nevertheless held diverssocial principles not generally supposed to be true blue in colour theforemost of which was the belief that a man is to be valued wholly andsolely for that which he is himself apart from all externals whatever.Therefore he held it didn't matter a straw whether his son associatedwith lords' sons or ploughmen's sons provided they were brave andhonest. So he encouraged Tom in his intimacy with the village boys andgave them the run of a close for a playground. Great was the grief amongthem when Tom drove off with the squire one morning to meet the coachon his way to Rugby to school.It had been resolved that Tom should travel down by the Tally-ho whichpassed through Rugby itself and as it was an early coach they droveout to the Peacock Inn at Islington to be on the road. Towards nineo'clock the squire observing that Tom was getting sleepy sent thelittle fellow off to bed with a few parting words the result of muchthought."And now Tom my boy" said the squire "remember you are going atyour own earnest request to be chucked into this great school like ayoung bear with all your troubles before you--earlier than we shouldhave sent you perhaps. You'll see a great many cruel blackguard thingsdone and hear a deal of foul bad talk. But never fear. You tell thetruth and keep a brave kind heart and never listen to or say anythingyou wouldn't have your mother or sister hear and you'll never feelashamed to come home or we to see you."The mention of his mother made Tom feel rather choky and he would haveliked to hug his father well if it hadn't been for his recentstipulation that kissing should now cease between them so he onlysqueezed his father's hand and looked up bravely and said "I'll tryfather"At ten minutes to three Tom was in the coffee-room in his stockings andthere was his father nursing a bright fire and a cup of coffee and ahard biscuit on the table.Just as he was swallowing the last mouthful Boots looks in and says"Tally-ho sir" And they hear the ring and rattle as it dashes up tothe Peacock."Good-bye father my love at home" A last shake of the hand. Up goesTom the guard holding on with one hand while he claps the horn to hismouth. Toot toot toot Away goes the Tally-ho into the darkness.Tom stands up and looks back at his father's figure as long as you cansee it and then comes to an anchor and finishes his buttonings andother preparations for facing the cold three hours before dawn. The
comment823,guard muffles Tom's feet up in straw and puts an oat-sack over hisknees but it is not until after breakfast that his tongue is unloosedand he rubs up his memory and launches out into a graphic history ofall the performances of the Rugby boys on the roads for the last twentyyears."And so here's Rugby sir at last and you'll be in plenty of time fordinner at the schoolhouse as I tell'd you" says the old guard.Tom's heart beat quick and he began to feel proud of being a Rugby boywhen he passed the school gates and saw the boys standing there as ifthe town belonged to them.One of the young heroes ran out from the rest and scrambled up behindwhere having righted himself with "How do Jem" to the guard heturned round short to Tom and began "I say you fellow is your nameBrown""Yes" said Tom in considerable astonishment."Ah I thought so my old aunt Miss East lives somewhere down your wayin Berkshire she wrote that you were coming to-day and asked me to giveyou a lift"Tom was somewhat inclined to resent the patronising air of his newfriend a boy of just about his own age and height but gifted with themost transcendent coolness and assurance which Tom felt to beaggravating and hard to bear but couldn't help admiring and envyingespecially when my young lord begins hectoring two or three long loafingfellows and arranges with one of them to carry up Tom's luggage."You see" said East as they strolled up to the school gates "a gooddeal depends on how a fellow cuts up at first. You see I'm doing thehandsome thing by you because my father knows yours besides I want toplease the old lady--she gave me half-a-sov. this half and perhaps'lldouble it next if I keep in her good books."Tom was duly placed in the Third Form and found his work very easy andas he had no intimate companion to make him idle East being in theLower Fourth soon gained golden opinions from his master and all wentwell with him in the school. As a new boy he was of course excusedfagging but in his enthusiasm this hardly pleased him and East andothers of his young friends kindly allowed him to indulge his fancy andtake their turns at night fagging and cleaning studies. So he soongained the character of a good-natured willing fellow ready to do aturn for anyone._II.--The War of Independence_The Lower Fourth was an overgrown Form too large for any one man toattend to properly consequently the elysium of the young scamps whoformed the staple of it. Tom had come up from the Third with a goodcharacter but he rapidly fell away and became as unmanageable as therest. By the time the second monthly examination came round hischaracter for steadiness was gone and for years after he went up theschool without it and regarded the masters as a matter of course ashis natural enemies. Matters were not so comfortable in the houseeither. The new praeposters of the Sixth Form were not strong and thebig Fifth Form boys soon began to usurp power and to fag and bully thelittle boys.One evening Tom and East were sitting in their study Tom brooding overthe wrongs of fags in general and his own in particular."I say Scud" said he at last "what right have the Fifth Form boys tofag us as they do""No more right than you have to fag them" said East without looking upfrom an early number of "Pickwick." Tom relapsed into his brown studyand East went on reading and chuckling."Do you know old fellow I've been thinking it over and I've made upmy mind I won't fag except for the Sixth.""Quite right too my boy" cried East. "I'm all for a strike myself
comment824,it's getting too bad.""I shouldn't mind if it were only young Brooke now" said Tom "I'd doanything for him. But that blackguard Flashman----""The cowardly brute" broke in East."Fa-a-ag" sounded along the passage from Flashman's study.The two boys looked at one another."Fa-a-ag" again. No answer."Here Brown East You young skulks" roared Flashman. "I know you'rein No shirking"Tom bolted the door and East blew out the candle."Now Tom no surrender"Then the assault commenced. One panel of the door gave way to repeatedkicks and the besieged strengthened their defences with the sofa.Flashman  Co. at last retired vowing vengeance and when the convivialnoises began again steadily Tom and East rushed out. They were tooquick to be caught but a pickle-jar sent whizzing after them byFlashman narrowly missed Tom's head. Their story was soon told to a knotof small boys round the fire in the hall who nearly all boundthemselves not to fag for the Fifth encouraged and advised thereto byDiggs--a queer very clever fellow nearly at the top of the Fifthhimself. He stood by them all through and seldom have small boys hadmore need of a friend.Flashman and his associates united in "bringing the young vagabonds totheir senses" and the whole house was filled with chasings sieges andlickings of all sorts.One evening in forbidden hours Brown and East were in the hallchatting by the light of the fire when the door swung open and inwalked Flashman. He didn't see Diggs busy in front of the other fireand as the boys didn't move for him struck one of them and orderedthem all off to their study."I say you two" said Diggs rousing up "you'll never get rid of thatfellow till you lick him. Go in at him both of you I'll see fairplay."They were about up to Flashman's shoulder but tough and in perfecttraining while he seventeen years old and big and strong of his agewas in poor condition from his monstrous habits of stuffing and want ofexercise.They rushed in on him and he hit out wildly and savagely and inanother minute Tom went spinning backwards over a form and Flashmanturned to demolish East with a savage grin. But Diggs jumped down fromthe table on which he had seated himself."Stop there" shouted he. "The round's over Half minute time allowedI'm going to see fair. Are you ready Brown Time's up"The small boys rushed in again Flashman was wilder and more flurriedthan ever. In a few moments over all three went on the floor Flashmanstriking his head on a form. But his skull was not fractured as the twoyoungsters feared it was and he never laid a finger on them again. Butwhatever harm a spiteful tongue could do them he took care should bedone. Only throw dirt enough and some will stick. And so Tom and Eastand one or two more became a sort of young Ishmaelites. They saw thepraeposters cowed by or joining with the Fifth and shirking their ownduties and so they didn't respect them and rendered no willingobedience and got the character of sulky unwilling fags. At the end ofthe term they are told the doctor wants to see them. He is not angryonly very grave. He explains that rules are made for the good of theschool and must and shall be obeyed He should be sorry if they had toleave and wishes them to think very seriously in the holidays over whathe has said. Good-night_III.--The Turn of the Tide_The turning point of our hero's school career had now come and themanner of it was as follows.Tom and East and another Schoolhouse boy rushed into the matron's roomin high spirits when they got back on the first day of the nexthalf-year. She sent off the others but kept Tom to tell him Mrs. Arnoldwished him to take a new boy to share the study he had hoped to sharewith East. She had told Mrs. Arnold she thought Tom would be kind to
comment825,him and see that he wasn't bullied.In the far corner of the room he saw a slight pale boy who lookedready to sink through the floor. The matron watched Tom for a minuteand saw what was passing in his mind."Poor little fellow" she said almost in a whisper. "His father's deadand his mamma--such a sweet kind lady--almost broke her heart atleaving him. She said one of his sisters was like to die of a decline----""Well well" burst in Tom "I suppose I must give up East. Come alongyoung 'un What's your name We'll go and have supper and then I'llshow you our study.""His name's George Arthur" said the matron. "I've had his books andthings put into the study which his mamma has had new papered and thesofa covered and new curtains. And Mrs. Arnold told me to say she'dlike you both to come up to tea with her."Here was an announcement for Master Tom He was to go up to tea thefirst night just as if he were of importance in the school worldinstead of the most reckless young scapegrace among the fags. He felthimself lifted on to a higher moral platform at once and marched offwith his young charge in tow in monstrous good humour with himself andall the world. His cup was full when Dr. Arnold with a warm shake ofthe hand seemingly oblivious of all the scrapes he had been gettinginto said "Ah Brown you here I hope you left all well at home. Andthis is the little fellow who is to share your study Well he doesn'tlook as we should like to see him. You must take him some good longwalks and show him what little pretty country we have about here."The tea went merrily off and everybody felt that he young as he waswas of some use in the school world and had a work to do there. WhenTom was recognised coming out of the private door which led from thedoctor's house there was a great shout of greeting and Hall at oncebegan to question Arthur."What a queer chum for Tom Brown" was the general comment. And it mustbe confessed that so thought Tom himself as he lighted the candle intheir study and surveyed the new curtains with much satisfaction."I say Arthur what a brick your mother is to make us so cosy But lookhere now you must answer straight up when the fellows speak to you. Ifyou're afraid you'll get bullied. And don't you ever talk about home oryour mother or sisters."Poor little Arthur looked ready to cry."But please mayn't I talk about home to you""Oh yes I like it. But not to boys you don't know. What a jolly desk"And soon Tom was deep in Arthur's goods and chattels and hardly thoughtof his friends outside till the prayer-bell rang.He thought of his own first night there when he was leading poor littleArthur up to No. 4 and showing him his bed. The idea of sleeping in aroom with strange boys had clearly never crossed his mind before. Hecould hardly bare to take his jacket off. However presently off itcame and he paused and looked at Tom who was sitting on his bedtalking and laughing."Please Brown" he whispered "may I wash my face and hands""Of course if you like" said Tom staring. "You'll have to go down formore water if you use it all." On went the talk and laughter. Arthurfinished his undressing and looked round more nervously than ever. Thelight burned clear the noise went on. This time however he did notask Tom what he might or might not do but dropped on his knees by hisbedside to open his heart to Him who heareth the cry of the tenderchild or the strong man.Tom was unlacing his boots with his back towards Arthur and looked upin wonder at the sudden silence. Then two or three boys laughed and onebig brutal fellow picked up a slipper and shied it at the kneeling boy.The next moment the boot Tom had just taken off flew straight at thehead of the bully."If any other fellow wants the other boot" said Tom stepping on to thefloor "he knows how to get it"At this moment the Sixth Form boy came in and not another word could besaid. Tom and the rest rushed into bed and finished unrobing there.
comment826,Sleep seemed to have deserted the pillow of poor Tom. The thought of hispromise to his mother came over him never to forget to kneel at hisbedside and give himself up to his Father before he laid his head on thepillow from which it might never rise and he lay down gently and criedas if his heart would break. He was only fourteen years old.Next morning he was up and washed and dressed just as the ten-minutesbell began and then in the face of the whole room knelt down to pray.Not five words could he say he was listening for every whisper in theroom. What were they all thinking of him At last as it were from hisinmost heart a still small voice seemed to breathe "God be mercifulto me a sinner." He repeated the words over and over again and rosefrom his knees comforted and humbled and ready to face the wholeschool. It was not needed two other boys had already followed hisexample. Before either Tom or Arthur left the Schoolhouse there was noroom in which it had not become the regular custom._IV.--Tom Brown's Last Match_The curtain now rises on the last act of our little drama. Eight yearshave passed and it is the end of the summer half-year at Rugby. Theboys have scattered to the four winds except the Eleven and a fewenthusiasts who are permitted to stay to see the result of the cricketmatches. For this year the return matches are being played at Rugby andto-day the great event of the year the Marylebone match is beingplayed. I wish I had space to describe the whole match but I haven'tso you must fancy it all and let me beg to call your attention to agroup of three eagerly watching the match. The first evidently aclergyman is carelessly dressed and looks rather used up but is benton enjoying life as he spreads himself out in the evening sun. By hisside in white flannel shirt and trousers and the captain's belt sitsa strapping figure near six feet high with ruddy tanned face and alaughing eye. He is leaning forward dandling his favourite bat withwhich he has made thirty or forty runs to-day. It is Tom Brown spendinghis last day as a Rugby boy. And at their feet sits Arthur with his batacross his knees. He is less of a boy in fact than Tom if one mayjudge by the thoughtfulness of his face which is somewhat paler than wecould wish but his figure is well-knit and active and all his oldtimidity has disappeared and is replaced by silent quaint fun as helistens to the broken talk and joins in every now and then. Presentlyhe goes off to the wicket with a last exhortation from Tom to playsteady and keep his bat straight."I'm surprised to see Arthur in the Eleven" says the master."Well I'm not sure he ought to be for his play" said Tom "but Icouldn't help putting him in. It will do him so much good and you can'tthink what I owe him"The master smiled. Later he returned to the subject"Nothing has given me greater pleasure" he said "than your friendshipfor him. It has been the making of you both.""Of me at any rate" answered Tom. "It was the luckiest chance in theworld that sent him to Rugby and made him my chum.""There was neither luck nor chance in that matter" said the master. "Doyou remember when the Doctor lectured you and East when you had beengetting into all sorts of scrapes""Yes well enough" said Tom. "It was the half-year before Arthur came.""Exactly so" said the master. "He was in great distress about you bothand after some talk we both agreed that you in particular wanted someobject in the school beyond games and mischief. So the Doctor looked outthe best of the new boys and separated you and East in the hope thatwhen you had somebody to lean on you you'd be steadier yourself andget manliness and thoughtfulness. He has watched the experiment eversince with great satisfaction."Up to this time Tom had never fully given in to or understood theDoctor. He had learnt to regard him with love and respect and to thinkhim a very great and wise and good man. But as regarded his own positionin the school he had no idea of giving anyone credit but himself.It was a new light to Tom to find that besides teaching the Sixth and
comment827,governing and guiding the whole school editing classics and writinghistories the great headmaster had found time to watch over the careereven of him Tom Brown and his particular friends. However theDoctor's victory was complete from that moment. It had taken eight longyears to do it but now it was done thoroughly.The match was over.Tom said good-bye to his tutor and marched down to the Schoolhouse.Next morning he was in the train and away for London no longer aschoolboy.                                   Tom Brown at Oxford     "Tom Brown at Oxford" a continuation of "Tom Brown's     Schooldays" was published in 1861 but like most sequels it     failed to achieve the wide popularity of its famous     predecessor. Although the story perhaps lacks much of the     freshness of the "Schooldays" it nevertheless conveys an     admirable picture of undergraduate life as it was in the     middle of the nineteenth century. Notwithstanding the changes     that have taken place since then it is still remarkably full     of vitality and the description of the boat races and the     bumping of Exeter and Oriel by St. Ambrose's boat might well     have been written to-day. In spite of its defects the story     with its vigorous morals is worthy to rank with anything that     came from the pen of Tom Hughes the great apostle of muscular     Christianity._I.--St. Ambrose's College_In the Michaelmas term after leaving school Tom went up to matriculateat St. Ambrose's College Oxford but did not go up to reside till thefollowing January.St. Ambrose's College was a moderate-sized one. There were some seventyor eighty undergraduates in residence when our hero appeared there as afreshman of whom a large proportion were gentleman-commoners enoughin fact to give the tone to the college which was decidedly fast.Fewer and fewer of the St. Ambrose men appeared in the class-lists oramong the prize men. They no longer led the debates in the Union theboat lost place after place on the river the eleven got beaten in allthe matches. But now a reaction had begun. The fellows recently electedwere men of great attainments chosen as the most likely persons torestore as tutors the golden days of the college.Our hero on leaving school had bound himself solemnly to write all hisdoings to the friend he had left behind him and extracts from his firstletter from college will give a better idea of the place than anyaccount by a third party."Well first and foremost it's an awfully idle place--at any rate forus freshmen. Fancy now I am in twelve lectures a week of an hour each.There's a treat Two hours a day and no extra work at all. Of course I
comment828,never look at a lecture before I go in I know it all nearly by heartand for the present the light work suits me for there's plenty to seein this place. We keep very gentlemanly hours. Chapel every morning ateight and evening at seven. You must attend once a day and twice onSundays and be in gates at twelve o'clock. And you ought to dine inhall perhaps four days a week. All the rest of your time you do justwhat you like with."My rooms are right up in the roof with a commanding view of tiles andchimney-pots. Pleasant enough separated from all mankind by a greatiron-clamped outer door sitting-room eighteen by twelve bedroomtwelve by eight and a little cupboard for the scout. Ah Geordie thescout is an institution Fancy me waited on and valeted by a stout partyin black of quiet gentlemanly planners. He takes the deepest interestin my possessions and proceedings and is evidently used to goodsociety to judge by the amount of crockery and glass wines liquorsand grocery which he thinks indispensable for my due establishment. Hewaits on me in hall where we go in full fig of cap and gown at fiveand get very good dinners and cheap enough."But after all the river is the feature of Oxford to my mind. Iexpect I shall take to boating furiously. I have been down the riverthree or four times already with some other freshmen and it is gloriousexercise that I can see though we bungle and cut crabs desperately atpresent."Within a day or two of the penning of this epistle Tom realised one ofthe objects of his young Oxford ambition and succeeded in embarking ina skiff by himself. He had been such a proficient in all the Rugby gamesthat he started off in the full confidence that if he could only have aturn or two alone he should satisfy not only himself but everybody elsethat he was a heaven-born oar. But the truth soon began to dawn upon himthat pulling especially sculling does not like reading and writingcome by nature. However he addressed himself manfully to his tasksavage indeed but resolved to get down to Sandford and back beforehall-time or perish in the attempt. Fortunately the prudent boatmanhad embarked our hero in one of the safest of the tubs and it was notuntil he had zig-zagged down Kennington reach slowly indeed and withmuch labour that he heard energetic shouts behind him. The next minutethe bows of his boat whirled round the old tub grounded and thenturning over shot him out on to the planking of the steep descent intothe small lasher. The rush of water was too strong for him and rollinghim over plunged him into the pool below.After the first moment of astonishment and fright Tom left himself tothe stream holding his breath hard and paddling gently with hishands soon came to the surface and was about to strike out for theshore when he caught sight of a skiff coming stern foremost down thedescent after him. Down she came as straight as an arrow into thetumult below the sculler sitting upright and holding his skullssteadily in the water. For a moment she seemed to be going under butrighted herself and glided swiftly into the still water while thesculler glanced round till he caught sight of our hero's half-drownedhead."Oh there you are" he said looking much relieved "Swim ashore I'lllook after your boat."So Tom swam ashore and stood there dripping and watching the otherrighting his tub and collecting the sculls and bottom-boards floatinghere and there in the pool. Tom had time to look him well over and waswell satisfied with the inspection. There was that in his face that hitTom's fancy and made him anxious to know him better. There wereprobably not three men in the university who would have dared to shootthe lasher in the state it was then.It was settled at Tom's earnest request that he should pull the soundskiff up--his old tub was leaking considerably--while his companion satin the stern and coached him. Tom poured out his thanks for his newtutor's instructions which were given so judiciously that he wasconscious of improving at every stroke.
comment829,He disappeared however while Tom was wrangling with the manager as tothe amount of damage done to the tub and when Tom to his joy saw himcome into hall to dinner he took no notice of Tom's looks ofrecognition. He learned from his neighbour that his name was Hardy thathe was one of the servitors a clever fellow but a very queer one. Tomresolved to waylay him as soon as hall was over but Hardy avoided him._II.--Summer Term_Jervis the captain of the St. Ambrose Boat Club Miller the cox andSmith commonly known as Diogenes Smith--from a habit he had of usinghis hip-bath as an armchair--were determined to make a success of theboat and Tom had the good fortune to get a place in the collegeeight--an achievement which is always a feather in the cap of afreshman.When the summer term came Miller at once took the crew in hand.Then came the first night of the races and at half-past three Tom wasrestless and distracted knowing that two hours and a half had got topass before it was time to start for the boats.However at last the time slipped away and the captain and Millermustered their crew at the college gates and walked off to the river.Half the undergraduates of Oxford streamed along with them. No time waslost on arrival at the barge in the dressing-room and in two minutesthe St. Ambrose eight were all standing in flannel trousers silkjerseys and jackets at the landing-place.Then the boat swung steadily down past the mouth of the Cherwell andthrough the Gut to the starting-place. Hark The first gunAll the boats have turned crowds of men on the bank are agitated withthe coming excitement.Jervis quiet and full of confidence looks round from his seat--he isstroking--takes a sliced lemon from his pocket puts a small piece intohis mouth and passes it on."Jackets off" says Miller. And the jackets are thrown on shore andgathered up by the boatman."Eight seconds more only" Miller calls out. "Look out for the flashRemember all eyes in the boat"There it comes at last the flash of the starting gun. The boat breaksaway with a bound and a dash. The oars flash in the water and the boatleaps forward.For the first ten strokes Tom was in too great fear of making a mistaketo feel or hear or see. But as the crew settled down into the well-knownlong sweep consciousness returned and amid all the babel of voices onthe bank he could hear Hardy yelling "Steady Well pulled Steady"And now the St. Ambrose boat is well away from the boat behind and asit nears the Gut it is plainly gaining on Exeter--the boat in front."You're gaining" Miller mutters and the captain responds with a wink.Shouts come from the bank. "Now St. Ambrose" "Now Exeter"In another moment both boats are in the Gut and Miller motionless as astatue till now calls out "Give it her boys Six strokes and we areinto them" Old Jervis lashes his oar through the water the boatanswers to the spurt and Tom feels a little shock and hears a gratingsound as Miller shouts "Unship oars bow and three." The nose of theSt. Ambrose boat glides quietly up the side of the Exeter the firstbump has been made.Two more bumps were made on the next two nights and bets were laidfreely that St. Ambrose would bump Oriel and become head of the river.But the Oriel crew were mostly old oars seasoned in many a race andone or two in the St. Ambrose boat were getting "stale."Something had to be done and when Drysdale--agentleman-commoner--resenting Miller's strictures on his performance atNo. 2 declined to row any more Tom suggested that Hardy would row ifhe were asked.Hardy shy and proud because of his poverty was little known in St.
comment830,Ambrose but a fast friendship had grown up between him and Tom Brownand he was glad enough to come into the boat at the captain's request.The change in the boat made all the difference. Hardy was out scullingevery day on the river and was consequently in good training. He wasbesides a man of long muscular arms.It was a great race. Inch by inch St. Ambrose gained on Oriel creepingup slowly but surely but the bump was not made till both boats wereclose on the winning-post. So near a shave was it As for the scene onthe bank it was a hurly-burly of delirious joy.St. Ambrose was head of the river_III.--A Crisis_There was a certain inn called the Choughs where the St. Ambrose menwere in the habit of calling for ale on their way back from the riverand it had become the correct thing for Ambrosians to make much of MissPatty the landlady's niece. Considering the circumstances it was awonder Patty was not more spoilt than was the case. As it was Hardy hadto admit that the girl held her own well without doing or sayinganything unbecoming a modest woman. But he was convinced that Tom was inher toils and after pondering what he ought to do decided to speakplainly.Tom had gone into Hardy's rooms according to his custom after hall andHardy at once opened fire concerning the Choughs."Brown you've no right to go to that place" he said abruptly."Why" said Tom."You know why" said Hardy."Why am I not to go to the Choughs Because there happens to be a prettybarmaid there All our crew go and twenty other men besides.""Yes but do any of them go in the sort of way you do Does she look atany one of them as she does at you""You seem to know a great deal about it" said Tom. "How should I know""That's not fair or true or like you Brown" said Hardy. "You do knowthat that girl doesn't care a straw for the other men who go there. Youdo know that she is beginning to care for you. I've taken it on myselfto speak to you about this and I shouldn't be your friend if I shirkedit. You shan't go on with this folly this sin for want of warning.""So it seems" said Tom doggedly. "Now I think I've had warning enough.Suppose we drop the subject""Not yet" said Hardy firmly. "There are only two endings to this sortof business and you know it as well as I.""A right and a wrong one--eh And because I'm your friend you assumethat my end will be the wrong one""I say the end _must_ be the wrong one here There's no right end. Thinkof your family. You dare not tell me that you will marry her""I _dare_ not tell you" said Tom starting up. "I dare tell any mananything I please""I say again" went on Hardy "you _dare_ not say you mean to marry herYou don't mean it And as you don't to kiss her in the passage as youdid tonight----""So you were sneaking behind to watch me" burst out Tom.Hardy only answered calmly and slowly "I will not take these words fromany man You had better leave my rooms"The next minute Tom was in the passage the next striding up and downthe side of the inner quadrangle in the peace of the pale moonlight.
comment831,The following day and for many days neither Hardy nor Tom spoke to oneanother. Both were wretched and both feared lest others should noticethe quarrel.Tom went more and more to the Choughs and Patty noticed a change in theyouth--a change that half-fascinated and half-repelled her.Then for the next few days Tom plunged deeper and deeper downwards. Heleft off pulling on the river shunned his old friends and lived with aset of men who were ready enough to let him share all their brutalorgies.Drysdale with whom Tom had been on good terms noted the differenceand advised him "to cut the Choughs business.""You're not the sort of a fellow to go in for this kind of thing" hesaid. "I'll be hanged if it won't kill you or make a devil of youbefore long Make up your mind to cut the whole concern old fellow""I'm awfully wretched Drysdale" was all Tom could say.All the same Tom could not follow Drysdale's advice at once and breakoff his visits to the Choughs altogether.The real crisis was over. He had managed to pass through the eye of thestorm and was drifting into the skirts of it conscious of an escapefrom utter shipwreck.His visits to the Choughs became shorter he never stayed behind nowafter the other men and avoided interviews with Patty alone asdiligently as he had sought them before.Patty unable to account for this fresh change of manner was piquedand ready to revenge herself in a hundred little ways. If she had beenreally in love with him it would have been a different matter but shewas not. In the last six weeks she certainly had often had visions ofthe pleasures of being a lady and keeping servants but her liking wasnot more than skin deep.Of late indeed she had been much more frightened than attracted by theconduct of her admirer and really felt it a relief notwithstanding herpique when he retired into a less demonstrative state.Before the end of that summer term Tom had it made up with Hardy and itwas Hardy who at Tom's request called in at the Choughs just to seehow things were going on. Tom saw at a glance that something hadhappened when Hardy appeared again."What is it She is not ill" he said quickly."No quite well her aunt says.""You didn't see her then""No the fact is she has gone home."_IV.--The Master's Term_The years speed by bringing their changes to St. Ambrose. Hardy is afellow and tutor of the college in Tom's second year and Drysdale hasbeen requested to remove his name from the books. Tom is all forpolitics now and the theories he propounds in the Union gain him thename of Chartist Brown.In his third year Hardy often brought him down from high talk of"universal democracy" and "the good cause" by insisting on making theyounger man explain what he really meant. And though Tom suffered underthis severe treatment in the end he generally came round to acknowledgethe reasonableness of Hardy's methods of argument.It was a trying year to Tom this third and last year full of largedreams and small performances of hopes and struggles ending in failureand disappointment. The common pursuits of the place had lost theirfreshness and with it much of their charm. He was beginning to feelhimself in a cage and to beat against the bars of it.Squire Brown was passing through Oxford and paid his son a visit in the
comment832,last term.Tom gave a small wine-party which went off admirably and the squireenlarged upon the great improvement in young men and habits of theuniversity especially in the matter of drinking. Tom had only openedthree bottles of port. In his time the men would have drunk certainlynot less than a bottle a man.But as the squire walked back to his hotel he was deeply moved at theRadical views his son now held. He could not understand these newnotions of young men and thought them mischievous and bad. At the sametime he was too fair a man to try to dragoon his son out of anythingwhich he really believed. The fact had begun to dawn on the squire thatthe world had changed a good deal since his time while Tom on hispart valued his father's confidence and love above his own opinions. Bydegrees the honest beliefs of father and son no longer looked monstrousto one another and the views of each of them were modified.                                   One more look must be taken at the old college. Our hero is up in thesummer term keeping his three weeks' residence the necessarypreliminary to an M.A. degree. We find him sitting in Hardy's rooms teais over scouts out of college candles lighted and silence reigningexcept when distant sounds of mirth come from some undergraduates' roomson the opposite side of the quad."Why can't you give a fellow his degree quietly" says Tom "withoutmaking him come and kick his heels here for three weeks""You ungrateful dog Do you mean to say you haven't enjoyed coming backand sitting in dignity in the bachelors' seats in chapel and at thebachelors' table in hall and thinking how much wiser you are than theundergraduates Besides your old friends want to see you and you oughtto want to see them.""Well I'm very glad to see you again old fellow. But who else is thereI care to see My old friends are gone and the youngsters look on me asa sort of don and I don't appreciate the dignity. You have never brokenwith the place. And then you always did your duty and have done thecollege credit. You can't enter into the feelings of a fellow who wastedthree parts of his time here.""Come come Tom You might have read more certainly and taken ahigher degree. But after all I believe your melancholy comes from yournot being asked to pull in the boat.""Perhaps it does. Don't you call it degrading to be pulling in thetorpid in one's old age""Mortified vanity It's a capital boat. I wonder how we should haveliked to have been turned out for some bachelor just because he hadpulled a good oar in his day""Not at all. I don't blame the youngsters. By the way they're anuncommonly nice set. Much better behaved in every way than we were. Whythe college is a different place altogether. And as you are the only newtutor it must have been your doing. Now I want to know your secret""I've no secret except taking a real interest in all that the men doand living with them as much as I can. You may guess it isn't much of atrial to me to steer the boat down or run on the bank and coach thecrew. And now the president of St. Ambrose himself comes out to see theboat. But I don't mean to stop up more than another year now at theoutside. I have been tutor nearly three years and that's about longenough."The talk went on until the clock struck twelve."Hallo" said Tom. "Time for me to knock out or the old porter will bein bed. Good-night""Good-night"                                   VICTOR HUGOLes Misrables     Victor Marie Hugo the great French poet dramatist and     novelist was born at Besanon on February 26 1802. He wrote     verses from boyhood and after minor successes achieved     reputation with "Odes et Posies" 1823. Hugo early became the     protagonist of the romantic movement in French literature. In     1841 he was elected to the Academy. From 1845 he took an     increasingly active part in politics with the result that     from 1852 to 1870 he lived in exile first in Jersey and then
comment833,     in Guernsey. "Les Misrables" is not only the greatest of all     Victor Hugo's productions but is in many respects the     greatest work of fiction ever conceived. An enormous range of     matter is pressed into its pages--by turn historical     philosophical lyrical humanitarian--but running through all     the change of scene is the tragedy and comedy of life at its     darkest and its brightest and of human passions at their     worst and at their best. It is more than a novel. It is a     magnificent plea for the outcasts of society for those who     are crushed by the mighty edifice of social order. Yet     throughout it all there is the insistent note of the final     triumph of goodness in the heart of man. The story appeared in     1862 when Hugo was sixty years old and was written during     his exile in Guernsey. It was translated before publication     into nine languages and published simultaneously in eight of     the principal cities of the world. Hugo died on May 22 1885.     See also Vol. XVII._I.--Jean Valjean Galley-Slave_Early in October 1815 at the close of the afternoon a man came intothe little town of D----. He was on foot and the few people aboutlooked at him suspiciously. The traveller was of wretched appearancethough stout and robust and in the full vigour of life. He wasevidently a stranger and tired dusty and wearied with a long day'stramp.But neither of the two inns in the town would give him food or shelterthough he offered good money for payment.He was an ex-convict--that was enough to exclude him.In despair he went to the prison and asked humbly for a night'slodging but the jailer told him that was impossible unless he gotarrested first.It was a cold night and the wind was blowing from the Alps it seemedthere was no refuge open to him.Then as he sat down on a stone bench in the marketplace and tried tosleep a lady coming out of the cathedral noticed him and learning hishomeless state bade him knock at the bishop's house for the goodbishop's charity and compassion were known in all the neighbourhood.At the man's knock the bishop who lived alone with his sister MadameMagloire and an old housekeeper said "Come in" and the ex-convictentered.He told them at once that his name was Jean Valjean that he was agalley-slave who had spent nineteen years at the hulks and that he hadbeen walking for four days since his release. "It is the same wherever Igo" the man went on. "They all say to me 'Be off' I am very tired andhungry. Will you let me stay here I will pay.""Madame Magloire" said the bishop "please lay another knife and fork.Sit down monsieur and warm yourself. We shall have supper directlyand your bed will be got ready while we are supping."Joy and amazement were on the man's face he stammered his thanks asthough beside himself.The bishop in honour of his guest had silver forks and spoons placedon the table.The man took his food with frightful voracity and paid no attention toanyone till the meal was over. Then the bishop showed him his bed in analcove and an hour later the whole household was asleep.Jean Valjean soon woke up again.For nineteen years he had been at the galleys. Originally a pruner oftrees he had broken a baker's window and stolen a loaf one hard winterwhen there was no work to be had and for this the sentence was fiveyears. Time after time he had tried to escape and had always beenrecaptured and for each offence a fresh sentence was imposed.Nineteen years for breaking a window and stealing a loaf He had goneinto prison sobbing and shuddering. He came out full of hatred andbitterness.That night at the bishop's house for the first time in nineteen yearsJean Valjean had received kindness. He was moved and shaken. It seemedinexplicable.He got up from his bed. Everyone was asleep the house was perfectlystill.Jean Valjean seized the silver plate-basket which stood in the bishop'sroom put the silver into his knapsack and fled out of the house.
comment834,In the morning while the bishop was breakfasting the gendarmes broughtin Jean Valjean. The sergeant explained that they had met him runningaway and had arrested him because of the silver they found on him."I gave you the candlesticks too" said the bishop "they are silver.Why did not you take them with the rest of the plate" Then turning tothe gendarmes "It is a mistake.""We are to let him go" said the sergeant."Certainly" said the bishop.The gendarmes retired."My friend" said the bishop to Jean Valjean "here are yourcandlesticks. Take them with you." He added in a low voice "Neverforget that you have promised me to use this silver to become an honestman. My brother you belong no longer to evil but to good."Jean Valjean never remembered having promised anything. He left thebishop's house and the town dazed and stupefied. It was a new world hehad come into.He walked on for miles and then sat down by the roadside to think.Presently a small Savoyard boy passed him and as he passed dropped atwo-franc piece on the ground.Jean Valjean placed his foot upon it. In vain the boy prayed him for thecoin. Jean Valjean sat motionless deep in thought.Only when the boy had gone on in despair did Jean Valjean wake fromhis reverie.He shouted out "Little Gervais little Gervais" for the boy had toldhim his name. The lad was out of sight and hearing and no answer came.The enormity of his crime came home to him and Jean Valjean fell on theground and for the first time in nineteen years he wept._II.--Father Madeleine_On a certain December night in 1815 a stranger entered the town ofM---- at the very time when a great fire had just broken out in thetown hall.This man at once rushed into the flames and at the risk of his own lifesaved the two children of the captain of gendarmes. In consequence ofthis act no one thought of asking for his passport.The stranger settled in the town by a happy invention he improved themanufacture of the black beads the chief industry of M---- and inthree years from a very small capital he became a rich man andbrought prosperity to the place.In 1820 Father Madeleine for so the stranger was called was madeMayor of M---- by unanimous request an honour he had declined theprevious year. Before he came everything was languishing in the townand now a few years later there was healthy life for all.Father Madeleine employed everybody who came to him. The only conditionhe made was--honesty. From the men he expected good-will from thewomen purity.Prosperity did not make Father Madeleine change his habits. He performedhis duties as mayor but lived a solitary and simple life avoidingsociety. His strength although he was a man of fifty was enormous. Itwas noticed that he read more as his leisure increased and that as theyears went by his speech became gentler and more polite.One person only in all the district looked doubtfully at the mayor andthat was Javert inspector of police.Javert born in prison was the incarnation of police duty--implacableresolute fanatical. He arrived in M---- when Father Madeleine wasalready a rich man and he felt sure he had seen him before.
comment835,One day in 1823 the mayor interfered to prevent Javert sending a poorwoman named Fantine to prison. Fantine had been dismissed from thefactory without the knowledge of M. Madeleine and her one hope in lifewas in her little girl whom she called Cosette. Now Cosette wasboarded out at the village of Montfermeil some leagues distance fromM---- with a family grasping and dishonest and to raise money forCosette's keep had brought Fantine to misery and sickness.The mayor could save Fantine from prison he could not save her lifebut before the unhappy woman died she had delivered a paper to Mr.Madeleine authorising him to take her child and Mr. Madeleine hadaccepted the trust.It was when Fantine lay dying in the hospital that Javert who had quitedecided in his own mind who M. Madeleine was came to the mayor andasked to be dismissed from the service."I have denounced you M. le Maire to the prefect of police at Paris asJean Valjean an ex-convict who has been wanted for the robbery of alittle Savoyard more than five years ago.""And what answer did you receive""That I was mad for the real Jean Valjean has been found.""Ah"Javert explained that an old man had been arrested for breaking into anorchard that on being taken to the prison he had been recognised byseveral people as Jean Valjean and that he Javert himself recognisedhim. To-morrow he was to be tried at Arras and as he was anex-convict his sentence would be for life.Terrible was the anguish of M. Madeleine that night. He had done allthat man could do to obliterate the past and now it seemed another wasto be taken in his place. The torture and torment ended. In the morningM. Madeleine set out for Arras.M. Madeleine arrived before the orchard-breaker was condemned. He provedto the court's astonishment that he the revered and philanthropic Mayorof M---- was Jean Valjean and that the prisoner had merely committed atrivial theft. Then he left the court returned to M---- removed whatmoney he had buried it and arranged his affairs.A few days later Jean Valjean was sent back to the galleys at Toulonand with his removal the prosperity of M---- speedily collapsed. Thiswas in July 1823. In November of that year the following paragraphappeared in the Toulon paper"Yesterday a convict on his return from rescuing a sailor fell intothe sea and was drowned. His body has not been found. His name wasregistered as Jean Valjean."_III.--A Hunted Man_At Christmas in the year 1823 an old man came to the village ofMontfermeil called at the inn paid money to the rascally innkeeperThnardier and carried off little Cosette to Paris.The old man rented a large garret in an old house and Cosette becameinexpressibly happy with her doll and with the good man who loved her sotenderly.Till then Jean Valjean had never loved anything. He had never been afather lover husband or friend. When he saw Cosette and had rescuedher he felt his heart strangely moved. All the affection he had wasaroused and went out to this child. Jean Valjean was fifty-five andCosette eight and all the love of his life hitherto untouched meltedinto a benevolent devotion.Cosette too changed. She had been separated from her mother at such anearly age that she could not remember her. And the Thnardiers hadtreated her harshly. In Jean Valjean she found a father just as hefound a daughter in Cosette.Weeks passed away. These two beings led a wonderfully happy life in theold garret Cosette would chatter laugh and sing all day.Jean Valjean was careful never to go out in the daytime but he began tobe known in the district as "the mendicant who gives away money." There
comment836,was one old man who sat by some church steps and who generally seemedto be praying whom Jean Valjean always liked to relieve. One night whenJean Valjean had dropped a piece of money into his hand as usual thebeggar suddenly raised his eyes stared hard at him and then quicklydropped his head. Jean Valjean started and went home greatly troubled.The face which he fancied he had seen was that of Javert.A few nights later Jean Valjean found that Javert had taken lodgings inthe same house where he and Cosette lived. Taking the child by the handhe at once set out for fresh quarters. They passed through silent andempty streets and crossed the river and it seemed to Jean Valjean thatno one was in pursuit. But soon he noticed four men plainly shadowinghim and a shudder went over him. He turned from street to streettrying to escape from the city and at last found himself entrapped in a_cul-de-sac._ What was to be doneThere was no time to turn back. Javert had undoubtedly picketed everyoutlet. Fortunately for Jean Valjean there was a deep shadow in thestreet so that his own movements were unseen.While he stood hesitating a patrol of soldiers entered the street withJavert at their head. They frequently halted. It was evident that theywere exploring every hole and corner and one might judge they wouldtake a quarter of an hour before they reached the spot where JeanValjean was. It was a frightful moment. Capture meant the galleys andCosette lost for ever. There was only one thing possible--to scale thewall which ran along a wide portion of the street. But the difficultywas Cosette there was no thought of abandoning her.First Jean Valjean procured a rope from the lamppost for the lamps hadnot been lit that night owing to the moonlight. This he fastened roundthe child taking the other end between his teeth. Half a minute later hewas on his knees on the top of the wall. Cosette watched him in silence.All at once she heard Jean Valjean saying in a very low voice "Leanagainst the wall. Don't speak and don't be afraid."She felt herself lifted from the ground and before she had time to
comment837,think where she was she found herself on the top of the wall.Jean Valjean grasped her put the child on his back and crawled alongthe wall till he came to a sloping roof. He could hear the thunderingvoice of Javert giving orders to the patrol to search the _cul-de-sac_to the end.Jean Valjean slipped down the roof still carrying Cosette and leapedon the ground. It was a convent garden he had entered.On the other side of the wall the clatter of muskets and theimprecations of Javert resounded from the convent came a hymn.Cosette and Jean Valjean fell on their knees. Presently Jean Valjeandiscovered that the gardener was an old man whose life he had saved atM------ and who in his gratitude was prepared to do anything for M.Madeleine.It ended in Cosette entering the convent school as a pupil and JeanValjean being accepted as the gardener's brother. The good nuns neverleft the precincts of their convent and cared nothing for the worldbeyond their gates.As for Javert he had delayed attempting an arrest even when hissuspicions had been aroused because after all the papers said theconvict was dead. But once convinced he hesitated no longer.His disappointment when Jean Valjean escaped him was midway betweendespair and fury. All night the search went on but it never occurred toJavert that a steep wall of fourteen feet could be climbed by an old manwith a child.Several years passed at the convent.Jean Valjean worked daily in the garden and shared the hut and the nameof the old gardener M. Fauchelevent. Cosette was allowed to see him foran hour every day.The peaceful garden the fragrant flowers the merry cries of thechildren the grave and simple women gradually brought happiness toJean Valjean and his heart melted into gratitude for the security hehad found._IV.--Something Higher than Duty_For six years Cosette and Jean Valjean stayed at the convent and thenon the death of the old gardener Jean Valjean now bearing the name ofFauchelevent decided that as Cosette was not going to be a nun and asrecognition was no longer to be feared it would be well to remove intothe city.So a house was taken in the Rue Plumet and here with a faithfulservant the old man dwelt with his adopted child. But Jean Valjean tookother rooms in Paris in case of accidents.Cosette was growing up. She was conscious of her good looks and she wasin love with a well-connected youth named Marius the son of BaronPontmercy.Jean Valjean learnt of this secret love-making with dismay. The idea ofparting from Cosette was intolerable to him.Then in June 1832 came desperate street fighting in Paris and Mariuswas in command of one of the revolutionary barricades.At this barricade Javert had been captured as a spy and Jean Valjeanwho was known to the revolutionaries found his old implacable enemytied to a post waiting to be shot. Jean Valjean requested to be allowedto blow out Javert's brains himself and permission was given.Holding a pistol in his hand Jean Valjean led Javert who was still
comment838,bound to a lane out of sight of the barricade and there with his knifecut the ropes from the wrists and feet of his prisoner."You are free" he said. "Go and if by chance I leave this place aliveI am to be found under the name of Fauchelevent in the Rue del'Homme-Arm No. 7."Javert walked a few steps and then turned back and cried "You worryme. I would rather you killed me""Go" was the only answer from Jean Valjean.Javert moved slowly away and when he had disappeared Jean Valjeandischarged his pistol in the air.Soon the last stand of the insurgents was at an end and the barricadedestroyed. Jean Valjean who had taken no part in the struggle beyondexposing himself to the bullets of the soldiers was unhurt but Mariuslay wounded and insensible in his arms.The soldiers were shooting down all who tried to escape. The situationwas terrible.There was only one chance for life--underground. An iron grating whichled to the sewers was at his feet. Jean Valjean tore it open anddisappeared with Marius on his shoulders.He emerged after a horrible passage through a grating by the bank ofthe river only to find there the implacable JavertJean Valjean was quite calm."Inspector Javert" he said "help me to carry this man home then dowith me what you please."A cab was waiting for the inspector. He ordered the man to drive to theaddress Jean Valjean gave him. Marius still unconscious was taken tohis grandfather's house."Inspector Javert" said Jean Valjean "grant me one thing more. Let mego home for a minute then you may take me where you will."Javert told the driver to go to Rue de l'Homme-Arm No. 7.When they reached the house Javert said "Go up I will wait here foryou"But before Jean Valjean reached his rooms Javert had gone and thestreet was empty.Javert had not been at ease since his life had been spared. He was nowin horrible uncertainty. To owe his life to an ex-convict to acceptthis debt and then to repay him by sending him back to the galleys wasimpossible. To let a malefactor go free while he Inspector Javert tookhis pay from the government was equally impossible. It seemed there wassomething higher and above his code of duty something he had not comeinto collision with before. The uncertainty of the right thing to bedone destroyed Javert to whom life had hitherto been perfectly plain.He could not live recognising Jean Valjean as his saviour and he couldnot bring himself to arrest Jean Valjean.Inspector Javert made his last report at the police-station and thenunable to face the new conditions of life walked slowly to the riverand plunged into the Seine where the water rolls round and round in anendless whirlpool.Marius recovered and married Cosette and Jean Valjean lived alone. Hehad told Marius who he was--Jean Valjean an escaped convict and Mariusand Cosette gradually saw less and less of the old man.But before Jean Valjean died Marius learnt the whole truth of the heroic
comment839,life of the old man who had rescued him from the lost barricade. For thefirst time he realised that Jean Valjean had come to the barricade onlyto save him knowing him to be in love with Cosette.He hastened with Cosette to Jean Valjean's room but the old man's lasthour had come."Come closer come closer both of you" he cried. "I love you so much.It is good to die like this You love me too my Cosette. I know you'vealways had a fondness for the poor old man. And you M. Pontmercy willalways make Cosette happy. There were several things I wanted to saybut they don't matter now. Come nearer my children. I am happy indying"Cosette and Marius fell on their knees and covered his hands withkisses.Jean Valjean was dead                                   Notre Dame de Paris     Victor Hugo was already eminent as one of the greatest     dramatic poets of his day before he gave to the world in     1831 his great tragic romance "Notre Dame de Paris" of     which the original title was "The Hunchback of Notre Dame."     Hugo has said that the story was suggested to him by the Greek     word _anagke_ Fate which one day he discovered carved on     one of the towers of the famous cathedral. "These Greek     characters" he says "black with age and cut deep into the     stone with the peculiarities of form and arrangement common to     the Gothic caligraphy that marked them the work of some hand     in the Middle Ages and above all the sad and mournful meaning     which they expressed forcibly impressed me." In "Notre Dame"     there is all the tenderness for sorrow and sympathy for the     afflicted which found even fuller and deeper expression     thirty years later in "Les Misrables" while as a study of     the life of Paris of the Middle Ages and of the great church     after which the romance is called the book is still     unrivalled._I.--The Hunchback of Notre Dame_It was January 6 1482 and all Paris was keeping the double festival ofEpiphany and the Feast of Fools.The Lord of Misrule was to be elected and all who were competing forthe post came in turn and made a grimace at a broken window in the greathall of the Palace of Justice. The ugliest face was to be acclaimedvictor by the populace and shouts of laughter greeted the grotesqueappearances.The vote was unanimous in favour of the hunchback of Notre Dame. He hadbut stood at the window and at once had been elected. The square nosethe horseshoe shaped mouth the one eye overhung by a bushy redeyebrow the forked chin and the strange expression of amazementmalice and melancholy--who had seen such a grimaceIt was only when the crowd had carried away the Lord of Misrule intriumph that they understood that the grimace was the hunchback'snatural face. In fact the entire man was a grimace. Humpbacked anenormous head with bristles of red hair broad feet huge handscrooked legs and with all this deformity a wonderful vigour agilityand courage. Such was the newly chosen Lord of Misrule--a giant brokento pieces and badly mended.He was recognised by the crowd in the streets and shouts went up."It is Quasimodo the bell-ringer Quasimodo the hunchback of NotreDame"A pasteboard tiara and imitation robes were placed on him and Quasimodo
comment840,submitted with a sort of proud docility. Then he was seated upon apainted barrow and twelve men raised it to their shoulders and theprocession which included all the vagrants and rascals of Paris setout to parade the city.There was a certain rapture in this journey for Quasimodo. For the firsttime in his life he felt a thrill of vanity. Hitherto humiliation andcontempt had been his portion and now though he was deaf he couldenjoy the plaudits of the mob--mob which he hated because he felt thatit hated him.Suddenly as Quasimodo passed triumphantly along the streets thespectators saw a man dressed like a priest dart out and snatch awaythe gilded crosier from the mock pope.A cry of terror rose. The terrible Quasimodo threw himself from hisbarrow and everyone expected to see him tear the priest limb from limb.Instead he fell on his knees before the priest and submitted to havehis tiara torn from him and his crosier broken.The fraternity of fools determined to defend their pope so abruptlydethroned but Quasimodo placed himself in front of the priest put hisfists up and glared at his assailants so that the crowd melted beforehim.Then at the grave beckoning of the priest Quasimodo followed and thetwo disappeared down a narrow side street.The one human being whom Quasimodo loved was this priest Claude FrolloArchbishop of Paris. And this was quite natural. For it was ClaudeFrollo who had found the hunchback--a deserted forsaken child left in asack at the entrance to Notre Dame and in spite of his deformitieshad taken him fed him adopted him and brought him up. Claude Frollotaught him to speak to read and to write and had made him bell-ringerat Notre Dame.Quasimodo grew up in Notre Dame. Cut off from the world by hisdeformities the church became his universe and his gratitude wasboundless when he was made bell-ringer.The bells had made him deaf but he could understand by signs ClaudeFrollo's wishes and so the archdeacon became the only human being withwhom Quasimodo could hold any communication. Notre Dame and ClaudeFrollo were the only two things in the world for Quasimodo and to bothhe was the most faithful watchman and servant. In the year 1482Quasimodo was about twenty and Claude Frollo thirty-six. The former hadgrown up the latter had grown old._II.--Esmeralda_On that same January 6 1482 a young girl was dancing in an open spacenear a great bonfire in Paris. She was not tall but seemed to be soerect was her figure. She danced and twirled upon an old piece ofPersian carpet and every eye in the crowd was riveted upon her. In hergrace and beauty this gypsy girl seemed more than mortal.One man in the crowd stood more absorbed than the rest in watching thedancer. It was Claude Frollo the archdeacon and though his hair wasgrey and scanty in his deep-set eyes the fire and spirit of youth stillsparkled.When the young girl stopped at last breathless the people applaudedeagerly."Djali" said the gypsy "it's your turn now." And a pretty little whitegoat got up from a corner of the carpet."Djali what month in the year is this"The goat raised his forefoot and struck once upon the tambourine heldout to him.The crowd applauded."Djali what day of the month is it"The goat struck the tambourine six times.The people thought it was wonderful."There is sorcery in this" said a forbidding voice in the crowd. It wasthe voice of the priest Claude Frolic.Then the gypsy began to take up a collection in her tambourine andpresently the crowd dispersed.Later in the day when darkness had fallen as the gypsy and her goatwere proceeding to their lodgings Quasimodo seized hold of the girl andran off with her."Murder Murder" shrieked the unfortunate gypsy."Halt Let the girl go you ruffian" exclaimed in a voice of thundera horseman who appeared suddenly from a cross street. It was a captain
comment841,of the King's Archers armed from head to foot and sword in hand.He tore the gypsy girl from the arms of the astonished Quasimodo andplaced her across his saddle. Before the hunchback could recover fromhis surprise a squadron of royal troops going on duty as extrawatchmen surrounded him and he was seized and bound.The gypsy girl sat gracefully upon the officer's saddle placing bothhands upon the young man's shoulders and gazing at him fixedly. Thenbreaking the silence she said tenderly "What is your name M.l'Officier""Captain Phaebus de Chteaupers at your service my pretty maid" saidthe officer drawing himself up."Thank you."And while Captain Phaebus twirled his mustache she slipped from hishorse and vanished like a flash of lightning."The bird has flown but the bat remains captain" said one of thetroopers tightening Quasimodo's bonds.Quasimodo being deaf understood nothing of the proceedings in the courtnext day when he was charged with creating a disturbance and ofrebellion and disloyalty to the King's Archers.The chief magistrate also being deaf and at the same time anxious toconceal his infirmity understood nothing that Quasimodo said.The hunchback was sentenced to be taken to the pillory in the Grve tobe beaten and to be kept there for two hours.Quasimodo remained utterly impassive while the crowd which yesterdayhad hailed him as Lord of Misrule now greeted him with hooting andderision.The pillory was a simple cube of masonry some ten feet high and hollowwithin. A horizontal wheel of oak was at the top and to this the victimwas bound in a kneeling posture. A very steep flight of stone steps ledto the wheel.All the people laughed merrily when Quasimodo was seen in the pilloryand when he had been beaten by the public executioner they added to thewretched sufferer's misery by insults and occasionally stones. Therewas hardly a spectator in the crowd that had not some grudge real orimagined against the hunchback bell-ringer of Notre Dame.Quasimodo had endured the torturer's whip with patience but he rebelledagainst the stones and struggled in his fetters till the old pillory-wheel creaked on its timbers. Then as he could accomplish nothing byhis struggles his face became quiet again.For a moment the cloud was lightened when the poor victim saw a priestseated on a mule approach in the roadway. A strange smile came on theface of Quasimodo as he glanced at the priest yet when the mule wasnear enough to the pillory for his rider to recognise the prisoner thepriest cast down his eyes turned back hastily as if in a hurry toavoid humiliating appeals and not at all anxious to be greeted by apoor wretch in the pillory.The priest was the archdeacon Claude Frollo. The smile on Quasimodo'sface became bitter and profoundly sad.Time passed. He had been there at least an hour and a half woundedincessantly mocked and almost stoned to death.Suddenly he again struggled in his chains with renewed despair andbreaking the silence which he had kept so stubbornly he cried in ahoarse and furious voice "Water"The exclamation of distress far from exciting compassion onlyincreased the amusement of the Paris mob. Not a voice was raised exceptto mock at his thirst.Quasimodo cast a despairing look upon the crowd and repeated in aheartrending voice "Water"Everyone laughed. A woman aimed a stone at his head saying "That willteach you to wake us at night with your cursed chimes""Here's a cup to drink out of" said a man throwing a broken jug at hisbreast."Water" repeated Quasimodo for the third time.At this moment he saw the gypsy girl and her goat come through thecrowd. His eye gleamed. He did not doubt that she too came to beavenged and to take her turn at him with the rest. He watched hernimbly climb the ladder. Rage and spite choked him. He longed to destroythe pillory and had the lightning of his eye had power to blast thegypsy girl would have been reduced to ashes long before she reached theplatform. Without a word she approached the sufferer loosened a gourdfrom her girdle and raised it gently to the parched lips of the
comment842,miserable man. Then from his eye a great tear trickled and rolledslowly down the misshapen face so long convulsed with despair.The gypsy girl smilingly pressed the neck of the gourd to Quasimodo'sjagged mouth.He drank long draughts his thirst was feverish. When he had done thepoor wretch put out his black lips to kiss the hand which had helpedhim. But the girl remembering the violent attempt of the previousnight and not quite free from distrust withdrew her hand quickly.Quasimodo fixed upon her a look of reproach and unspeakable sorrow.The sight of this beautiful girl succouring a man in the pillory sodeformed and wretched seemed sublime and the people were immediatelyaffected by it. They clapped their hands and shouted "Nol Nol"Esmeralda--for that was the name of the gypsy girl--came down from thepillory and a mad woman called out "Come down Come down You will goup again"Presently Quasimodo was released and the mob thereupon dispersed._III.--The Archdeacon's Passion_In spite of the austerity of Claude Frollo's life pious peoplesuspected him of magic. His silence and secretiveness encouraged thisfeeling. He was known to be at work in the long hours of the night inhis cell in Notre Dame and he wandered about the streets like aspectre.Whenever the gypsy girl placed her carpet within sight of ClaudeFrollo's cell and began to dance the priest turned from his books andresting his head in his hands gazed at her. Then he would go down intothe public thoroughfares lured on by some burning passion within.Quasimodo too would desist from his bell-ringing to look at thedancing girl.The hotter the fire of passion burned within the priest the fartherEsmeralda moved from him. He discovered that she was in love withCaptain Phoebus her rescuer and this knowledge added fuel to theflames.One purpose now was clear to him. He would give up all for the dancinggirl and she should be his. But if Esmeralda refused to come to himthen the archdeacon resolved that she should die before she marriedanyone else. At any time he could have her arrested on the charge ofsorcery and the goat's tricks would easily procure a conviction.Captain Phoebus having invited Esmeralda to meet him at a wineshop thepriest followed the couple and when the captain to whom the girl wasthe merest diversion began to make love Claude Frollo unable tocontain himself rushed in unobserved and stabbed him.Captain Phoebus was taken up for dead and the priest vanished assilently as he had come. The soldiers of the watch found Esmeralda andsaid "This is the sorceress who has stabbed our captain." So Esmeralda
comment843,was brought to trial on the charge of witchcraft and every day thepriest from Notre Dame came into court.It was a tedious process for not only was the girl on trial but thegoat also in accordance with the custom of the times was under arrest.All that Esmeralda wanted to know was whether Phoebus was still aliveand she was told by the judges he was dying.The indictment against her was "that with her accomplice the bewitchedgoat she did murder and stab in league with the powers of darkness bythe aid of charms and spells a captain of the king's troops onePhoebus de Chteaupers." And it was vain that the girl denied vehementlyher guilt."How do you explain the charge brought against you" said the president."I have told you already I do not know" said Esmeralda in a brokenvoice. "It was a priest--a priest who is always pursuing me""That's it" said the president "it is a goblin monk."The goat having performed his simple tricks in the presence of thecourt and Esmeralda still refusing to admit her guilt the presidentordered her to be put to the question.She was placed on the rack and at the first turn of the screw promisedto confess everything. Then the lawyers put a number of questions toher and Esmeralda answered "Yes" in every case. It was plain that herspirit was utterly broken.Then the court having read the confession sentence was pronounced. Shewas to be taken to the Grve where the pillory stood and in atonementfor the crimes confessed there hanged and strangled on the city gibbet"and likewise this your goat.""It must be a dream" the girl murmured when she heard the sentence.But if Esmeralda had yielded at the first turn of the rack nothingwould make her yield to Claude Frollo when he came to see her in prison.In vain he promised her life and liberty if she would only agree to lovehim. In vain he reproached her with having brought disturbance anddisquiet into his soul. All that Esmeralda could say was "Have pity onme--have pity on me" But she would not give up Phoebus. And when thepriest declared Phoebus was dead she turned upon him and called him"monster and assassin" Claude Frollo unable to move her decided tolet her die and the day of execution arrived. As for Captain Phoebushe recovered but as he was about to be engaged to a young lady ofwealth he thought it better to say nothing about the gypsy girl.But Esmeralda was not hanged that day. Just as the hangman's assistantswere about to do their work Quasimodo who had been watching everythingfrom his gallery in Notre Dame slid down by a rope to the groundrushed at the two executioners flung them to the earth with his hugefists seized the gypsy girl as a child might a doll and with onebound was in the church holding her above his head and shouting in atremendous voice "Sanctuary""Sanctuary Sanctuary" The mob took up the cry and ten thousand handsclapped approval.The hangman stood stupefied. Within the precincts of Notre Dame theprisoner was secure the cathedral was a sure refuge all human justiceended at its threshold._IV.--The Attack on Notre Dame_Quasimodo did not stop running and shouting "Sanctuary" till he reacheda cell built over the aisles in Notre Dame. Here he deposited Esmeraldacarefully untied the ropes which bruised her arms and spread amattress on the floor then he left her and returned with a basket ofprovisions.The girl lifted her eyes to thank him but could not utter a word sofrightful was he to look at. Quasimodo only said "I frighten youbecause I am ugly. Do not look at me then but listen. All day you muststay here at night you can walk anywhere about the church. But day ornight do not leave the church or you will be lost. They would killyou and I should die." Then he vanished but when she awoke nextmorning she saw him at the window of her cell."Don't be frightened" he said. "I am your friend. I only came to see if
comment844,you were asleep. I am deaf you did not know that I never realised howugly I was till now. I seem to you like some awful beast eh Andyou--you are a sunbeam"As the days went by calm returned to Esmeralda's soul and with calm hadcome the sense of security and with security hope.Two forces were now at work to remove her from Notre Dame.The archdeacon leaving Paris to avoid her execution had returned--tolearn where Esmeralda was situated. From his cell in Notre Dame heobserved her movements and in his madness jealous of Quasimodo'sservice to her resolved to have her removed. If she still refused himhe would give her up to justice.Esmeralda's friends all the gypsies vagrants cutthroats andpick-pockets of Paris to the number of six thousand also resolved thatthey would forcibly rescue her from Notre Dame lest some evil shouldovertake her. Paris at that time had neither police nor adequate citywatchmen.At midnight the monstrous army of vagrants set out and it was not untilthey were outside the church that they lit their torches. Quasimodoevery night on the watch at once supposed that the invaders had somefoul purpose against Esmeralda and determined to defend the church atall cost.The battle raged furiously at the great west doors. Hammers pincersand crow-bars were at work outside. Quasimodo retaliated by heavingfirst a great beam of wood and then stones and other missiles on thebesiegers. Finally when they had reared a tall ladder to the firstgallery and had crowded it with men Quasimodo by sheer force pushedthe ladder away and it tottered and fell right back. The battle onlyended on the arrival of a large company of King's Archers when thevagrants defeated by Quasimodo retired fighting.While the battle raged Claude Frollo with the aid of a disreputableyoung student of his acquaintance persuaded Esmeralda to leave thechurch by a secret door at the back and to escape by the river. Thepriest was so hidden in his cloak that the girl did not recognise himtill they were alone in the city. In the Grve at the foot of thepublic scaffold where the gallows stood Claude Frollo made his lastappeal."Listen" he said. "I have saved you and I can save you altogether ifyou choose. Choose between me and the gibbet"There was silence and then Esmeralda said "It is less horrible to methan you are."He poured out his soul passionately telling her that his life wasnothing without her love but the girl never moved.It was daylight now."For the last time will you be mine"She answered emphatically "No"Then he called out as loud as he could and presently a body of armedmen appeared. Soon the public hangman was aroused and the executionwhich had been interrupted by Quasimodo's heroic rescue was carried out.Meantime what of QuasimodoHe had rushed to her cell when the king's troops having beaten off thevagrants entered the church and it was empty Then he had exploredevery nook and cranny of Notre Dame and again and again gone the roundof the church. For an hour he sat in despair his body convulsed bysobs.Suddenly he remembered that Claude Frollo had a secret key and decidedthat the priest must have carried her off.At that very moment Claude returned to Notre Dame after handing overEsmeralda to the hangman. Quasimodo watched him ascend to the balustrade
comment845,at the top of the tower and then followed him the priest's attentionwas too absorbed to hear the hunchback's step.Claude rested his arms on the balustrade and gazed intently at thegallows in the Grve. Quasimodo tried to make out what it was the prieststared at and then he recognised Esmeralda in the hangman's arms on theladder and in another second the hangman had done his work.A demoniac laugh broke from the livid lips of Claude Frollo Quasimodocould not hear this laughter but he saw it.He rushed furiously upon the archdeacon and with his great fists hehurled Claude Frollo into the abyss over which he leaned.The archdeacon caught at a gutter and hung suspended for a few minutesand then fell--more than two hundred feet.Quasimodo raised his eyes to the gypsy whose body still swung from thegibbet and then lowered them to the shapeless mass on the pavementbeneath. "And these were all I have ever loved" he said sobbing.He was never seen again in Notre Dame.Some two years later when there were certain clearances in the vaultwhere the body of Esmeralda had been deposited the skeleton of a mandeformed and twisted was found in close embrace with the skeleton of awoman. A little silk bag which Esmeralda had always worn was around theneck of the skeleton of the woman.                                   The Toilers of the Sea     Victor Hugo's third great romance "The Toilers of the Sea"     "Les Travailleurs de la Mer" published in 1866 was written     during his exile in Guernsey. Of all Hugo's romances both in     prose and in verse none surpasses this for sheer splendour of     imagination and diction for eloquence and sublimity of truth.     It is in short an idyll of passion adventure and     self-sacrifice. The description of the moods and mysteries of     the sea is well-nigh incomparable and not even in the whole     of Hugo's works can there be found anything more vivid than     Gilliatt's battle with the devil-fish. The scene of the story     is laid in the Channel Islands and the book itself is     dedicated to the "Isle of Guernsey severe yet gentle my     present asylum my probable tomb." The story was immensely     successful on its appearance and was at once translated into     several European languages._I.--A Lonely Man_A Guernseyman named Gilliatt who was avoided by his neighbours onaccount of lonely habits and a certain love of nature which thesuspicious people regarded as indicating some connection with the devil
comment846,was one day returning on a rising tide from his fishing when he fanciedhe saw in a certain projection of the cliff a shadow of a man.The place probably attracted Gilliatt's gaze because it was a favouritesojourn of his--a natural seat cut in the great cliffs and affording amagnificent view of the sea. It was a place to which some uninitiatedtraveller would climb with delight from the shore and sit entranced bythe scene before him all oblivious of the rising ocean till he wascompletely cut off from escape. No shout would reach the ear of man fromthat desolate giant's chair in the rock.Gilliatt steered his ship nearer to the cliff and saw that the shadowwas a man. The sea was already high. The rock was encircled. Gilliattdrew nearer. The man was asleep.He was attired in black and looked like a priest. Gilliatt had neverseen him before. The fisherman wore off skirted the rock wall andapproaching so close to the dangerous cliff that by standing on thegunwale of his sloop he could touch the foot of the sleeper succeededin arousing him.The man roused and muttered "I was looking about."Gilliatt bade him jump into the boat. When he had landed this youngpriest who had a somewhat feminine cast of features a clear eye and agrave manner Gilliatt perceived that he was holding out a sovereign ina very white hand. Gilliatt moved the hand gently away. There was apause. Then the young man bowed and left him.Gilliatt had forgotten all about this stranger when a voice hailed him.It was one of the inhabitants driving by quickly."There is news Gilliatt--at the Braves.""What is it""I am too hurried to tell you the story. Go up to the house and youwill learn."The Braves was the residence of a man named Lethierry. He had raisedhimself to a position of wealth by starting the first steamboat betweenGuernsey and the coast of Normandy he called this vessel La Durandethe natives who prophesied evil of such a frightful invention calledit the Devil's Boat. But the Durande went to and fro without disasterand Lethierry's gold increased. There was nothing in all the universe heloved so much as this marvellous ship worked by steam. Next to theDurande he most loved his pretty niece Drouchette who kept house forhim.One day as Gilliatt was walking over the snow-covered roadsDrouchette who was ahead of him had stopped for a moment and
comment847,stooping down had written something with her finger in the snow. Whenthe fisherman reached the place he found that the mischievous littlecreature had written his name there. Ever since that hour in the almostunbroken solitude of his life Gilliatt had thought about Drouchette.Now that he heard of news at the Braves the lonely man made his way toLethierry's house which was the nest of Drouchette.The news was soon told. The Durande was lost Presently amid thedetails of the story--the Durande had been wrecked in a fog on theterrible rocks known as the Douvres--one thing emerged the engines wereintact. To rescue the Durande was impossible but the machinery mightstill be saved. These engines were unique. To construct others likethem money was wanting but to find the artificer would have been stillmore difficult. The constructor was dead. The machinery had cost twothousand pounds. As long as these engines existed it might almost besaid that there was no shipwreck. The loss of the engines alone wasirreparable.Now if ever a dream had appeared wild and impracticable it was that ofsaving the engines then embedded between the Douvres. The idea ofsending a crew to work upon those rocks was absurd. It was the season ofheavy seas. Besides on the narrow ledge of the highest part of the rockthere was scarcely room for one person. To save the engines thereforeit would be necessary for a man to go to the Douvres to be alone inthat sea alone at five leagues from the coast alone in that region ofterrors for entire weeks in the presence of dangers foreseen andunforeseen--without supplies in the face of hunger and nakednesswithout companionship save that of death.A pilot present in the room delivered judgment."No it is all over. The man does not exist who could go there andrescue the machinery of the Durande.""If I don't go" said the engineer of the lost ship who loved thoseengines "it is because nobody could do it""If he existed----" continued the pilot.Drouchette turned her head impulsively and interrupted."I would marry him" she said innocently.There was a pause. A man made his way out of the crowd and standingbefore her pale and anxious said "You would marry him MissDrouchette"It was Gilliatt. All eyes were turned towards him. Lethierry had justbefore stood upright and gazed about him. His eyes glittered with astrange light. He took off his sailor's cap and threw it on the groundthen looked solemnly before him and without seeing any of the personspresent said Drouchette should be his. "I pledge myself to it in God'sname"_II.--The Prey of the Rocks_The two perpendicular forms called the Douvres held fast between themlike an architrave between two pillars the wreck of the Durande. Thespectacle thus presented was a vast portal in the midst of the sea. Itmight have been a titanic cromlech planted there in mid-ocean by handsaccustomed to proportion their labours to the great deep. Its wildoutline stood well defined against the clear sky when Gilliattapproached in his sloop.The rocks thus holding fast and exhibiting their prey were terrible tobehold. There was a menace in the attitude of the rocks. They seemed tobe biding their time. Nothing could be more suggestive of haughtinessand arrogance the conquered vessel the triumphant abyss. The tworocks still streaming with the tempest of the day before were like twowrestlers sweating from a recent struggle. Up to a certain height theywere completely bearded with seaweed above this their steep haunchesglittered at points like polished armour. They seemed ready to begin thestrife again. The imagination might have pictured them as two monstrousarms reaching upwards from the gulf and exhibiting to the tempest thelifeless body of the ship. If Gilliatt had known how she came to bethere he might have been more awed by the tremendous spectacle. Thecause was an accident and yet a purposed act.Clubin the captain as smug a hypocrite as ever scuttled a ship hadintended to run the Durande on the Hanways. His belt contained three
comment848,thousand pounds. He meant to lose the ship on the Hanways a mile fromshore and when the passengers had rowed away pretending that he wouldgo down with the ship Clubin purposed to swim to land get on board apirate ship and be off to the East. His little drama had been actedout the boats had rowed away everybody praising Captain Clubin whowould not abandon his ship. But when the fog cleared--horror ofhorrors--Clubin found himself not on the Hanways but on the Douvresnot one mile from shore but five milesClubin saw a ship in the distance. He determined to swim to a rock fromwhich he could be seen and make signals of distress. He undressedleaving his clothing on deck. He retained nothing but his leather beltand then precipitating himself head first plunged into the sea. As hedived from a height he plunged heavily. He sank deep in the watertouched the bottom skirted for a moment the submarine rocks thenstruck out to regain the surface. At that moment he felt himself seizedby one foot.But of all this Gilliatt arriving at the Douvres knew nothing. He wasabsorbed by the spectacle of the ship held in mid-air. And what did hefind The machinery was saved but it was lost. The ocean saved it onlyto demolish it at leisure--like a cat playing with her prey. Its fatewas to suffer there and to be dismembered day by day. It was to be theplaything of the savage amusements of the sea. For what could be doneThat this vast block of mechanism and gear at once massive anddelicate condemned to fixity by its weight delivered up in thatsolitude to the destructive elements could under the frown of thatimplacable spot escape from slow destruction seemed a madness even toimagine.Gilliatt looked about him.When he had made a lodging for himself and had suffered the misfortuneof losing the basket containing his provisions Gilliatt considered hisdifficulties.In order to raise the engine of the Durande from the wreck in which itwas three-fourths buried with any chance of success--in order toaccomplish a salvage in such a place and such a season it seemed almostnecessary to be a legion of men. Gilliatt was alone. A completeapparatus of carpenter's and engineer's tools and implements werewanted. Gilliatt had a saw a hatchet a chisel and a hammer. He wantedboth a good workshop and a good shed Gilliatt had not a roof to coverhim. Provisions too were necessary on that bare rock but he had noteven bread.Anyone who could have seen Gilliatt working on the rock during all thatfirst week might have been puzzled to determine the nature of hisoperations. He seemed to be no longer thinking of the Durande or the twoDouvres. He was busy only among the breakers. He seemed absorbed in
comment849,saving the smaller parts of the shipwreck. He took advantage of everyhigh tide to strip the reefs of everything that the ship-wreck haddistributed among them. He went from rock to rock picking up whateverthe sea had scattered--tatters of sail-cloth pieces of iron splintersof panels shattered planking broken yards here a beam there a chainthere a pulley.He lived upon limpets hermit-crabs and rain-water. He was surroundedby a screaming garrison of gulls cormorants and sea-mews. The deepboom of the waves among the caves and reefs was never out of his ears.By day he was roasted in the terrific heat which beat with pitilessforce on this exposed pinnacle at night he was chilled to the marrow bythe cold of the open sea. And for ever he was hungry thirsty--famished.One day in exploring for salvage some of the grottoes of his rockGilliatt came upon a cave within a cave so beautiful with sea-flowersthat it seemed the retreat of a sea-goddess. The shells were likejewels the water held eternal moonlight. Some of the flowers were likesapphires. Standing in this dripping grotto with his feet on the edgeof a probably bottomless pool Gilliatt suddenly became aware in thetransparence of that water of the approach of some mystic form. Aspecies of long ragged band was moving amid the oscillation of thewaves. It did not float but darted about at its own will. It had anobject was advancing somewhere rapidly. The thing had something of theform of a jester's bauble with points which hung flabby and undulating.It seemed covered with a dust incapable of being washed away by thewater. It was more than horrible it was foul. It seemed to be seekingthe darker portion of the cavern where at last it vanished.Gilliatt returned to his work. He had a notion. Since the time of thecarpenter-mason of Salbris who in the sixteenth century without otherhelper than a child his son with ill-fashioned tools in the chamberof the great clock at La Charit-sur-Loire resolved at one stroke fiveor six problems in statics and dynamics inextricably intervolved--sincethe time of that grand and marvellous achievement of the poor workmanwho found means without breaking a single piece of wire withoutthrowing one of the teeth of the wheels out of gear to lower in onepiece by a marvellous simplification from the second story of theclock tower to the first that massive clock large as a room nothingthat could be compared with the project which Gilliatt was meditating
comment850,had ever been attempted.After incredible exertions the machinery was ready for lowering intothe sloop. Gilliatt had constructed tackle a regulating gear and madeall sure. The long labour was finished the first act had been thesimplest of all. He could put to sea. To-morrow he would be in Guernsey.But no. He had waited for the tide to lift the sloop as near to thesuspended engines as possible and now the funnel which he had loweredwith the paddle-boxes prevented the sloop from getting out of thelittle gorge. It was necessary to wait for the tide to fall. Gilliattdrew his sheepskin about him pulled his cap over his eyes and lyingdown beside the engine was soon asleep.When he woke it was to feel the coming of a storm. A fresh task wasforced upon this famished man. It was necessary to build a breakwater inthe gorge. He flew to this task. Nails driven into the cracks of therocks beams lashed together with cordage cat-heads from the Durandebinding strakes pulley-sheaves chains--with these materials thehaggard dweller of the rock built his barrier against the wrath of God.Then the storm came._III.--The Devil-Fish_When the awful rage of the storm had passed and the barrier which hehad repaired in the midst of the tempest hung like a broken arm acrossthe gorge Gilliatt maddened by hunger took advantage of the recedingtide to go in search of crayfish. Half naked and with his open knifebetween his teeth he sprang from rock to rock. In hunting a crab hefound himself once more in the mysterious grotto that glittered withjewel-like flowers. He noticed a fissure above the level of the water.The crab was probably there. He thrust in his hand as far as he wasable and groped about in that dusky aperture.Suddenly he felt himself seized by the arm. A strange indescribablehorror thrilled through him.Some living thing--thin rough flat cold slimy--had twisted itselfround his naked arm. It crept upward towards his chest. Its pressure waslike a tightening cord its steady persistence like that of a screw. Inless than a moment some mysterious spiral form had passed round hiswrist and elbow and had reached his shoulder. A sharp point penetratedbeneath the arm-pit.Gilliatt recoiled but he had scarcely power to move. He was as itwere nailed to the place. With his left hand which was disengaged heseized his knife and made a desperate effort to withdraw his arm. Heonly succeeded in disturbing his persecutor which wound itself stilltighter. It was supple as leather strong as steel cold as night.A second form--sharp elongated and narrow--issued out of the crevicelike a tongue out of monstrous jaws. It seemed to lick his naked bodythen suddenly stretching out it became longer and thinner as it creptover his skin and wound itself round him. A terrible sense of anguishcomparable to nothing he had ever known compelled all his muscles tocontract. He felt upon his skin a number of flat rounded points. Itseemed as if innumerable suckers had fastened to his flesh and wereabout to drink his blood.A third long undulating shape issued from the hole in the rock feltabout his body lashed round his ribs like a cord and fixed itselfthere. There was sufficient light for Gilliatt to see the repulsiveforms which had entangled themselves about him. A fourth ligature but
comment851,this one swift as an arrow darted towards his stomach.These living things crept and glided about him he felt the points ofpressure like sucking mouths change their places from time to time.Suddenly a large round flattened glutinous mass shot from beneath thecrevice. It was the centre The thongs were attached to it like spokesto the nave of a wheel. In the middle of this slimy mass appeared twoeyes. The eyes were fixed on Gilliatt.He recognised the devil-fish.Gilliatt had but one resource--his knife.He knew that these frightful monsters are vulnerable in only onepoint--the head. Standing half naked in the water his body lashed bythe foul antennae of the devil-fish Gilliatt looked at the devil-fishand the devilfish looked at Gilliatt.With the devil-fish as with a furious bull there is a certain momentin the conflict which must be seized. It is the instant when the bulllowers its neck it is the instant when the devil-fish advances itshead. The movement is rapid. He who loses that moment is destroyed.Suddenly it loosened another antenna from the rock and darting it athim seized him by the left arm. At the same moment it advanced itshead.Rapid as was this movement Gilliatt by a gigantic effort plunged theblade of his knife into the flat slimy substance and with a movementlike the flourish of a whip described a circle round the eyes andwrenched off the head as a man would draw a tooth.The four hundred suckers dropped at once from the man and the rock. Themass sank to the bottom of the water.Nearly exhausted Gilliatt plunged into the water to heal by frictionthe numberless purple swellings which were pricking all over his body.He advanced up the recess. Something caught his eye. He approachednearer. The thing was a bleached skeleton nothing was left but thewhite bones. Yes something else. A leather belt and a tobacco-tin. Onthe belt Gilliatt read the name of Clubin in the tobacco-tin which heopened with his knife he found three thousand pounds.When Gilliatt reached his sloop with this belt and box in hispossession he found to his unspeakable horror that she had beenmaking water fast. Had he come an hour later he would have found nothingabove water but the funnel of the steamer.He slung a tarpaulin by chains overboard and hung it over the hole.Pressure of the sea held it tight. The wound was stanched. Gilliattbegan to bale for dear life. As he emptied the hole the tarpaulin bulgedin as if a fist were pushing it from outside. He ran for his clothesbrought them and stuffed them into the wound.He was saved--for a few moments.Death was certain. He had succeeded in the impossible to fail in what ashipwright might have mended in a few minutes.Upon that solitary rock he had been subjected by turns to all the variedand cruel tortures of nature. He had conquered his isolation conqueredhunger conquered thirst conquered cold conquered fever conquered
comment852,labour conquered sleep. A dismal irony was then the end of all.Gilliatt climbed to the top of the rock and gazed wildly into space. Hehad no clothing. He stood naked in the midst of that immensity.Then overwhelmed by the sense of that unknown infinity like onebewildered by a strange persecution confronting the shadows of nightin the midst of the murmur of the waves the swell the foam thebreeze under that vast diffusion of force having around him andbeneath him the ocean above him the constellations under him the greatunfathomable deep he sank gave up the struggle laid down upon therock humbled and uplifting his joined hands towards the terribledepths he cried aloud "Have mercy"When he issued from his swoon the sun was high in a cloudless sky. Theblessed heat had saved the poor broken naked man upon the rock. Herose up refreshed and filled with divine energy. A day's work sufficedto mend the gap in the sloop's side. On the following day dressed inthe tattered garments which had stuffed the rent with a favourablebreeze and a good sea Gilliatt pushed off from the Douvres._IV.--Fate's Last Blow_Gilliatt arrived in harbour at night. He went ashore in his rags andhovered for a while about the darkness of Lethierry's house. Then hemade his way into the garden like an animal returning to its hole. Hesat himself down and looked about him. He saw the garden the pathwaysthe beds of flowers the house the two windows of Drouchette'schamber. He felt it horrible to be obliged to breathe he did what hecould to prevent it.To see those windows was almost too much happiness for Gilliatt.Suddenly he saw her.Drouchette approached. She stopped. She walked back a few pacesstopped again then returned and sat upon a wooden bench. The moon wasin the trees a few clouds floated among the pale stars the seamurmured to the shadows in an undertone.Gilliatt felt a thrill through him. He was the most miserable and yetthe happiest of men. He knew not what to do. His delirious joy at seeingher annihilated him. He gazed upon her neck--her hair.A noise aroused them both--her from her reverie him from his ecstasy.Someone was walking in the garden. It was the footsteps of a man.Drouchette raised her eyes. The footsteps drew nearer then ceased.Accident had so placed the branches that Drouchette could see thenewcomer while Gilliatt could not. He looked at Drouchette.She was quite pale her mouth was partly open as with a suppressed cryof surprise. Her surprise was enchantment mingled with timidity. Sheseemed as if transfigured by that presence as if the being whom she sawbefore her belonged not to this earth.The stranger who was to Gilliatt only a shadow spoke. A voice issuedfrom the trees softer than the voice of a woman yet it was the voiceof a man. Gilliatt heard many words then "Mademoiselle you are poorsince this morning I am rich. Will you have me for your husband I loveyou. God made not the heart of man to be silent. He has promised himeternity with the intention that he should not be alone. There is for mebut one woman on the earth it is you. I think of you as of a prayer. Myfaith is in God and my hope in you."Gilliatt heard them talking--the woman he loved the man whose shadowlay upon the path. Presently he heard the invisible man exclaim"Mademoiselle You are silent.""What would you have me say"The man said "I wait for your reply.""God has heard it" answered Drouchette.Then she went forward a moment afterwards instead of one shadow uponthe path there were two. They mingled together and became one.Gilliatt saw at his feet the embrace of those two shadows.Suddenly a noise burst forth at a distance. A voice was heard crying
comment853,"Help" and the harbour bell rang out on the night air.It was Lethierry ringing the bell furiously. He had wakened and seenthe funnel of the Durande in the harbour. The sight had driven himalmost crazy. He rushed out crying "Help" and pulling the great bell ofthe harbour. Suddenly he stopped abruptly. A man had just turned thecorner of the quay. It was Gilliatt. Lethierry rushed at him embracedhim hugged him cried over him and dragged him into the lower room ofthe Braves. "Give me your word that I am not crazy" he kept crying."It can't be true. Not a tap not a pin missing. It is incredible. Wehave only to put in a little oil. What a revolution You are my childmy son my Providence. Brave lad To go and fetch my good old engine. Inthe open sea among those cut-throat rocks. I have seen some strangethings in my life nothing like that."Gilliatt gave him the belt and the box containing the three thousandpounds stolen by Clubin. Again Lethierry was thrown into a wildamazement. "Did anyone ever see a man like Gilliatt" he concluded. "Iwas struck down to the ground I was a dead man. He comes and sets me upagain as firm as ever. And all the while I was never thinking of him. Hehad gone clean out of my mind but I recollect everything now. Poor ladAh by the way you know you are to marry Drouchette."Gilliatt leaned with his back against the wall like one who staggersand said in a tone very low but distinct "No."Lethierry started. "How no""I do not love her."Lethierry laughed that idea to scorn. He was wild with joy. Gilliatthis son his preserver should marry Drouchette--he and none other.Neighbours had begun to flock in roused by the bell. The room wascrowded. Drouchette presently glided in and was espied by Lethierry inthe crowd. He seized her told her the news. "We are rich again And youshall marry the prodigy who has done this thing." His eye fell upon theman who had followed Drouchette into the room it was the young priestwhom Gilliatt had rescued from the seat in the rock. "Ah you are thereMonsieur le Cur" exclaimed the old man "you will marry these youngpeople for us. There's a fine fellow" he cried and pointed toGilliatt.Gilliatt's appearance was hideous. He was in the condition in which hehad that morning set sail from the rocks--in rags his bare elbowsshowing through his sleeves his beard long his hair rough and wildhis eyes bloodshot his skin peeling his hands covered with wounds hisfeet naked and torn. Some of the blisters left by the devil-fish werestill visible upon his arms."This is my son-in-law" cried Lethierry. "How he has struggled with thesea He is all in rags. What shoulders What hands There's a splendidfellow"But Lethierry did not know Gilliatt. The poor broken creature escapedfrom the room. He himself made all the arrangements for the marriage ofthe priest and Drouchette he placed the special license in theirhands secured a priest for the purpose and secured passages for themin the ship waiting in the roads for England.When he had done all this he made his way to the seat in the cliff and
comment854,sat there waiting to see the ship appear round the bight and disappearon the horizon.The ship appeared with the slowness of a phantom. Gilliatt watched it.Suddenly a touch and a sensation of cold caused him to look down. Thesea had reached his feet.He lowered his eyes then raised them again. The ship was quite near.The rock in which the rains had hollowed out this giant's seat was socompletely vertical and there was so much water at its base that incalm weather vessels were able to pass without danger within a fewcables' length.The ship was already abreast of the rock. Gilliatt could see the stir oflife on the sunlit deck. The deck was as visible as if he had stood uponit. He saw bride and bridegroom sitting side by side like two birdswarming themselves in the noonday sun. A celestial light was in thosetwo faces formed by innocence. The silence was like the calm of heaven.The vessel passed. He watched her till her masts and sails formed only awhite obelisk gradually decreasing against the horizon. He felt thatthe water had reached his waist. Sea-mews and cormorants flew about himrestlessly as if anxious to warn him of his danger.The ship was rapidly growing less.There was no foam around the rock where he sat no wave beat against itsgranite sides. The water rose peacefully. It was nearly level withGilliatt's shoulders.The birds were hovering about him uttering short cries. Only his headwas now visible. The tide was nearly at the full. Evening wasapproaching.Gilliatt's eyes continued fixed upon the vessel on the horizon. Theirexpression resembled nothing earthly. A strange lustre shone in theircalm and tragic depths. There was in them the peace of vanished hopesthe calm but sorrowful acceptance of an end far different from hisdreams. By degrees the dusk of heaven began to dawn in them thoughgazing still upon the point in space. At the same moment the wide watersround the rock and the vast gathering twilight closed upon them.At the moment when the vessel vanished on the horizon the head ofGilliatt disappeared. Nothing now was visible but the sea.                                   The Man Who Laughs     "The Man Who Laughs" "L'Homme qui Rit" was called by its     author "A Romance of English History" and was written during     the period Hugo spent in exile in Guernsey. Like "The Toilers     of the Sea" its immediate predecessor the main theme of the     story is human heroism confronted with the superhuman tyranny     of blind chance. As a passionate cry on behalf of the tortured     and deformed and the despised and oppressed of the world     "The Man Who Laughs" is irresistible. Of it Hugo himself says     in the preface "The true title of this book should be     'Aristocracy'"--inasmuch as it was intended as an arraignment     of the nobility for their vices crimes and selfishness. "The     Man Who Laughs" was first published in 1869._I.--The Child_Ursus and Homo were old friends. Ursus was a man Homo a wolf. The twowent about together from town to town from country-side tocountry-side. Ursus lived in a small van upon wheels which Homo drew byday and guarded by night.Ursus was a juggler a ventriloquist a doctor and a misanthrope. Hewas also something of a poet. The wolf and he had grown old together.One bitterly cold night in January 1690 when Ursus and his van were atWeymouth a small vessel put off from Portland. It contained a dozenpeople and it left behind on the rock and alone a small boy.
comment855,The people were called Comprachicos. They bought children andunderstood how to mutilate and deform them thus making them valuablefor exhibition at fairs. But an act of parliament had just been passedto destroy the trade of the Comprachicos. Hence this flight fromPortland and the forsaking of the child.The vessel was wrecked and all on board perished off the coast ofFrance but not before one of the passengers had inscribed on a piece ofparchment the name of the child and the name of a certain Englishprisoner who could identify the child. This parchment was sealed in abottle and left to the waves.The child watched the disappearance of the boat. He was stupefied atfinding himself alone the men who had left him were the only people hehad ever known and they had failed him. He did not know where he wasbut he knew that he must seek food and shelter. It was very cold anddark and the boy was barefoot but he made his way across Portland andthe Chesil bank and gained the mainland.He found in the snow a footprint and set out to follow it. Presently heheard a groan and came to the end of the footprints. The woman abeggar-woman who had lost her way had uttered the groan. She had sunkdown in the snow and was dead when the boy found her. He heard a cryand discovered a baby wretched with cold but still alive clinging toits dead mother's breast.The boy took the baby in his arms. Forsaken himself he had heard thecry of distress and wrapping the infant in his coat he pursued hisjourney in the teeth of the freezing wind. Four hours had passed sincethe boat had sailed away this baby was the first living person the boyhad met.Struggling along with his burden the boy reached Weymouth then ahamlet and a suburb of the town and port of Melcombe Regis. He knockedat doors and windows no one stirred. For one thing everybody wasasleep and those who were awakened by the knock were afraid of openinga window for fear of some sick vagabond being outside.Suddenly the boy heard in the darkness a grinding of teeth and a growl.The silence was so dreadful that he was glad of the noise and moved inthe direction whence it came. He saw a carriage on wheels with smokecoming out of the roof through a funnel and a light within.Something perceived his approach and growled furiously and tugged at itschain. At the same time a head was put out of a window in the van."Be quiet there" said the head and the noise ceased. "Is anyonethere" said the head again."Yes I" said the child."You Who are you""I am very tired and cold and hungry" said the child."We can't all be as happy as a lord. Go away" said the head and thewindow was shut down.The child turned away in despair. But no sooner was the window shut thanthe door at the top of the steps opened and the same voice called outfrom within the van "Well why don't you come in What sort of a fellowis this who is cold and hungry and who stays outside"The boy climbed up the three steps with difficulty carrying the babyand hesitated for a moment at the door. On the ceiling was written inlarge letters    URSUS PHILOSOPHERIt was the house of Ursus the child had come to. Homo had been growlingUrsus speaking.The child made out near the stove an elderly man who as he stoodreached the roof of the caravan."Come in Put down your bundle" said Ursus. "How wet you are and halffrozen Take off those rags you young villain"He tore off the boy's rags clothed him in a man's shirt and a knittedjacket rubbed the boy's limbs and feet with a woollen rag found there
comment856,was nothing frost-bitten and gave him his own scanty supper to eat."I have worked all day and far into the night on an empty stomach"muttered Ursus "and now this dreadful boy swallows up my food. Howeverit's all one. He shall have the bread the potato and the bacon but Iwill have the milk."Just then the infant began to wail. Ursus fed it with the milk by meansof a small bottle took off the tatters in which it was wrapped andswathed it in a large piece of dry clean linen.When the boy had finished his supper Ursus asked him who he was but hecould get no answer save that he had been abandoned that night."But you must have relations since you have this baby sister.""It is not my sister it is a baby that I found."Ursus listened to the boy's story. Then he brought out an old bearskinlaid it on a chest placed the sleeping infant on this and told the boyto lie down beside the baby. Ursus rolled the bearskin over thechildren tucked it under their feet and went out into the night to seeif the woman could be saved.He returned at dawn his efforts had been fruitless. The boy hadawakened at hearing Ursus and for the first time the latter saw hisface."What are you laughing at You are frightful Who did that to you" saidUrsus.The boy answered "I am not laughing. I have always been like this."Ursus turned away and muttered "I thought that sort of work was out ofdate." He took down an old book and read in Latin that by slitting themouth and performing other operations in childhood the face wouldbecome a mask whose owner would be always laughing.At that moment the infant awoke and Ursus gave it what was left of themilk.The baby girl was blind. Ursus had already decided that he and Homowould adopt the two children._II.--Gwynplaine and Dea_Gwynplaine was a mountebank. As soon as he exhibited himself all who sawhim laughed. His laugh created the laughter of others though he did notlaugh himself. It was his face only that laughed and laughed alwayswith an everlasting laugh.Fifteen years had passed since the night when the boy came to thecaravan at Weymouth and Gwynplaine was now twenty-five. Ursus had keptthe two children with him the blind girl he called Dea. The boy said hehad always been called Gwynplaine. Of course the two were in love.Gwynplaine adored Dea and Dea idolised Gwynplaine."You are beautiful" she would say to him. The crowd only saw his facefor Dea Gwynplaine was the person who had saved her from the tomb andwho was always kind and good-tempered. "The blind see the invisible"said Ursus.The old caravan had given way to a great van--called the GreenBox--drawn by a pair of stout horses. Gwynplaine had become famous. Inevery fair-ground the crowd ran after him.In 1705 the Green Box arrived in London and was established atSouthwark in the yard of the Tadcaster Inn. A placard was hung up withthe following inscription composed by Ursus"Here can be seen Gwynplaine deserted when he was ten years old onJanuary 29 1690 on the coast of Portland by the rascally
comment857,Comprachicos. The boy now grown up is known as 'The Man who Laughs.'"All Southwark came to see Gwynplaine and soon people heard of him onthe other side of London Bridge and crowds came from the City to theTadcaster Inn. It was not long before the fashionable world itself wasdrawn to the Laughing Man.One morning a constable and an officer of the High Court summonedGwynplaine to Southwark Gaol. Ursus watched him disappear behind theheavy door with a heavy heart.Gwynplaine was taken down flights of stairs and dark passages till hereached the torture-chamber. A man's body lay on the ground on its back.Its four limbs drawn to four columns by chains were in the position ofa St. Andrew's Cross. A plate of iron with five or six large stoneswas placed on the victim's chest. On a seat close by sat an old man--thesheriff of the county of Surrey."Come closer" said the sheriff to Gwynplaine. Then he addressed thewretched man on the floor who for four days in spite of torture hadkept silence."Speak unhappy man. Have pity on yourself. Do what is required of you.Open your eyes and see if you know this man."The prisoner saw Gwynplaine. Raising his head he looked at him and thencried out "That's him Yes--that's him""Registrar take down that statement" said the sheriff.The cry of the prisoner overwhelmed Gwynplaine. He was terrified by aconfession that was unintelligible to him and began in his distress tostammer and protest his innocence. "Have pity on me my lord. You havebefore you only a poor mountebank--""I have before me" said the sheriff "Lord Fermain Clancharlie BaronClancharlie and Hunkerville and a peer of England"Then the sheriff rising offered his seat with a bow to Gwynplainesaying "My lord will you please to be seated"_III.--The House of Lords_Before he left the prison the sheriff explained to Gwynplaine how it washe was Lord Clancharlie.The bottle containing the documents which had been thrown into the seain January 1690 had at last come to shore and had been duly received atthe Admiralty by a high official named Barkilphedro.This document declared that the child abandoned by those on the sinkingvessel was the only child of Lord Fermain Clancharlie deceased. At theage of two it had been sold disfigured and put out of the way by orderof King James II. Its parents were dead and a man named Hardquanonnenow in prison at Chatham had performed the mutilation and wouldrecognise the child who was called Gwynplaine. Being about to die thesignatories to the document confessed their guilt in abducting thechild and could not in the face of death refrain from acknowledgmentof their crime.The prisoner Hardquanonne had been found at Chatham and he hadrecognised Gwynplaine. Hardquanonne died of the tortures he hadsuffered but just before his death he said "I swore to keep thesecret and I have kept it as long as I could. We did it between us--theking and I. Silence is no longer any good. This is the man."What was the reason for the hatred of James II. to the childThis. Lord Clancharlie had taken the side of Cromwell against CharlesI. and had gone into exile in Switzerland rather than acknowledgeCharles II. as king. On the death of this nobleman James II. haddeclared his estates forfeit and the title extinct believing that theheir was lost beyond possible recovery. On David Dirry-Moir anillegitimate son of Lord Clancharlie were the peerage and estatesconferred on condition that he married a certain Duchess Josiana anillegitimate daughter of James II.How was it Gwynplaine was restored to his inheritance
comment858,Anne was Queen of England when the bottle was taken to the Admiralty in1705 and shared with the high official whose business it was to attendto all flotsam and jetsam a cordial dislike of Duchess Josiana. Itseemed to the Queen an excellent thing that Josiana should have to marrythis frightful man and as for David Dirry-Moir he could be made anadmiral. Anne consulted the Lord Chancellor privately and he stronglyadvised without blaming James II. that Gwynplaine must be restored tothe peerage.Gwynplaine without having time to return to the Green Box was carriedoff by Barkilphedro to one of his country houses near Windsor andbidden the next day take his seat in the House of Lords. He had enteredthe terrible prison in Southwark expecting the iron collar of a felonand he had placed on his head the coronet of a peer. Barkilphedro hadtold him that a man could not be made a peer without his own consentthat Gwynplaine the mountebank must make room for Lord Clancharlie ifthe peerage was accepted and he had made his decision.On awakening the next morning he thought of Dea. Then came a royalsummons to appear in the House of Lords and Gwynplaine returned toLondon in a carriage provided by the queen. The secret of his face wasstill unknown when he entered the House of Lords for the LordChancellor had not been informed of the nature of the deformation. Theinvestiture took place on the threshold of the House then very ill-litand two very old and half-blind noblemen acted as sponsors at the LordChancellor's request. The whole ceremony was enacted in a sort oftwilight for the Lord Chancellor was anxious to avoid any sensation.In less than half an hour the sitting was full. Gossip was already atwork about the new Lord Clancharlie. Several peers had seen the LaughingMan and they now heard that he was already in the Upper House but noone noticed him until he rose to speak.His face was terrible and the whole House looked with horror upon him."What does all this mean" cried the Earl of Wharton an old and muchrespected peer. "Who has brought this man into the House Who are youWhere do you come from"Gwynplaine answered "I come from the depths. I am misery. My lords Ihave a message for you."The House shuddered but listened and Gwynplaine continued."My lords among you I am called Lord Fermain Clancharlie but my realname is one of poverty--Gwynplaine. I have grown up in poverty frozenby winter and made wretched by hunger. Yesterday I was in the rags of aclown. Can you realise what misery means Before it is too late try andunderstand that our system of society is a false one."But the House rocked with uncontrollable laughter at the face ofGwynplaine. In vain he pleaded with those who sat around him not tolaugh at misery.They refused to listen and the sitting broke up in confusion the LordChancellor adjourning the House. Gwynplaine went out of the House alone._IV.--Night and the Sea_Ursus waited for some time after seeing Gwynplaine disappear withinSouthwark Gaol then he returned sadly to Tadcaster Inn. That very nightthe corpse of Hardquanonne was brought out from the gaol and buried in
comment859,the cemetery hard by and Ursus who had returned to the prison gatewatched the procession and saw the coffin carried to the grave."They have killed him Gwynplaine my son is dead" cried Ursus and heburst into tears.The following morning the sheriff's officer accompanied byBarkliphedro waited on Ursus and told him he must leave Southwark andleave England. The last hope in the soul of Ursus died when Barkilphedrosaid gravely that Gwynplaine was dead.Ursus bent his head.The sentence on Gwynplaine had been executed--death. His sentence waspronounced--exile. Nothing remained for Ursus but to obey. He felt as ifin a dream.Within two hours Ursus Homo and Dea were on board a Dutch vessel whichwas shortly to leave a wharf at London Bridge. The sheriff ordered theTadcaster Inn to be shut up.Gwynplaine found the vessel.He had left the House of Lords in despair. He had made his effort andthe result was derision. The future was terrible. Dea was his wife hehad lost her and he would be spurned by Josiana. He had lost Ursus andgained nothing but insult. Let David take the peerage he Gwynplainewould return to the Green Box. Why had he ever consented to be LordClancharlieHe wandered from Westminster to Southwark only to find the TadcasterInn shut up and the yard empty. It seemed he had lost Ursus and Dea forever. He turned and gazed into the deep waters by London Bridge. Theriver in its darkness offered a resting place where he might find peace.He got ready to mount the masonry and spring over when he felt a tonguelicking his hands. He turned and Homo was behind him. Gwynplaineuttered a cry. Homo wagged his tail. Then the wolf led the way down anarrow platform to the wharf and Gwynplaine followed him. On the vesselalongside the wharf was the old wooden tenement very worm-eaten androtten now in which Ursus lived when the boy first came to him atWeymouth. Gwynplaine listened. It was Ursus talking to Dea."Be calm my child. All will come right. You do not understand what itis to rupture a blood-vessel. You must rest. To-morrow we shall be atRotterdam.""Father" Dea answered "when two beings have always been together frominfancy and that state is disturbed death must come. I am not ill butI am going to die."She raised herself on the mattress crying in delirium "He is no longerhere no longer here. How dark it is" Gwynplaine came to her side andDea laid her hand on his head."Gwynplaine" she cried.And Gwynplaine received her in his arms."Yes it is I Gwynplaine. I am here. I hold you in my arms. Dea welive. All our troubles are over. Nothing can separate us now. We willrenew our old happy life. We are going to Holland. We will marry. Thereis nothing to fear.""I don't understand it in the least" said Ursus. "I who saw himcarried to the grave. I am as great a fool as if I were in love myself.But Gwynplaine be careful with her."The vessel started. They passed Chatham and the mouth of the Medway andapproached the sea.Suddenly Dea got up."Something's the matter with me" she said. "What is wrong You havebrought life to me my Gwynplaine life and joy. And yet I feel as if mysoul could not be contained in my body."She flushed then became very pale and fell. They lifted her up andDea laid her head on Gwynplaine's shoulder. Then with a sigh ofinexpressible sadness she said "I know what this is. I am dying." Hervoice grew weaker and weaker."An hour ago I wanted to die. Now I want to live. How happy we havebeen You will remember the old Green Box won't you and poor blindDea I love you all my father Ursus and my brother Homo very dearly.You are all so good. I do not understand what has happened these lasttwo days but now I am dying. Everything is fading away. Gwynplaine youwill think of me won't you Come to me as soon as you can. Do not leave
comment860,me alone long. Oh I cannot breathe My beloved"Gwynplaine pressed his mouth to her beautiful icy hands. For a moment itseemed as if she had ceased to breathe. Then her voice rang out clearly."Light" she cried. "I can see"With that Dea fell back stiff and motionless on the mattress."Dead" said Ursus.And the poor old philosopher crushed by his despair bowed his headand buried his face in the folds of the gown which covered Dea's feet.He lay there unconscious.Gwynplaine started up stretched his hands on high and said "I come."He strode across the deck towards the side of the vessel as ifbeckoned by a vision. A smile came upon his face such as Dea had justworn. One step more."I am coming Dea I am coming" he said.There was no bulwark the abyss of waters was before him he strode intoit and fell. The night was dark and heavy the water deep. Hedisappeared calmly and silently. None saw nor heard him. The ship sailedon and the river flowed out to the sea.                                   ELIZABETH INCHBALDA Simple Story     The maiden name of Mrs. Inchbald actress novelist     dramatist and society favourite was Elizabeth Simpson and     she was the daughter of a farmer living near Bury St. Edmunds     where she was born on October 15 1753. At the age of eighteen     she ran away to London under the influence of romantic     expectations which were realised by a sudden marriage with     Joseph Inchbald the actor. After seventeen years on the     stage without attaining conspicuous success Mrs. Inchbald     retired and devoted herself to the writing of novels and     plays and the collection of theatrical literature. Her first     novel written in 1791 was "A Simple Story." With "Nature and     Art" a tale written later it has kept a place among the     fiction that is reprinted for successive generations. In later     years Mrs. Inchbald lived quietly on her savings retaining a     flattering social position by her beauty and cleverness. She     died on August 1 1821._I.--The Priest's Ward_Dorriforth bred at St. Omer's in all the scholastic rigour of thatcollege was by education and the solemn vows of his order a RomanCatholic priest. He was about thirty and refusing to shelter himselffrom the temptations of the layman by the walls of a cloister butfinding that shelter in his own prudence justice fortitude andtemperance had lived in London near five years when a gentleman withwhom he had contracted a most sincere friendship died and left him thesole guardian of his daughter who was then eighteen.It is in this place proper to remark that Mr. Milner was a member of theChurch of Rome but his daughter had been educated in her dead mother'sreligion at a boarding-school for Protestants whence she had returnedwith her little heart employed in all the endless pursuits of personalaccomplishments and her mind left without one ornament except such asnature gave.She had been visiting at Bath when her father died. Therefore Mr.Dorriforth together with Miss Woodley the middle-aged niece of thewidow lady Mrs. Horton who kept his house journeyed midway to meether. But when the carriage stopped at the inn-gate and her name wasannounced he turned pale--something like a foreboding of disastertrembled at his heart--and Miss Woodley was obliged to be the first to
comment861,welcome his lovely charge--lovely beyond description.But the natural vivacity the gaiety which report had given to MissMilner were softened by her recent sorrow to a meek sadness. Theinstant Dorriforth was introduced to her as her "guardian and herdeceased father's most beloved friend" she burst into tears andkneeling before him promised ever to obey him as a father. She told himartlessly she had expected him to be elderly and plain. He was somewhatembarrassed but replied that she should find him a plain man in all hisactions and in the conversation which followed in which she hadsomewhat lightly referred to his faith begged that religion should notbe named between them for as he had resolved never to persecute herin pity she should be grateful and not persecute him.Among the many visitors who attended her leves during the followingweeks was Lord Frederick Lawnly whose intimacy with her Dorriforthbeheld with alternate pain and pleasure. He wished to see his chargemarried yet he trembled for her happiness under the care of a youngnobleman immersed in all the vices of the town. His uneasiness made himdesire her to forbid Lord Frederick's visits who alarmed confoundedand provoked remonstrated passionately."By heaven I believe Mr. Dorriforth loves you himself and it isjealousy which makes him treat me in this way""For shame my lord" cried Miss Woodley trembling with horror at thesacrilegious idea."Nay shame to him if he is not in love" answered his lordship. "Forwho but a savage could behold beauty like yours without owning itspower And surely when your guardian looks at you his wishes------""Are never less pure" Miss Milner replied eagerly "than those whichdwell in the bosom of my celestial guardian."At this moment Dorriforth entered the room."What's the matter" cried he looking with concern on his discomposure."A compliment paid by herself to you sir" replied Lord Frederick "hasaffected your ward in the manner you have seen." And then he changed thesubject with an air of ridicule while Miss Milner threw open the sashand leaned her head from the window to conceal the embarrassment hisimplication had caused her.Although Dorriforth was a good man there was an obstinacy in his naturewhich sometimes degenerated into implacable stubbornness. The child of asister once beloved who married a young officer against her brother'sconsent was left an orphan destitute of all support but from hisuncle's generosity but although Dorriforth maintained him he wouldnever see him. Miss Milner brought the boy to town once to present himto his uncle but no sooner did he hear Harry Rushbrook's name than heset him off his knee and calling for his hat walked instantly fromthe house although dinner had just been served.About this time Miss Milner had the humiliation of having Miss Fentonheld up to her as a pattern for her to follow but instead of beinginspired to emulation she was provoked to envy. Young beautifulelegant Miss Fenton was betrothed to Lord Elmwood Mr. Dorriforth'scousin and Dorriforth whose heart was not formed--at least noteducated--for love beheld in her the most perfect model for her sex.Not to admire Miss Fenton was impossible. To find one fault with her wasequally impossible and yet to love her was unlikely. But Mr. SandfordDorriforth's old tutor and rigid monitor and friend adored her andoften with a shake of his head and a sigh would he say to Miss Milner"No I am not so hard upon you as your guardian. I only desire you tolove Miss Fenton to resemble her I believe is above your ability."As a Jesuit he was a man of learning and knew the hearts of women aswell as those of men. He saw Miss Milner's heart at the first view ofher person and beholding in that little circumference a weight of follythat he wished to eradicate he began to toil in the vineyard eagerly
comment862,courting her detestation of him in the hope of also making her abominateherself. In the mortification of slights he was an expert and humbledher in her own opinion more than a thousand sermons would have done. Shewould have been cured of all her pride had she not possessed a degree ofspirit beyond the generality of her sex_II.--The Priest Marries His Ward_Finding Dorriforth frequently perplexed by his guardianship Mr.Sandford advised that a suitable match should immediately be sought forher but she refused so many offers that believing her affections wereset upon Lord Frederick he insisted that she should be taken into thecountry at once. Her ready compliance delighted Dorriforth and for sixweeks all around was the picture of tranquillity. Then Lord Fredericksuddenly appeared at the door as she alighted from her coach andseizing her hand entreated her "not to desert him in compliance withthe injunctions of monkish hypocrisy."Dorriforth heard this standing silently by with a manly scorn upon hiscountenance but on Miss Milner's struggling to release her hand whichLord Frederick was devouring with kisses with an instantaneous impulsehe rushed forward and struck him a violent blow in the face. Thenleading her to her own chamber covered with shame and confusion forwhat he had done he fell on his knees before her and earnestly"entreated her forgiveness for the indelicacy he had been guilty of inher presence."To see her guardian at her feet struck her with a sense of improprietyas if she had seen a parent there. All agitation and emotion sheimplored him to rise and with a thousand protestations declared "thatshe thought the rashness of his action was the highest proof of hisregard for her."Finding that Lord Frederick had gone when he had resigned the care ofhis ward to Miss Woodley Dorriforth returned to his own apartment witha bosom torn by excruciating sensations. He had departed from his sacredcharacter and the dignity of his profession and sentiments he hadtreated with unpardonable insult a young nobleman whose only offence waslove he had offended and filled with horror a beautiful young womanwhom it was his duty to protect from those brutal manners to which hehimself had exposed her.The outcome of this incident was a duel to prevent which Miss Milnerdeceived him by confessing a passion for Lord Frederick although toMiss Woodley she avowed the real truth that it was Dorriforth sheloved."Do you suppose I love Lord Frederick Do you suppose I _can_ love himOh fly and prevent my guardian from telling him this untruth Thisduel is horrible even beyond anything else Oh Miss Woodley pity theagonies of my heart my heart by nature sincere when such are the fatalpropensities it cherishes that I must submit to the grossest falsehoodsrather than reveal the truth Are you so blind" she exclaimed "as tobelieve I do not care for Mr. Dorriforth Oh Miss Woodley I love himwith all the passion of a woman and with all the tenderness of a wife""Silence" cried Miss Woodley struck with horror. Yet amidst all hergrief and abhorrence pity was still predominant and seeing herfriend's misery she did all she could to comfort her. But she wasresolved that she should leave home and on pain of revealing her
comment863,secret to Mr. Dorriforth induced her to pay a visit of indefinitelength to her friends at Bath.There in the melancholy that possessed her Miss Woodley's lettersalone gave her consolation. In a short time her health became impairedshe was once in imminent danger and during her delirium incessantlyrepeated her guardian's name. Miss Woodley journeyed to her at once andso did Dorriforth who through the death of his cousin Lord Elmwoodhad acquired his title and estates. On this account he had received adispensation from his vow of celibacy and was enjoined to marry. Hisward felt a pleasure so exquisite on hearing this that the agitation ofmind and person brought with it the sensation of exquisite pain but toher cruel grief she found that he was on the advice of his friendsalready paying his addresses to Miss Fenton.As if a poniard had thrust her to the heart she writhed under thisunexpected stroke she felt and she expressed anguish. Lord Elmwood wasalarmed and shocked. But later when in his perplexity concerning hisward's marriage he induced Miss Woodley to tell him on whom MissMilner's choice was fixed his vehemence filled her with alarm."For God's sake take care what you are doing You are destroying myprospects of futurity you are making this world too dear to me I amtransported by the tidings you have revealed--and yet perhaps I hadbetter not have heard them" he exclaimed. And then to prevent furtherquestion he hastened out of the room.Within a few days he was her professed lover--she the happiest of humanbeings--Miss Woodley partaking in the joy. Mr. Sandford alone lamentedwith the deepest concern that Miss Fenton had been supplanted--andsupplanted by Miss Milner.Yet Miss Fenton was perhaps affected least of any by the change shereceived everything with the same insipid smile of approbation and thesame cold indifference._III.--A Fatal Experiment_Lost in the maze of happiness that surrounded her Miss Milneroftentimes asked her heart "Are not my charms even more invincible thanI ever believed them to be Dorriforth the grave the pious theanchorite Dorriforth by their force is animated to all the ardour ofthe most impassioned lover while the proud priest the austere guardianis humbled if I but frown into the veriest slave of love." She thenasked "Why did I not keep him longer in suspense He could not haveloved me more I believe but my power over him might have been greaterstill. I am the happiest of women in the affection he has proved to me
comment864,but I wonder if it would exist under ill-treatment If it would not hestill does not love me as I wish to be loved if it would my triumphmy felicity would be enhanced."Thus the dear-bought experiment of being loved in spite of her faults--aglory proud women ever aspire to--was at present the ambition of MissMilner. She who as Dorriforth's ward had ever been gentle and alwaysobedient became as a mistress sometimes haughty always insolent. Hewas surprised but the novelty pleased him. Miss Milner whom hetenderly loved could put on no change that did not seem to become her.But at last her attempt to rouse his jealousy by again encouraging LordFrederick hurt him beyond measure. In a letter releasing her from herengagement to him and announcing his immediate departure for a longContinental tour he begged her for the short time they were to remaintogether not to insult him with an open preference for another. Bycomplying with this request she would give him to believe that shethought he had at least faithfully discharged some part of his duty.She was struck to despair. Pride alone kept her from revealing heranguish though her death should be the immediate consequence ButSandford who had hitherto been most inimical to her on the eveningbefore Lord Elmwood's departure showed at last some kindness byentreating her to breakfast with them the following morning. There shesat silent unable to eat unable to speak unable to move until themoment for parting came. Then unable to repress her tears asheretofore as Elmwood took her hand in his she suffered them to fallin torrents."What is all this" cried Sandford going up to them in anger.They neither of them replied or changed their situation."Separate this moment" cried Sandford. "Or resolve to be separated onlyby--death Lord Elmwood do you love this woman""More than my life" he replied with the most heartfelt accents.He then turned to Miss Milner."Can you say the same by him"She spread her hands over her eyes and exclaimed "Oh heavens""I believe you can say so" returned Sandford. "And in the name of Godand your own happiness since this is the state of you both let me putit out of your power to part"On which he opened his book and--married them.Nevertheless on that joyful day which restored her lost lover to herhopes again even on that very day after the ceremony was over MissMilner--with all the fears the superstition of her sex--felt anexcruciating shock when looking on the ring Lord Elmwood had put uponher finger in haste she perceived it was a mourning-ring._IV.--Outcasts_Alas in seventeen years the beautiful beloved Miss Milner was nolonger beautiful no longer beloved no longer virtuous.Dorriforth the pious the good the tender Dorriforth was become ahard-hearted tyrant.Miss Woodley had grown old but less with years than grief.The boy Harry Rushbrook had become a man and the apparent heir of LordElmwood's fortune while his own daughter his only child by hisonce-adored Miss Milner he refused ever to see again in vengeance toher mother's crime.Sandford alone remained much as heretofore.Lady Elmwood was a loved and loving bride seventeen years ago now shelay on her death-bed. At thirty-five "her course was run." After fouryears of perfect happiness Lord Elmwood was obliged to leave his wife
comment865,and child while he went to visit his large estates in the West Indies.His voyage was tedious his return delayed by serious illness which atoo cautious fear of her uneasiness prompted him to conceal. He was awaythree years.It was no other than Lord Frederick Lawnly to whom Lady Elmwoodsacrificed her own and her husband's future peace she did not howeverelope with her paramour but escaped to shelter herself in the mostdreary retreat where she partook of no comfort but the stillunremitting friendship of Miss Woodley. Even her child she left behindthat she might be under her father's protection. Conceive then howsharp her agony was on beholding the child sent after her as theperpetual outcast of its father. Lord Elmwood's love to his wife hadbeen extravagant--the effect of his hate was the same. Once more he metLord Frederick in a duel the effect of which was to leave his adversaryso defaced with scars as never again to endanger the honour of ahusband. He was himself dangerously wounded yet nothing but theassurance that his opponent was slain could tear him from the field.Now after ten years of exile the once gay volatile Miss Milner laydying with but one request to make--that her daughter should not sufferfor her sin. Sandford was with her by all the influence he ever hadover Lord Elmwood by his prayers by his tears he promised to implorehim to own his child. She could only smile her thanks but she wassufficiently sensible of his words to make a sign as if she wished toembrace him but finding life leaving her fast with a struggle sheclung to her child and died in her arms._V.--His Daughter's Happiness_Yet all that her mother's last appeal could obtain for the haplessMatilda not as her child but as the granddaughter of Mr. Milner wasthe shelter of her father's roof on condition that she avoided hissight. When by accident or design he ever saw or heard from her thatmoment his compliance with her mother's request ceased and he abandonedher once more. Still the joy of being even in so remote a way underher father's care was extreme for her though it was tempered withjealousy of Rushbrook--a feeling which even her noble heart could notcompletely quell--jealousy which was shared on her account by both MissWoodley and Mr. Sandford and frequently made them unjust to Harry whomthey regarded as an interloper.But his passionate gratitude to Lady Elmwood by whose entreaties he hadbeen restored to his uncle's favour had made him adore her daughterwith an equal passion. He gazed with wonder at his uncle's insensibilityto his own happiness and would gladly have led him to the jewel he castaway though even his own expulsion should be the fatal consequence.At last by accident Lord Elmwood returned unexpectedly home whenMatilda was descending the staircase and in her affright she fell
comment866,motionless into her father's arms. He caught her as by the same impulsehe would have caught anyone falling for want of aid. Yet when he foundher in his arms he still held her there--gazed on her attentively--andpressed her to his bosom.At length trying to escape the snare into which he had been led he wasgoing to leave her on the spot where she fell when her eyes opened andshe uttered "Save me" Her voice unmanned him. His long-restrainingtears now burst forth and seeing her relapsing into the swoon hecalled out eagerly to recall her. Her name did not however come to hisrecollection--nor any name but this--"Miss Milner dear Miss Milner."The sound did not awaken her and now again he wished to leave her inthis senseless state that not remembering what had passed she mightescape the punishment.But at this instant his steward passed and into his hands he deliveredhis apparently dead child his face agitated with shame with pity withanger with paternal tenderness. On her recovery she was sent to aneighbouring farm not more than thirty miles away her father havinggiven orders that it should be so.Then a libertine lover of Lady Matilda's finding her no longer underher father's protection resolved to abduct her and by raising an alarmof fire caused all the inhabitants of the farmhouse to open the doorswhen two men rushed in and with the plea of saving her from theflames carried her away. News of this being taken to her father he atonce set out in pursuit and reached her in her last agony of despairfolding her in his arms with the unrestrained fondness of a parent.It was now the middle of November and yet as Matilda passed alongnever to her did the sun shine so bright as upon this morning never didher imagination comprehend that the human heart could feel happinesstrue and genuine as hersRushbrook had been detained at Elmwood during all this time more fromthe persuasions nay prayers of Sandford than the commands of LordElmwood. His uncle's summons for him to join them in town wastherefore received with delight. Yet his joy was tempered by finding
comment867,that it was to propose a matrimonial alliance that his uncle had sentfor him after a thousand fears much confusion and embarrassment heat length frankly confessed his "heart was engaged and had been solong before his uncle offered to direct his choice."On hearing on whom he had set his affections Lord Elmwood immediatelyleft the room for the apartment where Sandford Miss Woodley andMatilda were sitting and cried with an angry voice and with hiscountenance disordered "Rushbrook has offended me beyond pardon. GoSandford and tell him this instant to quit my house and never dare toreturn."But Matilda impeded him and throwing her arms about his neck cried"Dear Mr. Sandford do not""How" exclaimed her father.She saw the impending frown and knelt at his feet."Do you know what he has asked of me" he asked."No" she replied with the utmost innocence "but whatever it is mylord though you do not grant it yet pardon him for asking.""Perhaps you would grant him what he has requested" said her father."Most willingly were it in my gift.""It is" replied he. "Go to him in the library and hear what he has tosay for on your will his fate shall depend."Like lightning she flew out of the room while even the grave Sandfordsmiled at the idea of their meeting. And whether the heart of Matildacould sentence Rushbrook to misery the reader is left to surmise and ifhe supposes that it could _not_ he has every reason to suppose thattheir wedded life was--a life of happiness.                                   G.P.R. JAMESHenry Masterton     The son of a physician George Payne Rainsford James was born     in London on August 9 1799. He began to write early and     according to his own account the volume of short stories     published under the title of "A String of Pearls" was written     before he was seventeen. As a contributor to the magazines and     newspapers his name came under the notice of Washington     Irving who encouraged him to produce in 1823 his "Life of     Edward the Black Prince." "Richelieu" his first novel     brought him warm praises from Sir Walter Scott and thus     fortified James who had had ambitions for a political life     determined to continue his career as a novelist. His output of     fiction was amazing--he was the author of upwards of a hundred     novels. Of all his works perhaps his most characteristic is     "Henry Masterton" which appeared in 1832. More solid and less     melodramatic than his other stories it abounds in picturesque     scenes and has that pleasant spice of adventure that makes     for good romance. He died on June 9 1860._I.--When Charles the First Was King_In the earlier years of the reign of King Charles I. when already therewere signs of those disorders which were the prelude to the GreatRebellion one of the most prominent gentlemen at his majesty's courtwas a certain Lord Langleigh.Bold and rash in the extreme Lord Langleigh though no man could doubthis whole-hearted devotion to his majesty fell under the suspicion ofthe king's councillors. These suspicions were given a form and directionby Lord Ashkirk an impoverished nobleman who secretly lodged certaincharges of treason against Lord Langleigh and obtained as the price ofthis betrayal the wealth and the estate of Penford-bourne that hadbelonged to his victim.Tried by his peers and found guilty on false evidence Lord Langleighawaited his death upon the scaffold in the prison-house of the Tower.While expecting his fate he sent for his great friend Lord Mastertonof Masterton House Devonshire to settle with him such details as werenecessary for the future welfare of his motherless daughter. LordMasterton immediately hastened to London and exerted all his influencein an endeavour to secure a pardon for his friend. But his efforts were
comment868,in vain. At a last interview he promised to undertake the charge ofLord Landleigh's infant daughter Emily and voluntarily pledged himselfto see her married to his eldest son.Then on the morning of the execution Langleigh contrived to escapefrom the Tower.In the company of the captain of the Tower guard he reached a ship boundfor the continent. The vessel was beset by a storm and the only one ofits occupants that was able to tell the tale of the terrible disasterwas the captain of the guard who after exonerating everyone from ashare in his prisoner's escape died from exhaustion.Meanwhile Lord Ashkirk had secured the price of his treason and was inthe full enjoyment of the estates of Penford-bourne. Not even certaindomestic troubles that occurred regarding the marriage of his daughterLady Eleanor disturbed the serenity of his content. Before hisaccession to the property of Lord Langleigh Lord Ashkirk had betrothedhis daughter to his nephew Walter Dixon the son of a wealthy attorneywho had married the peer's sister. The arrival of two Popish gentlemenSir Andrew Fleming and M. du Tillet caused him to alter his decision.Sir Andrew fell in love with the wonderful beauty of Lady Eleanor andeasily persuaded Lord Ashkirk himself a Cavalier and a papist tocancel the marriage with Walter Dixon who had joined the Parliamentaryparty. Lady Eleanor was duly united to Sir Andrew and Walter Dixondeprived of his bride and the succession to the Penford-bourne estatedetermined to be revenged.He found a means ready to his hand. Lady Eleanor pretended no affectionfor her husband and took a special delight in exciting his angryjealousy. She accepted Du Tillet as a lover and when Dixon wounded ina duel with her husband was carried into the house she nursed him withso much apparent affection and attention that her husband's wrath passedall bounds. A separation became necessary and Sir Andrew Flemingconsented to leave the woman whose love he could not win.Walter Dixon so far satisfied was yet determined to exact his fulltale of vengeance and secure the rich lands and estates ofPenford-bourne. The death of Lord Ashkirk and the successful growth ofthe Parliamentary party appeared to give him the opportunity he soeagerly desired._II.--A Web of Intrigue_At Masterton House in Devonshire Lord Masterton remained inretirement though the Parliamentary party carried all before them. Hewould doubtless have continued to refrain from drawing his sword onbehalf of his king who had wronged and insulted him had notcircumstances forced his hand.His tenantry were secretly armed and drilled and under the command of
comment869,Frank were marched eastwards to Kent to join Lord Norwich and Haleswho were preparing a rising to rescue the king.Frank before leaving Masterton House bade farewell to Lady Emily withthat cold reserve and studied formality which was part of his character.The fact that she was betrothed to him by the commands of his father hadfailed to arose any passion in his breast. He was prepared however tofulfil the commands of Lord Masterton though his heart was untouched.But the parting between his brother and Lady Emily was of a differentcharacter. Though out of loyalty to his brother no word of love had everpassed his lips Henry was passionately devoted to the beautiful girlwho had grown up with him under his father's roof. And there was nodoubt as to which of the brothers it was to whom Lady Emily had givenher affections.The arrival of the little force in Kent brought the two brothers intothe web of intrigue which was being spun by Walter Dixon. It was Dixon'sobject to prevent the union of Frank's forces with Lord Norwich. He hadbeen promised the estates of Penford-bourne should he succeed in hisobject and prove Lady Eleanor a malignant. In pursuance of this plan heallowed himself to be taken prisoner by Henry Masterton to whom hedeclared that he was really a Royalist in disguise.His next step was to obtain for the brothers an invitation from LadyEleanor to quarter themselves at Penford-bourne. Once he had settledthem there he obtained through Frank Masterton's valet a puritanicalknave called Gabriel Jones complete information as to their planswhich he was thus able to thwart.At Penford-bourne Frank came under the spell of Lady Eleanor's beautyall his duties were forgotten and he lingered on by the side of thewoman he loved. In vain Henry protested against his dereliction of duty.Frank refused to move and it was not until his brother came in touchwith Lord Norwich that circumstances compelled him to act. Lord Norwichwas furious at Frank's conduct."I will give your brother one chance" he said to Henry. "If he refusesthat chance I shall supersede him and name you to the command. Here isthe commission. If you succeed in persuading him to join me at once youmay burn it if not you must take the command and march immediately."Sadly Henry returned to Penford-bourne. On the way he overheard aconversation between Walter Dixon and Gabriel Jones which made it clearthat they were privy to a plot having for its object the ruin of FrankMasterton. He at once placed them both under arrest and hastened to hisbrother's side. Frank obstinately determined not to move. Only theintervention of Lady Eleanor induced him to promise to set out the nextday.But on the morrow Frank had an affair of honour with a mysterious man inblack with whom he had quarrelled the night before.Henry found him bleeding from two severe wounds and then having issuedinstructions for him to be removed to the house rejoined his regimentand at once gave the order to march.He reached Lord Norwich to find all his trouble in vain. Disaster haddissolved the forces of the Cavaliers and Lord Norwich had reluctantlydecided to abandon the attempt and disbanding his men made the bestof his way into Essex. In the excitement of these events Walter Dixoneffected his escape.On his way back to Penford-bourne Henry learned that Lady Eleanor'shusband was still alive. He at once used this information to induceFrank to leave the side of Lady Eleanor and in spite of his wounds toaccompany him back to Devonshire. As the lovers parted Henry overheardtheir last words."Then I rely on you" said Frank in a hasty voice. "You will notsurely you will not fail me"
comment870,"By all I hold dear on earth and beyond the earth" she replied in lowthrilling tones._III.--Days of Gloom_To Lord Masterton Frank related the story of how he had been wounded inthe early part of the campaign and had been compelled to hand over thecommand of his regiment to his brother. This piece of fiction set allawkward questions at rest and the old lord satisfied that his son andheir had covered himself with honour hastened to arrange for hisnuptials with Lady Emily.Both to Henry and to the girl these were days of gloom but Frank onthe other hand was strangely happy and content. His passion for LadyEleanor was still unabated and though to gratify his father he hadconsented to marry Lady Emily he had already taken such steps toprevent their union as would leave his share in the matter undiscovered.Dixon though he had carried out his part of the bargain had beendisgusted to discover that the Council of State on some speciousexcuse refused to grant him the estates of Penford-bourne.The day of the wedding arrived. By some secret arrangement with theofficiating clergyman the service was unduly protracted. But at lastthose words were reached which if uttered would make Frank and LadyEmily one. Then suddenly armed men burst into the chapel and readingtheir warrant demanded the arrest of Frank Masterton as a malignantlately in arms in Kent. The bridegroom offered no resistance. But it wasdifferent with Lord Masterton. He boldly called upon the guests presentto draw their swords. A scuffle took place. Suddenly from the galleryabove the voice of Gabriel Jones gave the order to fire. A volley rangout and Lord Masterton fell dead at the feet of his son.In the confusion Henry seized Lady Emily and shooting down GabrielJones escaped through a secret passage into the grounds. There he layhidden for some days and then when the coast was clear secured apassage in a smuggling ship for himself and Lady Emily and her auntLady Margaret. Arrived in France he placed the ladies in a convent atDinan and made his way to England again under an assumed name as acommercial traveller for a French house to learn the fate of hisbrother.Arrived in London he obtained some news of his brother from a goldsmithwho had acted as the family banker for years past. Through theassistance of Lady Eleanor Frank Masterton had been set at liberty andhad taken his departure in the company of that lady to Paris. ThitherHenry determined to follow them.Before setting out he paid a business call at a merchant's house wherehe found a man of distinguished appearance whom he discovered to beGeneral Ireton. Hearing that Henry was bound for France Ireton askedhim whether he would deliver a letter for him to General St. Maur. Itwas a most important communication he declared insomuch as it was thepayment of a debt to a man to whom he owed much.Warned by a footstep on the stairs Ireton requested Henry to retireinto the adjoining room as he had some business to transact. Throughthe door Henry heard the well-known voice of General Dixon. He wascomplaining bitterly that Ireton had not carried out his promise andhanded him over the estates of Penford-bourne."We have no excuse for sequestrating the estates" replied Ireton.
comment871,Walter Dixon was furious declared that he had been made a tool of andthreatening Ireton announced his intention of going to France. As soonas he had taken his departure Henry was summoned from the other roomand being bidden to hold his tongue if he had heard anything wasinformed by Ireton that he would visit him that night with the packagehe had requested him to deliver to General St. Maur.Some hours later when it was dark Henry received his visitor but theunexpected arrival of the goldsmith who addressed Henry by his realname disclosed his identity. Finding however that he intended him noill Ireton questioned him closely as to what had brought him to London."To see whether I might not render some aid to my brother" Henryreplied "after having placed the Lady Emily in safety.""She was never in danger" replied Ireton quietly. "I would take goodcare of that. I will still trust you with my commission. The time maycome when you will thank me for so doing."With that he turned and left the room._IV.--The Mysterious Monk_Chance ordained it that Henry Masterton should cross the Channel on thesame boat which was carrying General Dixon to France. The latter withwhat General Ireton had called "his blunt hypocrisy" frankly related toHenry the motives that had influenced him in the part that he hadplayed.Arrived at Calais the two men journeyed some part of the way togetherand before they separated Henry discovered something of the realcharacter of his companion by his familiarity with certain broken-downCavaliers who having lost all right to the title of gentlemen in theirown country eked out a living by brigandage in France. After they hadseparated Henry lost his way and arriving at night drenched throughwith the rain at a certain chateau begged its hospitality for a night.He was led into the dining-room and introduced to another guest who wasthere--a Benedictine monk.That night while Henry lay in bed he was startled to see the monkstanding by his side. He had come he said to ask him severalquestions. In particular he wished to know whether his brother Frank hadmarried Lady Emily Langleigh. When Henry related how the marriage hadbeen prevented the Benedictine suddenly sprang to his feet in a fury ofrage. When calmer he asked Henry whether Frank had come to Francealone but on this subject the young man preserved a discreet silenceand after a few more questions which proved the monk's extraordinaryfamiliarity with all Walter Dixon's intrigues at Penford-bourne he leftthe room.The following day Henry bade farewell to his courteous host and madehis way to Dinan. There he found that the convent in which he had leftthe two ladies had been burnt down and he learnt that a strangegentleman had called before this disaster and had taken Lady Emily andLady Margaret away.Bitterly disappointed Henry made his way to Paris where he found thecity in the throes of a civil war. Becoming unintentionally mixed up in
comment872,a petty skirmish between the court party and the Frondes he was badlywounded and narrowly escaped hanging as an enemy of the Frondeurs.Meanwhile Frank Masterton or Lord Masterton as he now was was livingwhat he had fondly imagined would be the ideal life with the girl heloved but already he found it an illusion. His loss of honour hisconsciousness that his conduct was discreditable plunged him intobitter fits of remorse from which he vainly sought relief by a round ofgaiety. Lady Eleanor saw these signs with terror and despair. Though shehad accomplished her desire her life was unbearable daily she grewmore miserable. At last she determined to end her earthly sufferings. Inher chamber she swallowed the fatal dose of poison with which againstsuch a day she had provided herself.As she lay in the throes of death it chanced that Henry Mastertonarrived having at length found his brother's place of residence. Henryat once did everything possible to save Lady Eleanor's life but seeingthat the dark shadow deepened every moment he hastened to fetch apriest.In the street he came upon the Benedictine talking to Walter Dixon andbidding him follow led him to the bedside of Lady Eleanor and left himalone with the dying woman.Bending over her the monk solemnly asked her if she had anything on hermind which she wished to confess.He pressed a cup to her lips and in a slow gasping voice she laid barethe story of her life and then went on to relate her feelings at herfirst meeting with Frank Masterton."When we parted and I thought of the man to whom I was bound for lifewhat fearful feelings came across my bosom Sir Andrew Fleming myhusband Was it possible I called to remembrance his look hisharshness his jealousy and oh God oh God how I did hate thatman""Woman woman" exclaimed the monk rising up from his seat and castingback the cowl from his head "Oh God oh God how I did love you"Lady Eleanor's eyes fixed full upon his face. Before her stood in thegarb of a Benedictine monk Sir Andrew Fleming her husband. For asecond she looked at him imploringly then with fearful strength sherose from her recumbent position and clasping her hands as if in theact of prayer sank down upon her knees at his feet. A low moan escapedfrom her lips. She fell forward on the ground and the spirit departedfor ever from its clay.The monk grasped his forehead with his hand gazing at her with mingledfeelings of love anger sorrow and despair then raising the body inhis arms he placed it on the couch and bending over it three timesprinted a long kiss upon the pale lips. Then with his right hand thrustinto his robe he rushed out of the room.Outside in the hall there came towards him Lord Masterton GeneralDixon and Henry. A look of deadly concentrated hate came into SirAndrew Fleming's eyes. For a moment he paused then drawing a daggerfrom his bosom he flung himself on Lord Masterton and with one blowstretched him dead at his feet."Villain" cried Walter Dixon. "Atrocious villain"With the rapidity of lightning he drew his sword and at once passed itthrough the body of the assassin.To Walter Dixon this scene of carnage which he had planned withelaborate care seemed to ensure his long delayed possession of thePenford-bourne estates. Lady Eleanor was dead her husband Sir Andrewhad fallen by his hand and there were no lives now between him and hisrightful possession of the property. But once more he was doomed todisappointment.As soon as he had an opportunity Henry sought out General St. Maur and
comment873,handed him the package he had received from Ireton. The general pressedhim to stay to dinner and while the meal progressed extracted from himsomething of his story. When the meal was nearly over the door suddenlyopened and a dog rushed to him barking joyously. It was his owndog--the dog he had brought with him from Masterton House and left withLady Emily How had it come there Amazed he was about to ask for anexplanation when Lady Emily herself stood before him. In another momentthe lovers were in one another's arms.Henry astonished as he was at these events was still more surprisedwhen he learnt that General St. Maur was really Lord Langleigh thefather of Emily. He had not as all the world had thought been drownedin his escape from the Tower. In the wreck he had succeeded in savingnot only his own life but the life of a young man named Ireton. Iretonhad never forgotten the debt and now in the package which Henry hadbrought over from England had endeavoured to repay it. He had persuadedthe Council that the estates of Penford-bourne had been improperlysequestrated by King Charles and should be returned to their lawfulowner Lord Langleigh and the letter contained a decree of the Councilonce more granting him his lands and title.When Walter Dixon heard of these events which again snatched the prizefor which he had attempted so much from his lips he determined on yetanother effort to achieve his object. Bribing two men to assist him inthe deed he lured Lord Langleigh into an ambush. Only the promptarrival of Henry Masterton prevented the success of this foul deed andit was Dixon himself who fell a victim.Lord Langleigh too good a Cavalier courteously refused the offers ofthe Council of State and remained in France until the Restorationwhen with Henry now Lord Masterton and his wife Lady Emily hereturned to Penford-bourne to spend the remainder of his days in hisnative land.                                   SAMUEL JOHNSONRasselas Prince of Abyssinia     Samuel Johnson was born at Lichfield in Staffordshire on     September 18 1709 and died in London December 13 1784. In     Volume IX of THE WORLD'S GREATEST BOOKS appears an epitome of     Boswell's famous "Life of Johnson." "The History of Rasselas     Prince of Abyssinia" was written by Dr. Johnson in order to     meet the expenses incurred by his mother's illness and death.     According to Boswell the work was composed in the evenings of     one week and the sheets sent to the printers exactly as they
comment874,     left his hands without even being read over by the author     himself. It was published during the early part of 1759     Johnson receiving for it the sum of 100 and a further amount     of 25 when it came to a second edition. Of all Johnson's     works "Rasselas" was apparently the most popular. By 1775 it     reached its fifth edition and has since been translated into     many languages. The work is more of a satire on optimism and     on human life in general than a novel and perhaps is little     more than a ponderous dissertation on Johnson's favourite     theme the "vanity of human wishes." As to its actual merits     Johnson's contemporaries differed widely some proclaiming him     a pompous pedant with a passion for words of six syllables and     more others delighting in those passages in which weighty     meaning was illustrated with splendour and vigour._I.--Life in the Happy Valley_Rasselas was the fourth son of the mighty emperor in whose dominions thefather of waters begins his course whose bounty pours down the streamsof plenty and scatters over the world the harvests of Egypt.According to the custom which has descended from age to age among themonarchs of the torrid zone the prince was confined in a privatepalace with the other sons and daughters of Abyssinian royalty tillthe order of succession should call him to the throne.The place which the wisdom or policy of antiquity had designed for theresidence of the princes was a spacious valley in the kingdom of Amharasurrounded on every side by mountains of which the summits overhang themiddle part. The only passage by which it could be entered was a cavernthat passed under a rock of which it had long been disputed whether itwas the work of nature or of human industry. The outlet of the cavernwas concealed by a thick wood and the mouth which opened into thevalley was closed with gates of iron forged by the artificers ofancient days so massive that no man without the help of engines couldopen or shut them.From the mountains on every side rivulets descended that filled all thevalley with verdure and fertility and formed a lake in the middleinhabited by fish of every species and frequented by every fowl whomnature has taught to dip the wing in water.The valley wide and fruitful supplied its inhabitants with all thenecessaries of life and all delights and superfluities were added atthe annual visit which the emperor paid his children when the iron gatewas opened to the sound of music and during eight days every one thatresided in the valley was required to propose whatever might contributeto make seclusion pleasant to fill up the vacancies of attention andto lessen the tediousness of time. Every desire was immediatelygratified. Such was the appearance of security and delight which thisretirement afforded that they to whom it was new always desired that itmight be perpetual and as those on whom the iron gate had once closedwere never suffered to return the effect of longer experience could notbe known.Here the sons and daughters of Abyssinia lived only to know the softvicissitudes of pleasure and repose. The sages who instructed them toldthem of nothing but the miseries of public life and described allbeyond the mountains as regions of calamity where discord was alwaysraging and where man preyed upon man. These methods were generallysuccessful. Few of the princes had ever wished to enlarge their boundsthey rose in the morning and lay down at night pleased with each otherand with themselves. All but Rasselas who in the twenty-sixth year of
comment875,his age began to withdraw himself from the pastimes and assemblies andto delight in solitary walks and silent meditation. His attendantsobserved the change and endeavoured to renew his love of pleasure buthe neglected their officiousness and repulsed their invitations.One day his old instructor began to lament the change which had beenlately observed in him and to inquire why he so often retired from thepleasures of the palace to loneliness and silence."I fly from pleasure" said the prince "because pleasure has ceased toplease. I am lonely because I am miserable and am unwilling to cloudwith my presence the happiness of others.""You sir" said the sage "are the first who has complained of miseryin the Happy Valley. I hope to convince you that your complaints have noreal cause. Look round and tell me which of your wants is withoutsupply. If you want nothing how are you unhappy""That I want nothing" said the prince "or that I know not what I wantis the cause of my complaint. If I had only known a want I should havea certain wish and that wish would excite endeavour for itssatisfaction. I have already enjoyed too much. Give me something todesire.""Sir" said the old man "if you had seen the miseries of the world youwould know how to value your present state.""Now" said the prince "you have given me something to desire. I shalllong to see the miseries of the world since the sight of them isnecessary to happiness."_II.--The Escape Into the Outer World_The stimulus of this new desire--the desire of seeing the world--soonhad its effect in making Rasselas no longer gloomy and unsociable.Considering himself as master of a secret stock of happiness heaffected to be busy in all the assemblies and schemes of diversionbecause he supposed the frequency of his presence necessary to thesuccess of his purposes. He retired gladly to privacy because inpicturing to himself that world which he had never seen he had now asubject of thought.Thus passed twenty months of his life he busied himself so intensely invisionary bustle that he forgot his real solitude. But one day theconsciousness of his own folly and inaction pierced him deeply. He
comment876,compared twenty months with the life of man. "The period of humanexistence" said he "may be reasonably estimated at forty years ofwhich I have mused away the four-and-twentieth part."These sorrowful meditations fastened upon his mind he passed fourmonths in resolving to lose no more time in idle resolves. Thenawakening to more vigorous exertion he for a few hours regretted hisregret and from that time bent his whole mind upon the means ofescaping from the Valley of Happiness.He now found that it would be very difficult to effect that which it wasvery easy to suppose effected. He passed week after week in clamberingthe mountains but found all the summits inaccessible by theirprominence. The iron gate was not only secured with all the power ofart but was always watched by successive sentinels. In these fruitlessresearches he spent ten months. The time however passed cheerfullyaway for he met a thousand amusements which beguiled his labour anddiversified his thought.A little while afterwards he began to cherish hopes of escaping from thevalley by quite a different way. Among the artists allowed there tolabour for the accommodation and pleasure of its inhabitants was a maneminent for his knowledge of the mechanic powers who had contrived manyengines both of use and recreation. He interested the prince in aproject of flying and undertook to construct a pair of wings in whichhe would himself attempt an aerial flight. But alas when in a year'stime the wings were ready and their contriver waved them and leapedfrom the little promontory on which he had taken his stand he merelydropped into the lake his wings only serving to sustain him in thewater.The prince was not much afflicted by this disaster and he soon forgotany disappointment he had felt in the society and conversation of a newartist--a poet called Imlac--who delighted him by the narrative of histravels and dealings with men in various parts of Africa and Asia."Hast thou here found happiness at last" asked Rasselas. "Tell mewithout reserve art thou content with thy condition or dost thou wishto be again wandering and inquiring All the inhabitants of this valleycelebrate their lot and at the annual visit of the emperor inviteothers to partake of their felicity. Is this felicity genuine orfeigned""Great prince" said Imlac "I shall speak the truth. I know not one ofall your attendants who does not lament the hour when he entered thisretreat. I am less unhappy than the rest because I have a mind repletewith images which I can vary and combine at pleasure. The rest whoseminds have no impression but the present moment are either corroded bymalignant passions or sit steeped in the gloom of perpetual vacancy.""What passions can infect those" said the prince "who have no rivals
comment877,We are in a place where impotence precludes malice and where all envyis repressed by community of enjoyments.""There may be community of material possessions" said Imlac "but therecan never be community of love or of esteem. It must happen that onewill please more than another. He that knows himself despised willalways be envious and still more envious and malevolent if he iscondemned to live in the presence of those who despise him. Theinvitations by which the inhabitants of the valley allure others to astate which they feel to be wretched proceed from the natural malignityof hopeless misery. I look with pity on the crowds who are annuallysoliciting admission to captivity and wish that it were lawful for meto warn them of their danger."Upon this hint Rasselas opened his whole heart to Imlac who promisingto assist him to escape proposed the plan of piercing the mountain. Asuitable cavern having been found the two men worked arduously at theirtask and within a few days had accomplished it. A few more days passedand Rasselas and Imlac with the prince's sister Nekayah had gone byship to Suez and thence to Cairo._III.--The Search for Happiness_The prince and princess who carried with them jewels sufficient to makethem rich in any place of commerce gradually succeeded in mixing in thesociety of the city and for some time the former who had been wont toponder over what _choice of life_ he should make thought choiceneedless because all appeared to him really happy.Imlac was unwilling to crush the hope of inexperience. Till one dayhaving sat awhile silent "I know not" said Rasselas "what can be thereason that I am more unhappy than any of my friends. I see themperpetually and unalterably cheerful but feel my own mind restless anduneasy. I am unsatisfied with those pleasures which I seem most tocourt. I live in the crowds of jollity not so much to enjoy company asto shun myself and am only loud and merry to conceal my sadness.""Every man" said Imlac "may by examining his own mind guess whatpasses in the minds of others. When you feel that your own gaiety iscounterfeit it may justly lead you to suspect that of your companionsnot to be sincere. Envy is commonly reciprocal. We are long before weare convinced that happiness is never to be found and each believes itto be possessed by others to keep alive the hope of obtaining it forhimself.""This" said the prince "may be true of others since it is true of meyet whatever be the general infelicity of man one condition is morehappy than another and wisdom surely directs us to take the least evil
comment878,in the _choice of life_.""Very few" said the poet "live by choice. Every man is placed in thepresent condition by causes which acted without his foresight and withwhich he did not always willingly co-operate and therefore you willrarely meet one who does not think the lot of his neighbour better thanhis own."Rasselas resolved however to continue his experiments on life. As hewas one day walking in the street he saw a spacious building which allwere by the open doors invited to enter. He found it a hall ofdeclamation and listened to a sage who discoursed with great energy onthe conquest of the passions and displayed the happiness of those whohad obtained this important victory after which man is no longer theslave of fear nor the fool of hope is no more emaciated by envyinflamed by anger emasculated by tenderness or depressed by grief.Receiving permission to visit this philosopher--having indeedpurchased it by presenting him with a purse of gold--Rasselas returnedhome with joy to Imlac."I have found" said he "a man who from the unshaken throne ofrational fortitude looks down on the scenes of life changing beneathhim. I will learn his doctrines and imitate his life.""Be not too hasty" said Imlac "to trust or to admire the teachers ofmorality they discourse like angels but they live like men."Imlac's caution turned out to be wise for when the prince paid hisvisit a few days afterwards he found the philosopher weeping over thedeath of his only daughter and refusing to be comforted by any of theconsolations that truth and reason could afford.Still eager upon the same inquiry and resolving to discover whetherthat felicity which public life could not afford was to be found insolitude Rasselas determined to visit a hermit who lived near thelowest cataract of the Nile and filled the whole country with the fameof his sanctity Imlac and the princess agreeing to accompany him. Onthe third day they reached the cell of the holy man who was desired togive his direction as to a choice of life."He will most certainly remove from evil" said the prince "who shalldevote himself to that solitude which you have recommended by yourexample.""I have no desire that my example should gain any imitators" repliedthe hermit. "In my youth I professed arms and was raised by degrees tothe highest military rank. At last being disgusted by the prefermentsof a younger officer I resolved to close my life in peace having foundthe world full of snares discord and misery. For some time after myretreat I rejoiced like a tempest-beaten sailor at his entrance into the
comment879,harbour. When the pleasure of novelty went away I employed my hours inexamining the plants and minerals of the place. But that inquiry is nowgrown tasteless and irksome and I have been for some time unsettled anddistracted. I am sometimes ashamed to think that I could not securemyself from vice but by retiring from the exercise of virtue and beginto suspect that I was rather impelled by resentment than led by devotioninto solitude. I have been long comparing the evils with the advantagesof society and resolve to return into the world to-morrow."They accompanied him back to the city on which as he approached it hegazed with rapture.A day or two later Rasselas was relating his interview with the hermitat an assembly of learned men who met at stated intervals to comparetheir opinions."The way to be happy" said one of them "is to live according tonature in obedience to that universal and unalterable law with whichevery heart is originally impressed which is not written on it byprecept but engraven by design not instilled by education but infusedat our nativity."When he had spoken he looked round him with a placid air and enjoyedthe consciousness of his own beneficence."Sir" said the prince with great modesty "as I like all the rest ofmankind am desirous of felicity my closest attention has been fixedupon your discourse. I doubt not the truth of a position which solearned a man has so confidently advanced. Let me only know what it isto live according to nature.""When I find young men so humble and so docile" said the philosopher"I can deny them no information which my studies have enabled me toafford. To live according to nature is to act always with due regard tothe fitness arising from the relations and qualities of causes andeffects to concur with the great and unchangeable scheme of universalfelicity to co-operate with the general disposition and tendency of thepresent system of things."The prince soon found that this was a sage whom he should understandless as he heard him longer. He therefore bowed and was silent and thephilosopher supposing him satisfied departed with the air of a man whohad co-operated with the present system._IV.--Happiness They Find Not_Rasselas returned home full of reflections and finding that Imlacseemed to discourage a continuance of the search began _to_ discoursemore freely with his sister who had yet the same hope with himself."We will divide the task between us" said she. "You shall try what is
comment880,to be found in the splendour of courts and I will range the shades ofhumbler life."Accordingly the prince appeared next day with a splendid retinue atthe court of the bassa. But he soon found that the lives of courtiersare a continual succession of plots and detections stratagems andescapes faction and treachery. Many of those who surrounded the bassawere sent only to watch him and to report his conduct to the sultan. Atlast the letters of revocation arrived the bassa was carried in chainsto Constantinople and in a short time the sultan that had deposed himwas murdered by the Janissaries.The princess who in the meantime had insinuated herself into manyprivate families proved equally unsuccessful in her inquiries. Shefound not one house that was not haunted by some fury that destroyed itsquiet."In families where there is or is not poverty" said she "there iscommonly discord. The love of parents and children seldom continuesbeyond the years of infancy in a short time the children become rivalsto their parents. Each child endeavours to appropriate the esteem orfondness of the parents and the parents betray each other to theirchildren. The opinions of children and parents of the young and theold are naturally opposite by the contrary effects of hope anddespondence of expectation and experience. Age looks with anger on thetemerity of youth and youth with contempt on the scrupulosity of age.""Surely" said the prince "you must have been unfortunate in yourchoice of acquaintance. I am unwilling to believe that the most tenderof all relations is thus impeded in its effects by natural necessity.""Domestic discord" answered she "is not inevitably necessary but itis not easily avoided. We seldom see that a whole family is virtuous.The good and the evil cannot well agree the evil can yet less agreewith one another and even the virtuous fall sometimes to variance whentheir virtues are of different kinds. As for those who live single Inever found that their prudence ought to raise envy. They dream awaytheir time without friendship and without fondness and are driven torid themselves of the day for which they have no use by childishamusements and vicious delights. They act as beings under the constantsense of some known inferiority that fills their minds with rancourand their tongues with censure.""I cannot forbear to flatter myself" said Rasselas "that prudence andbenevolence will make marriage happy. What can be expected butdisappointment and repentance from a choice made in the immaturity ofyouth in the ardour of desire without judgment without foresightwithout inquiry after conformity of opinions similarity of mannersrectitude of judgment or purity of sentiment. From these earlymarriages proceed the rivalry of parents and children."The son is eager to enjoy the world before the father is willing toforsake it and there is hardly room at once for two generations. Thedaughter begins to bloom before the mother can be content to fade andneither can forbear to wish for the absence of the other. Surely allthese evils may be avoided by that deliberation and delay which prudenceprescribes to irrevocable choice.""And yet" said Nekayah "I have been told that late marriages are noteminently happy. It has generally been determined that it is dangerous
comment881,for a man and woman to suspend their fate upon each other at a time whenopinions are fixed and habits are established when friendships havebeen contracted on both sides and when life has been planned intomethod."At this point Imlac entered and having refused to talk upon the subjectof their discourse persuaded them to visit the great pyramid."I consider this mighty structure" said he as they reposed in one ofits chambers "as a monument of the insufficiency of human enjoyments. Aking whose power is unlimited and whose treasures surmount all realand imaginary wants is compelled to solace by the erection of apyramid the satiety of dominion and tastelessness of pleasures and toamuse the tediousness of declining life by seeing thousands labouringwithout end and one stone for no purpose laid upon another."Soon afterwards the prince told Imlac that he intended to devote himselfto science and to pass the rest of his days in retirement."Before you make your final choice" answered Imlac "you ought toexamine its hazards and to converse with some of those who are grownold in the company of themselves."He then introduced him to a learned astronomer who had meditated overhis science and over visionary schemes for so long that he believed thathe possessed the regulation of the weather and the distribution of theseasons.A visit made subsequently to the catacombs tended still further to givea grave and sombre direction to the thoughts of the party."How gloomy" said Rasselas "would be these mansions of the dead to himwho did not know that he should never die that what now acts shallcontinue its agency and what now thinks shall think on forever. Thosethat lie here stretched before us the wise and the powerful of ancienttimes warn us to remember the shortness of our present state theywere perhaps snatched away while they were busy like us in thechoice of life.""To me" said the princess "the choice of life is become lessimportant I hope hereafter to think only on the choice of eternity."It was now the time of the inundations of the Nile and the searchersfor happiness were of necessity confined to their house. Beinghowever well supplied with materials for talk they diverted themselveswith comparisons of the different forms of life which they had observedand with various schemes of happiness which each of them had formed--schemes which now they well knew would never be carried out.They deliberated with Imlac what was to be done and finally resolvedwhen the inundation should cease to return to Abyssinia.                                   MAURUS JOKAITimar's Two Worlds     Maurus Jokai by common consent the greatest Hungarian     novelist of the nineteenth century was born at Komarom on     February 19 1825. Trained for the law as an advocate he     achieved the distinction of winning his first case. The     drudgery of a lawyer's office however proved uncongenial to     him and fired by the success of his first play "The Jew Boy"     "Zsid fiu" he went to Pest where he devoted himself to     journalism in due course becoming editor of "Eletkpek" a     leading Hungarian literary periodical. At the outbreak of the
comment882,     Revolution of 1848 he threw himself in with the supporters of     the national cause. From that time until his death--which     occurred on May 4 1904--Jokai identified himself considerably     with politics. Of all his novels perhaps "Az arany ember" "A     Man of Gold" translated into English under the title of     "Timar's Two Worlds" takes the highest place. Its reputation     has long since spread outside the boundaries of Hungary and     the story itself--a rare combination of descriptive power     humour and pathos--has exercised no small influence upon     European fiction of the romantic order._I.--How Ali Saved his Daughter_A mountain-chain pierced through from base to summit--a gorge fourmiles in length walled in by lofty precipices and between these wallsflows the Danube in its rocky bed.At this time there were no steamers on the Danube but a vessel calledthe St. Barbara approaches drawn against the stream by thirty-twohorses. The fate of the vessel lies in the hands of two men--the pilotand the captain.The name of the captain is Michael Timar. He is a man of about thirtywith fair hair and dreary blue eyes.At the door of the ship's cabin sits a man of fifty smoking a Turkishchibouque. Euthemio Trikaliss is the name under which he is registeredin the way-book and he is the owner of the cargo. The ship itselfbelongs to a merchant of Komorn called Athanas Brazovics.Out of one of the cabin windows looks the face of a young girl Timathe daughter of Euthemio and the face is as white as marble. Tima andher father are the only passengers of the St. Barbara.When the captain lays aside his speaking-trumpet he has time to chatwith Tima who understands only modern Greek which the captain speaksfluently.It is always a dangerous voyage for the current is fierce and the rocksare death-traps. To-day too the St. Barbara was pursued by a Turkishgunboat. But the vessel makes its way safely in spite of current androcks and the Turkish gunboat gives up the chase.Three days later the St. Barbara has reached the island of Orsova theplains of Hungary are to the north of the river Servia to the south.Provisions had run short and Timar decided to go on shore. There wereno signs of human habitation at first but Timar's sharp eyes haddiscovered a faint smoke rising above the tops of the poplars. He workedhis way in a small skiff through the reeds reached dry land pushedthrough hedges and bushes and then stood transfixed with admiration.A cultivated orchard of some five or six acres was before him andbeyond that a flower-garden full of summer bloom.Timar went up through the orchard and flower garden to a cottage builtpartly in the rock and covered with creepers. A huge blackNewfoundland dog was lying before the door.A woman's voice answered Timar's "good-morning" and the dog raised noobjection to the captain going indoors."It never hurts good people" said the woman.Timar explained his mission. The wind had brought his vessel to a
comment883,standstill he was short of provisions and he had two passengers whowould be grateful for shelter on land for the night.The woman promised him food and a room for his passengers in exchangefor grain and at her word the dog brought him by a better path to theriver.Presently Timar was back again with Euthemio and Tima and now a younggirl appeared whom the housewife called Noemi.Before supper was over the growling of the dog announced a new arrivaland a man of youthful appearance who introduced himself as TheodorKrisstyan an old friend of the lady of the house whom he called MadameTherese entered and made himself quickly at home. It was plain that hishostess both feared and disliked Theodor while Timar who had met himbefore regarded him as a spy in the pay of the Turkish government.In the morning the wind had gone down Theodor had vanished and Timarand his passengers prepared to renew their journey.Therese told Timar her story before he left how she and her daughterNoemi had lived there for twelve years and who the objectionableTheodor was. Then she added in a whisper "I fancy this man Krisstyan'svisit was either on your account or that of the other gentleman. Be onyour guard if either of you dread the discovery of a secret."Trikaliss looked very gloomy when he heard the stranger had left beforesunrise and the following night he called Timar to his cabin."I am dying" he said. "I want to die--I have taken poison. Tima willnot wake till all is over. My true name is not Euthemio Trikaliss butAli Tschorbadschi. I was once governor of Candia and then treasurer inStamboul. You know there is a revolution proceeding in Turkey my turnwas coming. Not that I was a conspirator but the treasury wanted mymoney and the seraglio my daughter. Death is easy for me but I will notlet my daughter go into the harem nor myself be made a beggar. ThereforeI hired your vessel and loaded it with grain. The owner AthanasBrazovics is a connection of mine I have often shown him kindness hecan return it now. By a miracle we got safely through the rocks andwhirlpools of the river and eluded the pursuit of the Turkishbrigantine and now I stumble over a straw into my grave."That man who followed us last evening was a spy of the Turkishgovernment. He recognised me and sealed my fate. The government wouldnot demand me from Austria as a political refugee but as a thief. Thisis unjust for what I took was my own. But I am pursued as a thief andAustria gives up escaped thieves if Turkish spies can trace them. Bydying I can save my daughter and her property. Swear to me by your faithand your honour you will carry out my instructions. Here in this casketis about a thousand ducats. Take Tima to Athanas Brazovics and beg himto adopt my daughter. Give him the money he must spend it on the
comment884,education of the child and give him also the cargo and beg him to bepresent when the sacks are emptied. You understand"The dying man looked in Timar's face and struggled for breath."Yes--the Red Crescent" he stammered. "The Red Crescent" Then thedeath-throes closed his lips--one struggle and he was a corpse._II.--Timor Tempted and Fallen_When the St. Barbara had nearly reached Komorn it struck an uprootedtree lying in ambush under water and immediately began to sink. It isabsolutely impossible to save a vessel wrecked in this way. The crew allleft the sinking craft and Timar rescued Tima and with her the casketwith the thousand ducats.Then the captain drove off with the fatherless girl to the house ofAthanas Brazovics in the town of Komorn.At first Athanas kissed Tima very heartily but when he learnt that hisvessel was lost and all Tima's property except the thousand ducatsand the wheat sacks--now spoilt by water--he altered his tune.He and his wife Sophie decided that Tima should live with them as anadopted child and at the same time attend on their daughter Athalie asa waiting-maid. Athalie and her mother treated the poor girl withscornful contempt.As for Timar Athanas turned on him savagely as though the captaincould have prevented the wreckOn the advice of his friend Lieutenant Katschuka who was betrothed toAthalie Timar purchased the sunken grain next day when it was put upfor auction buying the whole cargo for 10000 gulden. "You will do thepoor orphan a good turn if you buy it" said the lieutenant. "Otherwisethe value of the cargo will all go in salvage."Timar at once made arrangements for hauling up the sacks and for theimmediate drying and grinding of the corn and all day labourers were atwork on the wreck.At nightfall Timar left alone noticed one sack differently marked fromthe rest--marked with a red crescent Within this was a long leathernbag. He broke it open and found it full of diamonds emeralds andsapphires richly set in girdles and bracelets and rings. A whole heap ofunset diamonds were in an agate box. The whole treasure was worth atleast 1000000 gulden. The St. Barbara had carried a million on board"To whom does this treasure belong"Timar put the question to himself and answered it."Why whom should it belong to but you You bought the sunken cargojust as it is with the sacks and the grain. If the treasurer stole thejewels from the sultan the sultan probably stole them in hiscampaigns.""And Tima""Tima would not know how to use the treasure and her adopted fatherwould absorb it and get rid of nine-tenths of it. What would be theresult if Tima gets it She would be a rich lady and would not cast alook at you from her height. Now things are the other way--you will be arich man and she a poor girl. You do not want the treasure for yourself.You will invest it profitably and when you have earned with the firstmillion a second and a third you will go to the poor girl and say'There take it--it is all yours and take me too.' You only wish tobecome rich in order to make her happy."The moon and the waves cried to Timar "You are rich--you are a mademan"But when it was dark an inward voice whispered"You are a thief"From that day all Timar's undertakings flourished and step by step hereached the summit of an ordinary successful business man's ambition--the title of nobility. At the same time Brazovics who had treated Timarwith brutal inconsiderateness because of the wreck of the St. Barbarawent steadily down-hill borrowing and embezzling trust monies in hisfall.Lieutenant Katschuka had declared all along that he could not marryAthalie without a dowry and when the wedding day arrived Brazovics
comment885,unable to face his creditors and knowing himself bankrupt pennilessand fraudulent committed suicide. Katschuka immediately declared theengagement at an end. In his heart he had long wearied of Athalie andlooked with desire on Tima. The orphan girl from the first had lovedthe lieutenant with silent unspoken affection.When the Brazovics' house was put up for sale Timar bought it outrightfurniture and all and then said to Tima "From this day forth you arethe mistress of this house. Everything in it belongs to you all isinscribed in your name. Accept it from me. You are the owner of thehouse and if there is a little shelter for me in your heart and youdid not refuse my hand--then I should be only too happy."Tima gave her hand to Timar and said in a low firm voice "I acceptyou as my husband and will be a faithful and obedient wife."This man had always been so good to her. He had never made sport of hernor flattered her and he had saved her life on the Danube when the St.Barbara was sinking. He had given her all her heart could desire exceptone thing and that belonged to another._III.--The Ownerless Island_On his betrothal to Tima a great burden was lifted from the soul ofTimar. Since the day when the treasure of Ali Tschorbadschi had enabledhim to achieve power and riches Timar had been haunted by the voice ofself-accusation "This money does not belong to you--it was the propertyof an orphan. You are a man of gold You are a thief"But now the defrauded orphan had received back her property. Only Timarforgot that he had demanded in exchange the girl's heart.Tima promised to be a faithful and obedient wife but on the wedding-day when Timar said "Do you love me" she only opened wide her eyesand asked "What is love"Timar found he had married a marble statue and that all his richeswould not buy his wife's love. He became wretched conscious that hiswife was unhappy that he was the author of their mutual misery.Then in the early summer Timar went off from Komorn to shoot water-fowl. He meant to go to the ownerless island at Ostrova--it was threeyears since that former visit.Therese and Noemi welcomed him cordially at the island and Timar forgothis troubles when he was with them. Therese told him her story how herhusband ruined by the father of Theodor Krisstyan and by AthanasBrazovics had committed suicide and how forsaken and friendless she
comment886,had brought her child to this island which neither Austria nor Turkeyclaimed and where no tax-collector called. With her own hands she hadturned the wilderness into a paradise and the only fear she had wasthat Theodor Krisstyan who had discovered her retreat might reveal itto the Turkish government.Therese had no money and no use for it but she exchanged fruit andhoney for grain salt clothes and hardware and the people with whomshe bartered were not inclined to gossip about her affairs.So no news concerning the island ever went to Vienna Komorn orConstantinople and the fact of Timar's great prosperity had not reachedthe islanders. He was welcomed as a hard-working man and Therese didnot know that Timar had been powerful enough to get a ninety years'lease of the island from both Turkish and Austrian governments perhapsno very difficult matter as the existence of the island was unknownand there were fees to be paid over the concession.When he told her what he had done Noemi threw her arms round his neck.Theodor Krisstyan was furious but Timar procured him a post in Braziland for a long time the disreputable spy was too far off to betroublesome.And now on this island Timar found health and rest. It became his homeand for the summer months every year he would slip away from Komorn andno one not even Tima guessed his secret. When he returned Tima'scold white face was still an unsolved riddle to her husband. She wouldgreet him kindly but never was there any token that she loved him.Timar's ever-increasing business operations were excuse for his longabsences but all the same the double life he was leading made him ill.He could not tell Tima of Therese and Noemi and he could not tell themon the island that he was married.Tima on her side devoted herself more and more to her husband'sbusiness in his absence and when Major Katschuka once called and askedher if she could not arrange for a divorce she answered gently "Myhusband is the noblest man in the world. Should I separate from him whohas no one but me to love him Am I to tell him that I hate him I whoowe everything to him and who brought him no dowry but a lovelessheart"Timar learnt from Athalie who lived in Tima's house of this replyand felt more in despair than ever. He wanted Tima to be happy she hadnever been his wife except in name for he had been waiting for herlove.And he wanted to go away and leave all his riches behind and settle onthe island. Now more than ever was he wanted on the island for Theresehad died of heart failure and the years had made Noemi a woman._IV.--"My Name is Nobody"_It was winter and Timar had gone off alone to a house that belonged tohim near a frozen lake. He felt the time had come for flight butwhitherTheodor Krisstyan had turned up again. In Brazil he had heard a story ofAli Tschorbadschi's jewels from an old criminal from Turkey and he hadreturned to blackmail Timar. But he did not find him till Timar was at
comment887,the frozen lake.Krisstyan's story was not true. Timar knew that the accusations werefalse as he listened to the vagabond's indictment. He had not "killed"Tima's father nor "stolen" his treasure. But he had played a falsegame and his position was a false one. Krisstyan demanded a change ofraiment and Timar let him take clothes and shirts. But at last theblackmailer's demands became too insolent and Timar drove him out ofthe house.And now it seemed to Timar that his own career was finished. Thisruffian Krisstyan could expose the foundation of his wealth and howcould he live discredited before the worldOn the frozen water there were great fissures between the blocks of ice.Within the waves of the lake death would come quickly. Timar walked outon the ice and there before him the head of Theodor Krisstyan rose inthe water and then sank. The spy had not known the treachery of thefissures.Timar fled to the ownerless island and when the corpse of Krisstyan wasdiscovered in an advanced stage of decomposition Tima declared sherecognized her husband's clothes.So the body of Theodor Krisstyan was buried with great pomp and a yearlater Tima married Major Katschuka and then haunted by the doubtwhether her first husband was really dead pined away.No blessing rested on the wealth Timar left behind him. The only sonTima bore to the major was a great spendthrift and in his hands thefabulous wealth vanished as quickly as it had grown.                                   And what is passing meanwhile on the ownerless islandForty years have passed since Timar's disappearance from Komorn and theisland is now a complete model farm. Recently a friend of mine anardent naturalist took me to the island. I had heard as a child ofTimar and his wealth.Every inch of ground is utilised or serves to beautify the place. Thetobacco grown here has the most exquisite aroma and the beehives lookfrom a distance like a small town with many-shaped roofs.It is easy to see that the owner of the island understands luxury andyet that owner never has a farthing to call his own no money everenters the island. Those however who need the exports know also therequirements of the islanders and bring them for barter.The whole colony consisted of one family and each was called only byhis Christian name. The six sons of the first settler had married womenof the district and the numbers of grandchildren andgreat-grandchildren already exceeded forty but the island maintainedthem all. Poverty was unknown they lived in luxury each knew sometrade and if they had been ten times as many their labour would havesupported them.When we arrived on the island the nominal head of the family awell-built man of forty received us cordially and in the eveningpresented us to his parents.When my name was mentioned to the old man he looked long at me and avisible colour rose in his cheeks. I began to tell him of what was goingon in the world that Hungary was now united to Austria and that thetaxes were very heavy.He blew a cloud from his pipe and the smoke said "My island hasnothing to do with that we have no taxes here."I told him of wars financial panics the strife of religion andpolitics and the smoke seemed to say "We wage war with no one here.Thank God we have no money here and no elections or ministers."Presently the old man asked me where I was born and what my professionwas And when I told him that I wrote romances he said "Guess mystory. There was once a man who left a world in which he was admired andrespected and created a second world in which he was loved.""May I venture to ask your name" I said.The old man seemed to grow a head taller then raising his tremblinghands he laid them on my head. And it seemed to me as if once longlong before those same hands had rested on my head when childish curlscovered it and that I had seen that noble face before.
comment888,"My name is Nobody" he replied to my question and after that night Isaw him no more during our stay on the island.The privileges granted by two governments to the owner of the islandwill last for fifty years more. And who knows what may happen to theworld in fifty years                                   COULSON KERNAHANA Dead Man's Diary     Coulson Kernahan born at Ilfracombe England Aug. 1 1858     is a son of Dr. James Kernahan M.A. He has contributed     largely to periodicals and has written in many veins     alternating serious and religious works with sensational     novels and literary criticism with humour and sport. It is by     his imaginative booklets--now collected in one volume under     the title of "Visions"--that he is best known. These booklets     have circulated literally "by the million" and have been     translated into no fewer than sixteen languages including     Chinese. "A Dead Man's Diary" appeared anonymously in 1890     and attracted unusual attention the authorship being     attributed among others to Harold Frederic and Robert     Buchanan. Since then "A Dead Man's Diary"--of which Mr. J.M.     Barrie in reviewing it said "The vigour of the book is     great and the author has such a gift of intensity that upon     many readers it will have mesmeric effect"--has gone through     innumerable editions in England and in America._I.--The Ghost of the Past_Some years ago I became so seriously ill that I was pronounced dyingand finally dead. Dead to all intents and purposes I remained for twodays when to the astonishment of the physicians I exhibited symptomsof returning vitality and in a week was convalescent.Of the moments preceding my passing I recollect only that there cameover me a strange and sudden sense of loss as though some life-elementhad gone out from me. Of pain there was none nor any mental anxiety.I recollect only an ethereal lightness of limb and a sense ofsoul-emancipation and peace a sense of soul-emancipation such as onemight feel were he to awaken on a sunny summer morning to find thatsorrow and sin were gone from the world for ever a peace ample andrestful as the hallowed hush and awe of twilight without the twilight'stender pain.Then I seemed to be sinking slowly and steadily through still depths ofsun-steeped light-filled waters that sang in my ears with a sound likea sweet sad sobbing and soaring of music and through which there swam
comment889,up to me in watered vistas of light scenes of sunny seas and shiningshores where smiling isles stretched league beyond league afar.And so life ebbed away until there came a time when the outward anddeathward-setting tide seemed to reach its climax and when I feltmyself swept shoreward and lifeward again on the inward-setting tide ofthat larger life into which I had died.My next recollection is that the events of my past life were risingbefore me. The hands on the dial of time went back a score of years andI was a young man of twenty-one living in chambers off Holborn. Oneevening there burst over London a fearful thunderstorm and hearing aknock at my door I opened it to find a beautiful girl named Dorothythe daughter of the housekeeper standing there. Terrified by thelightning and finding herself alone she begged to be allowed to remainuntil her mother's return.The words had scarcely passed her lips before there came anotherblinding flash of lightning followed almost instantaneously by aterrific crash of thunder. With a cry of passion and fear she flung herarms around me and the next moment I found myself pressing her to myheart and telling her amid a score of burning kisses that I loved her.Almost immediately afterwards we heard the opening of doors whichindicated her mother's home-coming but before leaving Dorothy told methat the room immediately above mine was her own. Of the hell-bornthought which rose in my mind as I listened she I am sure had nosuspicion. Need I tell the remainder of my story I think not.                                   You may wonder perhaps why I recall circumstances that happened somany years ago. You would cease to wonder had you seen the ghost of thepast rise up to call upon God and His Christ for judgment upon thebetrayer. For this was my first glimpse of hell this was my day ofjudgment. The recording angel of my awakened conscience showed me mysin and the ruin my sin had wrought as God sees and I realisedthat--But no I am sick I am fainting I cannot--I cannot write more._II.--The Secret of Man's Destiny_"When anyone dies" I had been told in childhood "he goes either toheaven or to hell according to whether he has been a good or bad man"and I recollect being not a little troubled as to what became of thepeople whose virtues were about equally matched with their vices. When Iopened my eyes in that ante-chamber of the spirit-world into which Ihave had admittance I discovered that heaven and hell as separate placeshave no existence for the good the bad and the indifferent existtogether exactly as they exist here. I do not say that there will be noday of harvesting in which the tares shall finally be separated from thewheat. On that point as on many others I am ignorant. Men and womenwhom I know on earth speak of the dead--"the changed"--as being
comment890,perfected in knowledge and as having solved for ever "the great secret."That is not my experience.So far from "the great secret" the secret of man's destiny and God'sBeing becoming known at death the facts as I found them are that theseremain almost as great a mystery after death as before.Even in hell I use the word as indicating mental or physicalsuffering--in my case the former--not with any local significancethere are moments when the anguish-stricken spirit is mercifully alloweda temporary reprieve. Such a moment occurred after the first awfulparoxysm of self-loathing and torture which I experienced when my pastlife was made known to me in its true colours and it was in this sanerand comparatively painless interval that I met one whom I had known onearth as a woman of the purest life and character. Being still under theimpression that I was in hell in the sense in which I had beenaccustomed to think of that place I started back upon seeing her andcried out in astonishment "You here _You_ And in Hades""Where else should I be except where Arthur is" she answered quietlyand I then remembered a worthless brother of that name to whom she waspassionately attached. "Even Dives in the parable" she went on "wasunable to forget the five brethren he had left behind him and cried outamid the flames asking that Lazarus be sent to warn them lest theytoo came to that place of torment. Is it likely then that any wifemother or sister worthy the name would be content to remain idle inheaven knowing that a loved one was in hell and in agony We are toldthat after His death Christ preached to the spirits in prison and Ibelieve that He came here to hell in search of the so-called lost.""Tell me" I said "you who are in heaven if you are perfectly happy.""You are not altogether wrong in calling this heaven" she replied"although it is little more than the antechamber between earth andheaven. It is my heaven at present but it will not be my heaven alwaysany more than it will be always your hell and although it is heaven itis not _the_ heaven. When I was on earth I longed for heaven _not thatI might be delivered from sorrow but from sinfulness_ and I think Imay say that I am as happy here as my failures will let me be.""Your failures" I exclaimed. "I thought we had done with failures.""You remember the text in the Koran" she said. "'Paradise is under theshadow of swords.' Here as on earth there is no progress withouteffort and here too there are difficulties to be overcome. Yet evenon earth there was one element in the strife which lent dignity even toour failures. Sin and shame are after all only human the effort anddetermination to overcome them are divine. Ceasing to be an angel Satanbecame a devil. Man falls and even in his fall retains something ofGod."After a time we fell to talking of the past and mentioning the name ofthe very noblest man I have ever known a man who made possible thepurity of Sir Galahad made possible the courage of Coeur de Lion--I hadalmost said made possible the sinfulness of Christ--I inquired whethershe had seen him in Paradise."As yet" she answered "I know only one of the many circles into whichthe spirit-world seems naturally to resolve it. But I suspect that ifyou and I could see where he is we should find him infinitely nearer tothe Father-heart of the universe than I at least can for countless ageshope to attain""What do you mean by 'circles'" I said. "Is each human soul on itsarrival here assigned a fitting place and level among his or herspiritual fellows""There is some such gathering of like to like as that of which youspeak" she answered. "The majority begin in a lower circle and remainthere until they are fitted to move onward to a higher sphere. Otherstake a place in that higher sphere immediately and some few are ledinto the Holy Presence straightway."And then her voice seemed to sound to me like the voice of one in thefar distance I felt the darkness closing in upon me on every side and
comment891,knew that my hour of punishment was again at hand._III.--DEAD SOULS_Of all the faces which I saw in hell there was one which had for me afascination. It was that of a beautiful woman queenly of manner fairof figure as a fullblown lily and with those dark eyes that seem toshine out from soul-depths deep as the distant heaven and yet may meanno more than the shallow facing of quicksilver behind a milliner'smirror.On earth she had deliberately set herself to win and to break the heartof a trusting lad and the punishment of her sin was that she should nowlove him with the same intense but hopeless passion with which he hadloved her. "My heart is broken" I heard her sob "and in hell onecannot die of a broken heart. If I had loved him and he me and he haddied I could have borne it knowing that I should meet him hereafterbut to live loveless through eternity that is the thought which killsme."Another sight which I saw was that of a desolate plain low-lying andunlighted in the centre of which there roamed one who called out as ifin search of a companion but to whom there came no answer save the echoof his own voice. A more lonely and lifeless spot I have never seen. Thesilence seemed sometimes to oppress him like a presence for with ahalf-affrighted and despairing cry he set off at a panic-stricken runas if seeking to escape this silence by flight but notwithstanding hishaste he made no progress for he was but moving round and round in acircle. Once when he passed near me I heard him cry out "Is there noliving soul in all this void and voiceless desert" And as he hurriedby I recognised him as a man whom I had often heard say on earth thathell would not be hell to him so long as he and his boon companions weretogether.Another whom I saw in Hades I should--save for his pitiable effort toescape observation--have passed unnoticed. His pitfall in life had beenlove of approbation which was so strong that he was never happy exceptin perpetually endeavoring to pass himself off for that which he knew hewas not. The only aim of his existence had been to win the approval ofothers and lo one morning he awoke in Hades to find himself thedespised of the despised and the laughing stock of the very Devil. Isaw few more pitiable sights than that of this wretched creatureslinking shamefacedly through hell and wincing as from a blow at theglance of every passer.During my wanderings I had reason to ask one whom I had known on earthconcerning the fate of an old acquaintance of his own."I will tell you all I know of the man about whom you ask" he said"but first let me explain that my sorest hindrance on earth wasunbelief. Once when I might have believed I would not and mypunishment is that now when I would believe I cannot but am for evertorn by hideous apprehension and doubt. Moreover there are many thingswhich clear and plain as they may be to the faithful of heart and tothe believing are to my doubting eyes wrapt around in mystery. Intothese mysteries it has been ordained as part of my punishment that Ishall ever desire to look and of all these mysteries there is nonewhich fills me with such horror and dread as the mystery of the dead whodie.""Of the dead who die" I said. "What do you mean by those strange wordsSurely all who die are dead.""They are my words" he cried excitedly and with a hysterical laugh.
comment892,"The words I use to myself when I think of the mystery which they stroveso carefully to conceal from me but which for all their cunning I havediscovered. When first I came here I saw either in hell or in heaventhe faces of most of the dead whom I had known on earth but some facesthere were--the man of whom you ask was one--which I missed and fromthat time to this I have never seen. 'Where then are they' I askedmyself 'since neither earth hell nor heaven knows them more Has Godsome fearful fate in store for sinners which may one day fall upon meas it has already fallen upon them' And so I set myself to discoverwhat had become of these missing faces and you shall hear the result."When you and I were children we were taught that every human being isborn with an immortal soul. But they did not tell us that just asneglected diseases can kill the body so unchecked sin can kill thesoul. But it is so and that is what I meant when I said that he of whomyou asked was 'of the dead who die.'"You shake your head and mutter that I am mad. Well perhaps I ammad--mad with the horror of my unbelief but why should it not be as Isay When God made man He made a creature to whom it was given to choosefor himself between good and evil. But God knew that some of those Hehad thus made would deliberately choose evil that some few would indeedsin away all trace of their Divine origin. God did not _will_ it so forHe made us men not machines and the evil we do is of our own choosingbut God _fore-knew_ it and foreknowing that God owed it to Himselfnot to call into being a creature the result of whose creation would bethat creature's eternal misery. Hence it was that He decreed that thosefor whom there could be no hope of heaven should die out at their deathslike the brutes. Our life is from God and may not God take His ownagain And could anything better happen to many people whom you and Ihave known on earth than that they should be allowed to die out and thevery memory of them to pass away for ever"I was convinced that he was mad--mad as he had himself hinted with thehorror of his unbelief."And I am one of them" he exclaimed. "I am of the dead who die I havebartered away life faith and happiness for Dead Sea fruit I who oncewas young and not altogether as I now am a soulless creature of clayFor I can remember the time when flowers pictures beautiful faces andmusic set stirring emotions within me in which it seemed that I sawhidden away in the depths of my own heart the shining form of awhite-robed soul-maiden who cried out to me 'Ah cannot you make yourlife as pure and beautiful as the flowers and the music that so you mayset me free'"But I chose the ignoble part and gave myself up body and soul toevil and unbelief. And often in the hour when I was tempted to someshameful action I seemed to see the white arms of the soul-maidenuplifted in piteous entreaty to heaven but at last the time came whenher voice was silent and when I knew that I had thrust her down into adarkness whence she would never again come forth"And now the very soul of me is dead and I know not but that at anymoment I may flicker out like a spent taper and become as one of thedead who die"_IV.--On the Brink of the Pit_At last there came a time even in hell when the burden of my sin lay
comment893,so heavily upon me that I felt if succour there was none the very soulof me must die.Of myself save for the continual crying out of my soul after its lostpurity I scarcely cared to think. It was for Dorothy that I neverceased to sorrow and--sinner though I was--to pray. I saw thenpictured forth in all their horror the inevitable consequences of thewrong I had done her. I saw her with the sense of her sin as yet butfresh upon her shrinking from every glance and fancying that she readthe knowledge of her guilt in every eye. I saw her not knowing where toturn for refuge from swiftly advancing shame and understanding no moreof this life of ours than a foolish lost lamb wandering farther andfarther in the nightfall.And then--driven out from their midst by the very Christian women whoshould have been the first to have held out a hand to save--I saw herturn away with a heart hardened into indifference and plunge headlonginto a bottomless gulf of ignominy and sin. Nor did the vision passuntil out of that seething vortex of lust and infamy I saw arise theblack phantom of a lost soul crying out unto God and His Christ forjudgment upon the betrayer.As these hideous spectres of the past came before me I fell to theground borne down by a burden of agony greater even than the verydamned in hell can bear. But even as I fell that burden was lifted andborne away from me and then I saw as in a vision One kneeling inprayer. And I who had cried out that I could bear the burden of my sinno longer saw that upon Him was laid not only my sin but the sins ofthe whole world and that He stooped of His own accord to receive them.And as I looked upon the Divine dignity of that agonised form--forsakenof His Father that we might never be forsaken--I saw great beads ofblood break out like sweat upon His brow and I heard wrung from Him acry of such unutterable anguish as never before rose from human lips.And at that cry the vision passed and I awoke to find myself in hellonce more but in my heart there was a stirring as of the wings ofhope--the hope which I had deemed dead for ever._Could_ it be--O God of mercy was it possible that even now it mightnot be too late--that there was indeed One Who could make my sin asthough it had never beenBut to this hope there succeeded a moment when the agonised thought"How if there be no Christ" leapt out at me like the darkness whichlooms but the blacker for the lightning-flash a moment when hell gothold of me again and a thousand gibbering devils arose to shriek in myear "And though there be a Christ is it not now too late"I reeled at that cry and the darkness once more closed in around. Ahorde of hideous thoughts the very spawn of hell swarmed like verminin my mind there was the breath as of a host of contending fiends uponmy face a hundred hungry hands seemed to lay hold on me and to striveto drag me down and down to a bottomless pit that opened at my veryfeet and into which I felt myself slipping. With a great cry to God I
comment894,strove to rise but my strength failed me and I had fallen back intothe abyss had not one white-robed as the morning come suddenly tosuccour me by stretching forth a hand of aid and so--beating andbattling like a drowning man for breath--I fought my way out and fellsobbing and faint upon the pit's brink. And with a great cry of anguishI prayed aloud "Lord Christ I am foul and sinful I do not know that Ilove Thee I do not even know that I have repented of my sins I onlyknow that I cannot do the things I would do and that I can never undothe evil I have done. But I come to Thee Lord Jesus I come to Thee asThou biddest me. Send me not away O Saviour of sinners."As I made an end of praying I looked up and saw standing beside me Onethorn-crowned and with wounded side _Whose features were the featuresof a man but Whose face was the face of God_.And as I looked upon that face I shrank back dazed and breathless andblinded--shrank back with a cry like the cry of one smitten of thelightning for beneath the wide white brows there shone out eyes beforethe awful purity of which my sin-stained soul seemed to scorch and toshrivel like a scroll in a furnace. But as I lay lo there came atender touch upon my head and a voice in my ear that whispered "Son."And as the word died away into a silence like the hallowed hush oflistening angels and I stretched forth my arms with a cry ofunutterable longing and love I say that He held one by the hand--eventhe one who had plucked me out of the abyss into which I had fallen--andI saw that it was Dorothy--Dorothy whom He had sought out and saved fromthe shame to which my sin had driven her and whom He had sent tosuccour me that so He might set upon my soul the seal of His pardon andof His peace.                                   CHARLES KINGSLEYAlton Locke     Charles Kingsley English novelist poet and clergyman was     born June 12 1819 and died Jan. 23 1875. The son of the     rector of Chelsea London Kingsley went from King's College     London to Cambridge taking his B.A. degree in 1842 and     becoming rector of Eversley in 1844. He was made one of the     Queen's chaplains in 1859 and in 1873 was appointed canon of     Westminster. After publishing "Village Sermons" and "The     Saint's Tragedy" Kingsley took part with F.D. Maurice in the     Christian Socialist movement of 1848 attacking the horrible     sweating then rife in the tailoring trade calling attention     to the miserable plight of the agricultural labourer and the     need for sanitary reform in town and country. In "Alton Locke     Tailor and Poet" first published in 1849 Kingsley writes     from the point of view of the earnest artisan of sixty years     ago and the success of the book following the author's     pamphlet on "Cheap Clothes and Nasty" did much to stimulate     social and philanthropic work in London and other great     industrial centres. Various editions of the novels of Kingsley     are obtainable._I.--A Sweating Shop_I am a cockney among cockneys.My earliest recollections are of a suburban street of his jumble oflittle shops and little terraces.My mother was a widow. My father whom I cannot recollect was a smallretail tradesman in the city. He was unfortunate and when he died asmany small tradesmen do of bad debts and a broken heart he left usbeggars and my mother came down and lived penuriously enough in thatsuburban street.My mother moved by rule and method by God's law as she considered andthat only. She seldom smiled. She never commanded twice withoutpunishing. And yet she kept the strictest watch over our morality.Sometimes on a Sunday evening the ministers of the Baptist chapel would
comment895,come in to supper after the meeting. The elder was a silver-haired oldman who loved me and I loved him too for there were always lollipopsin his pocket for me and for my only sister Susan. The other was ayounger man tall and dark. He preached a harsher doctrine than hisgentler colleague and was much the greater favourite at the chapel. Ihated him and years later he married my sister.When I had turned thirteen my father's brother who had risen inwealth and now was the owner of a first-rate grocery business in theCity and a pleasant villa at Herne Hill and had a son preparing forCambridge came to visit us. When he had gone my mother told me verysolemnly and slowly that I was to be sent to a tailor's workrooms thenext day.What could my uncle make me but a tailor--or a shoemaker A paleconsumptive boy all forehead and no muscle.With a beating heart I shambled along by my mother's side to Mr. Smith'sshop in a street off Piccadilly and here Mr. Smith handed me over toMr. Jones the foreman with instructions to "take the young manupstairs to the workroom."I stumbled after Mr. Jones up a dark narrow iron staircase till weemerged through a trap-door into a garret at the top of the house. Irecoiled with disgust at the scene before me and here I was towork--perhaps through life A low room stifling me with the combinedodours of human breath and perspiration stale beer the sweet sicklysmell of gin and the sour and hardly less disgusting one of new cloth.On the floor thick with dust and dirt scraps of stuff and ends ofthread sat some dozen haggard untidy shoeless men with a mingledlook of care and recklessness that made me shudder. The windows weretight-closed to keep out the cold winter air and the condensed breathran in streams down the panes.The foreman turned to one of the men and said "Here Crossthwaitetake this younker and make a tailor of him. Keep him next you and prickhim with your needle if he shirks."Mechanically as if in a dream I sat down and as the foreman vanisheda burst of chatter rose. A tall sharp-nosed young man bawled in my ear"I say young 'un do you know why we're nearer heaven here than ourneighbours""Why" I asked."Acause we're the top of the house in the first place and next placeyer'll die here six months sooner nor if yer worked in the room below.Concentrated essence of man's flesh is this here as you're a-breathing.Cellar workroom we calls Rheumatic Ward acause of the damp. Groundfloor's Fever Ward--your nose'd tell yer why if you opened the backwindy. First floor's Ashmy Ward--don't you hear 'um now through thecracks in the boards apuffing away like a nest of young locomotivesAnd this here most august and uppercrust cock-loft is the ConsumptiveHospital. First you begins to cough then you proceeds to expectorateand then when you've sufficiently covered the poor dear shivering backsof the hairystocracy--    Die die die    Away you fly    Your soul is in the skyas the hinspired Shakespeare wittily remarks."And the ribald lay down on his back stretched himself out andpretended to die in a fit of coughing which last was alas nocounterfeit while poor I shocked and bewildered let my tears fallfast upon my knees.I never told my mother into what pandemonium I had fallen but from thattime my great desire was to get knowledge. I fancied that gettingknowledge I should surely get wisdom and books I thought would tellme all I needed.That was how it was I came to know Sandy Mackaye whose old book-shop Iused to pass on my walk homeward. One evening as I was reading one ofthe books on his stall the old man called me in and asked me abruptlymy name and trade and family.I told him all and confessed my love of books. And Mackaye encouragedme and taught me Latin and soon had me to lodge in his old shop formy mother in her stern religion would not have me at home because Icould not believe in the Christianity which I heard preached in the
comment896,Baptist chapel._II.--I Move Among the Gentlefolks_The death of our employer threw many of us out of work for the son whosucceeded to the business determined to go ahead with the times and tothat end decided to go in for the "show-trade" which meant analteration in the premises the demolition of the work-rooms and thegiving out of the work to be made up at the men's own homes.Mackaye would have me stay with him."Ye'll just mind the shop and dust the books whiles" he said.But this I would not do for I thought the old man could not afford tokeep me in addition to himself. Then he suggested that I should go toCambridge and see my cousin with a view to getting the poems publishedwhich I had been writing ever since I started tailoring."He's bound to it by blude" said Sandy "and I'm thinking ye'd bettertry to get a list o' subscribers."So to Cambridge I went.It was some time since I had seen my cousin George and at our lastmeeting he had taken me to the Dulwich Gallery. It was there that twoyoung ladies one so beautiful that I was dazzled and an elderlyclergyman whom my cousin told me was a dean had spoken to me about thepictures and that interview marked a turning point in my life. When Igot to Cambridge and had found my cousin's rooms I was received kindlyenough."You couldn't have got on at tailoring--much too sharp a fellow forthat" he said on hearing my story. "You ought to be at college if onecould only get you there. Those poems of yours--you must let me havethem and look over them and I dare say I shall be able to persuade thegovernor to do something with them."Lord Lynedale came to my cousin's rooms next day--George told me plainlythat he made friends with those who would advance him when he was aclergyman--and taking an interest in a self-educated author bade mebring my poems to the Eagle and ask for Dean Winnstay. Lord Lynedale wasto marry Dean Winnstay's niece. When I arrived at the Eagle the firstperson I saw was Lillian--for so her father the dean called her--theyounger lady my heroine of the Dulwich Gallery looking more beautifulthan ever. I could have fallen down--fool that I was--and worshipped--what I could not tell you for I cannot tell even now.The dean smiled recognition bade me sit down and disposed my papers onhis knee. I obeyed him trembling my eyes devouring my idol forgettingwhy I had come seeing nothing but her listening for nothing but theopening of those lips."I think I may tell you at once that I am very much surprised andgratified with your poems" said the old gentleman."How very fond of beautiful things you must be Mr. Locke" said
comment897,Lillian "to be able to describe so passionately the longing afterthem"I stammered out something about working-men having very fewopportunities of indulging the taste for--I forget what."Ah yes I dare say it must be a very stupid life. So littleopportunity as he says. What a pity he is a tailor papa Such anunimaginative employment How delightful it would be to send him tocollege and make him a clergyman"Fool that I was I fancied--what did I not fancy--never seeing how thatvery "_he_" bespoke the indifference--the gulf between us. I was not aman an equal but a thing--a subject who was to be talked over andexamined and made into something like themselves of their supreme andundeserved benevolence."Gently Gently fair lady" said the dean. "We must not be as headlongas some people would kindly wish to be. If this young man really has aproper desire to rise to a higher station and I find him a fit objectto be assisted in that praiseworthy ambition why I think he ought togo to some training college. Now attend to me sir Recollect if itshould be in our power to assist your prospects in life you must giveup once and for all the bitter tone against the higher classes which Iam sorry to see in your MSS. Next I think of showing these MSS. to mypublisher to get opinion as to whether they are worth printing justnow. Not that it is necessary that you should be a poet. Most activeminds write poetry at a certain age. I wrote a good deal I recollectmyself. But that is no reason for publishing."At this point Lillian fled the room to my extreme disgust. But stillthe old man prosed."I think therefore that you had better stay with your cousin for thenext week. I hear from Lord Lynedale that he is a very studious moralrising young man and I only hope that you will follow his good example.At the end of the week I shall return home and then I shall be glad tosee more of you at my house at D----. Good-morning"My cousin and I stayed at D---- long enough for the dean to get a replyfrom the publishers concerning my poems. They thought that the sale ofthe book might be greatly facilitated if certain passages of a strongpolitical tendency were omitted they were somewhat too strong for thepresent state of the public taste.On the dean's advice I weakly consented to have the book emasculated.Next day I returned to town for Sandy Mackaye had written me acharacteristic note telling me that he could deposit any trash I hadwritten in a paper called the "Weekly Warwhoop."Before I went from D---- my cousin George warned me not to pay so muchattention to Miss Lillian if I wished to stand well with Eleanor thedean's niece who was to marry Lord Lynedale. He left me suspecting thathe had remarked Eleanor's wish to cool my admiration for Lillian andwas willing for his own purposes to further it._III.--Riot and Imprisonment_At last my poems were printed and published and I enjoyed the sensationof being a real live author. What was more my book "took" and sold andwas reviewed favourably in journals and newspapers.It struck me that it would be right to call upon the dean and so I wentto his house off Harley Street. The good old man congratulated me on mysuccess and I saw Lillian and sat in a delirium of silent joy. LordLynedale had become Lord Ellerton and I listened to the praises thatwere sung of the newly married couple--for Eleanor had become LadyEllerton and had entered fully into all her husband's magnificentphilanthropic schemes--a helpmeet if not an oracular guide.After this I had an invitation to tea in Lillian's own hand and thencame terrible news that Lord Ellerton had been killed by a fall from hishorse and that the dean and Miss Winnstay had left London and forthree years I saw them no more.What happened in those three yearsMackaye had warned me not to follow after vanity. He was a Chartist andwith him and Crossthwaite my old fellow-workman I was vowed to theGood Cause of the Charter. Now I found that I had fallen under
comment898,suspicion."Can you wonder if our friends suspect you" said Crossthwaite. "Can youdeny that you've been off and on lately between flunkeydom and theCause like a donkey between two bundles of hay Have you not neglectedour meetings Have you not picked all the spice out of your poemsThough Sandy is too kind-hearted to tell you you have disappointed usboth miserably and there's the long and short of it."I hid my face in my hands. My conscience told me that I had nothing toanswer.Mackaye to spare me went on to talk of the agricultural distress andCrossthwaite explained that he wanted to send a deputation down to thecountry to spread the principles of the Charter."I will go" I said starting up. "They shall see I do care for theCause. Where is the place""About ten miles from D----.""D----" My heart sank. If it had been any other spot But it was toolate to retract.With many instructions from our friends and warnings from Mackaye Istarted next day on my journey. I arrived in the midst of a drearytreeless country and a little pert snub-nosed shoemaker met me and wewalked together across the open down towards a circular camp theearthwork probably of some old British town.Inside it some thousand or so of labouring people all wan and haggardwith many women among them were swarming restlessly round a singlelarge block of stone.I made my way to the stone and listened as speaker after speaker pouredout a string of incoherent complaints. Only the intense earnestness gaveany force to the speeches.I noticed that many of the crowd carried heavy sticks and pitchforksand other tools which might be used as fearful weapons and when afierce man with a squint asked who would be willing to come "and pullthe farm about the folks' ears" I felt that now or never was the timefor me to speak. If once the spirit of mad aimless riot broke loose Ihad not only no chance of a hearing but every likelihood of beingimplicated in deeds which I abhorred.I sprang on the stone assured them of the sympathy of the Londonworking-men and explained the idea of the Charter.To all which they answered surlily that they did not know anything aboutpolitics--that what they wanted was bread.In vain I went on more vehement than ever the only answer was thatthey wanted bread. "And bread we will have""Go then" I cried losing my self-possession. "Go and get breadAfter all you have a right to it. There are rights above all laws andthe right to live is one."I had no time to finish. The murmur swelled into a roar for "BreadBread" And amid yells and execrations the whole mass poured down thehill sweeping me away with them. I was shocked and terrified at theirthreats. I shouted myself hoarse about the duty of honesty warned them
comment899,against pillage and violence but my voice was drowned in the uproar. Ifelt I had helped to excite them and dare not in honour desert themand trembling I went on prepared to see the worst.A large mass of farm buildings lay before us and the mob rushedtumultuously into the yard--just in time to see an old man on horsebackgallop hatless away."The old rascal's gone And he'll call up the yeomanry We must bequick boys" shouted one.The invaders entered the house and returned cramming their mouths withbread and chopping asunder flitches of bacon. The granary doors werebroken open and the contents were scrambled for amid immense waste bythe starving wretches.Soon the yard was a pandemonium as the more ruffianly part of the mobhurled furniture out of windows or ran off with anything they couldcarry. The ricks had been fired and the food of man the labour ofyears devoured in aimless ruin when some one shouted "The yeomanry"And at that sound a general panic ensued.I did not care to run. I was utterly disgusted disappointed withmyself--the people. I just recollect the tramp of the yeomanry horsesand a clear blade gleaming in the air and after that I recollectnothing--till I awoke and found myself lying on a truckle-bed in D----gaol and a warder wrapping my head with wet towels.Mackaye engaged an old compatriot as attorney at the trial and I wascongratulated on "only getting three years."The weary time went by. Week after week month after month summer aftersummer I scored the days off like a lonely schoolboy on the pages ofa calendar.Not till I was released did I learn from Sandy Mackaye that my cousinGeorge was the vicar of his church and that he was about to marryLillian Winnstay._IV.--In Exile_Brave old Sandy Mackaye died on the morning of the tenth of April 1848the day of the great Chartist demonstration at Kennington Common.Mackaye had predicted failure and every one of his predictions cametrue. The people did not rise. Whatever sympathy they had with us theydid not care to show it. The meeting broke up pitiably piecemealdrenched and cowed body and soul by pouring rain.That same night after wandering dispiritedly in the streets by theriver I was sick with typhus fever.I know not for how long my dreams and delirium lasted but I know thatat last I sank into a soft weary happy sleep.Then the spell was snapped. My fever and my dreams faded away togetherand I woke to the twittering of the sparrows and the scent of thepoplars and found Eleanor Lady Ellerton and her uncle sitting by mybed and with them Crossthwaite's little wife.I would have spoken but Eleanor laid her finger on her lips and takingher uncle's arm glided from the room.Slowly and with relapses into insensibility I passed like one whorecovers from drowning through the painful gate of birth into anotherlife.Crossthwaite and his wife as they sat by me tender and careful nursesboth told me in time that to Eleanor I owed all my comforts. "She's anangel out of heaven" he said. "Ah Alton she was your true friend allthe time and not that other one if you had but known it."I could not rest till I had heard more of Lady Ellerton."Why then she lives not far off. When her husband died she came mywife Katie tells me and lived for one year down somewhere in the EastEnd among the needlewomen. And now she's got a large house hereby withfifty or more in it all at work together sharing the earnings amongthemselves and putting into their own pockets the profits which wouldhave gone to their tyrants and she keeps the accounts for them andgets the goods sold and manages everything and reads to them while
comment900,they work and teaches them every day."Crossthwaite went on to speak of Mackaye."When old Mackaye's will was read he had left 400 he'd saved to beparted between you and me on condition that we'd go and cool downacross the Atlantic and if it hadn't been for your illness I'd havebeen in Texas now."Often did I see Eleanor in those days of convalescence but it was nottill a month had gone by that I summoned courage to ask after my cousin.Eleanor looked solemnly at me."Did you not know it He is dead--of typhus fever. He died three weeksago and not only he but the servant who brushed his clothes and theshopman who had a few days before brought him a new coat home.""How did you learn all this""From Mr. Crossthwaite who found out that you most probably caught yourfever from a house near Blackfriars and in that house this very coathad been turned out and had covered a body dead of typhus."Half unconscious I stammered Lillian's name inquiringly."She is much changed sorrow and sickness--for she too has had thefever--have worn her down. Little remains now of that loveliness----""Which I idolised in my folly.""I tried to turn you from your dream. I knew there was nothing there foryour heart to rest upon. I was even angry with you for being the_protg_ of anyone but myself."                                   Eleanor bade me go and I obeyed her and sailed--and here I am. And shebade me write faithfully the story of my life and I have done so.Yes I have seen the land Like a purple fringe upon the golden sea. ButI shall never reach the land. Weaker and weaker day by day withbleeding lungs and failing limbs I have travelled the ocean paths. Theiron has entered too deeply into my soul.                                   This is an extract from a letter by John Crossthwaite."Galveston Texas October 1848."And now for my poor friend whose papers according to my promise tohim I transmit to you. On the very night on which he seems to haveconcluded them--an hour after we had made the land--we found him in hiscabin dead resting peacefully as if he had slumbered."                                   Hereward the Wake     With the appearance of "Hereward the Wake" sometimes called     "Hereward the Last of the English" Kingsley brought to a     close a remarkable series of works of fiction. Although the     story was not published until 1866 the germ of it came to     Kingsley according to Mrs. Kingsley's "Memoirs" of her     husband during the summer of 1848 while on a visit to     Crowland Abbey near Peterborough with the Rev. F.D. Maurice.     As its title implies the romance is suggested by the life and     adventures of Hereward a Saxon yeoman who flourished about     1070. The story itself perhaps does not move along with the     same spirit and vigour that characterise Kingsley's earlier     works it shows nevertheless that he had lost none of his
comment901,     cunningness for dramatic situations nor his vivid powers of     visualising scenes and events of the past._I.--Hereward Seeks His Fortune_In the year of Canute's death was born Hereward second son of LeofricEarl of Mercia and Godiva. At the age of eighteen he was a wildheadstrong passionate lad short in stature but very broad and hiseyes were one blue and one grey. Always in trouble with authority theclimax came when he robbed Herluin steward of Peterborough of a sum ofsixteen silver pennies collected for the use of the monastery and forthis exploit he was outlawed.Accordingly he left his home and went north to Siward who was engagedin war with Macbeth and for aught we know he may have helped to bringgreat Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill. However that may be he stayedin Scotland with one Gilbert of Ghent at whose house among otherdoughty deeds single-handed he slew a mighty white bear that escapedfrom captivity incidentally saving the life of a pretty little maidennamed Alftruda and earning the hatred of the other men who had notdared to face the bear.Finding Scotland a little uncomfortable in consequence he went toCornwall taking with him only his faithful servant Martin and there atthe court of Alef a Danish kinglet he had cause to kill a localcelebrity a giant named Ironhook who was betrothed to Alef's daughterthough much against her will she being in love with Sigtryg son ofRanald king of Waterford.So Hereward went to Waterford with a ring and a message from theprincess returning later with Sigtryg only to find that Alef hadbetrothed his daughter afresh to Hannibal of Marazion and the weddingceremony was actually proceeding when they arrived. An ambush was laidfor the returning bridal party Hannibal duly accounted for and theprincess carried off to Waterford where they    Prepared another wedding    With all their hearts so full of glee.Earl Leofric dead Hereward determined to take the risk of returninghome to which end he begged two ships from Ranald and set sail. Thrownby a storm on the Flanders coast he and all his men were like to havebeen knocked on the head after the friendly custom of the times butfor the intervention of Arnoul grandson of Baldwin of Flanders.Entering his service Hereward assisted Baldwin in an argument withEustace of Guisnes who differed with his lord on the question ofpayment of certain dues and so keenly did he reason that the differenceof opinion was satisfactorily composed--from Baldwin's point of view.Anon a war with Holland claimed attention but in the meantime Herewardhad fallen in love with a most beautiful damsel named Torfrida niece ofthe Abbot of St. Berlin reputed a sorceress. Her favour he won in thelists from Sir Ascelin to whom she had committed it and upon him shebestowed it together with her love and a suit of magic armour throughwhich no sword could pierce.Then Hereward went off to Holland and there he encountered DirkHammerhand from whom to take a buffet was never to need another andbought from him his famous mare Swallow the price agreed on being thehalf of what Hereward had offered and a box on the ear."Villain" groaned Dirk as he lay on the ground. "It was I who was togive the buffet not thou""Art mad" said Hereward as he coolly picked up the coins which Dirkhad scattered in his fall. "It is the seller's business to take and thebuyer's to give."In Holland Hereward remained a year but as under the terms of a wagermade in a boastful mood he went through the campaign without any armourand without changing his clothes it was a disreputable looking man withmany a wound who returned to Bruges where at the court of Adela a
comment902,jest was played on Torfrida by the countess not without the privity ofHereward.For before all her ladies Adela took her to task for having so longremained unmarried. Then forming the assembly into a court of love sheasked the ladies what punishment should be meted out. One said onething one another."Marry her to a fool" said Richilda."Too common a misfortune" said the Lady of France. "No" said she. "Wewill marry her to the first man who enters the castle."And from her sentence there was no appeal. Married poor Torfrida mustbe and to the first man who happened in be he who he might. And thefirst man was a ragged beggarman with whom when he was introduced intothe presence Torfrida was preparing to deal in her own way with alittle knife be the cost what it might when she recognised the eye ofgrey and the eye of blue._II.--Hereward Encounters Some Old Friends_In the spring it was hey for the war again whence Hereward returned inNovember to find himself the father of a daughter and the recipient ofletters from Harold of England and William of Normandy both asking hisassistance. Regarding Harold as a usurper Hereward bluntly told him so.To William his reply was equally decisive but less uncompromising."When William is King of all England Hereward will put his handsbetween his and be his man."Whereat William laughed. "It is a fair challenge from a valiant man" hesaid to the messenger. "The day shall come when I shall claim it."In Bruges one day Hereward found Gilbert of Ghent who for reasons ofhis own had come thither with his ward Alftruda and mightilydisappointed was Gilbert to find him married for he had a schemewhereby Hereward should marry Alftruda and he should share her dowrywhich was great. Alftruda too was mightily displeased as she seemedone whom Hereward thought the most beautiful he had ever beheld indeedfor one moment he even forgot Torfrida and gazed at her spellbound. Theonly remark she vouchsafed to her former preserver was a whispered "Soyou could not wait for me" and then passed on to marry DolfinGospatric's eldest son and Gilbert pursued his way to France to jointhe Norman.After that news came thick and fast.News of Harold Hardraada sailing to England with a mighty host of howthe Gonfanon of St. Peter had come to Rouen of William of Normandy'spreparations at St. Pierre sur Dive of the Norsemen landing in theHumber. Anon the news of Stamford Bridge and Hardraada's death andlastly news of Senlac and the death of the other Harold.For well-nigh three years after these great happenings Hereward stayedin Flanders grieving for the woes that had come upon his native land.Not that he sat moping all the time for some deed of arms was ever onhand to afford distraction but in the main his thoughts all turned onschemes for freeing England from the French tyrant. But not till GydaHarold's widowed mother came to Baldwin for sanctuary did he take anyovert action.By skilful flattery not unmixed with truth she persuaded him that hewas the man destined to free England once more and so one morning heset out alone accompanied only by Martin Lightfoot and a dozenhouse-carles to spy out the land and see what might be done. Within aweek he landed at Boston only to find that Bourne his home had beenbestowed upon the cook of Gilbert of Ghent and that at that moment hisyounger brother's head was decorating the gable of the hall.And so to Bourne went Hereward by night and burst in upon the Frenchmenduring a drunken carouse in the morning there were fifteen heads uponthe gable to replace the one that he had taken down overnight. Forthwith
comment903,he returned to Flanders having bestowed his mother in safety atCrowland Abbey with a promise to his countrymen of the Fens that hewould return to aid them shortly._III.--Hereward in England_Having settled his affairs in Flanders in due time he landed once morein the Wash with Torfrida and the child and two shiploads of stoutfighters with whom he went through Fenland raising an army. In thespring came Sweyn with his Danes all eager for plunder and Herewardhad much ado to prevent them from plundering Crowland Abbey onlysucceeding by promising them a richer booty in Peterborough.So Peterborough they took and sacked but at Peterborough Hereward foundAlftruda who had left her husband and rescued her from the Danesduring the sack of the minster. And looking upon her extraordinarybeauty for the second time he forgot Torfrida but for all that he senther for safety to old Gilbert of Ghent who had thrown in his lot withWilliam and was now at Lincoln. Having done with Peterborough andlater with Stamford the army marched to Ely and there encamped.And in Ely a great council was held after which Sweyn and all his Danesreturned home. For as Sweyn truly said "While William the Frenchman isking by the sword and Edgar the Englishman king by proclamation ofearls and thanes there seems no room here for Sweyn nephew of Canuteking of kings." To which Hereward could advance no good reason to provethat there was. Anon came William of Ely and built a floating bridge afull half-mile in length across the black abyss of mud and reeds thatyawned between the island and the mainland. But the bridge was unable tobear the weight of all the French who crowded on to it the fasteningsat the shore-end broke and the bridge itself overturned so that allupon it were thrown into the mud and miserably drowned.Whereon William withdrew his forces to Brandon for a space andHereward being minded to find out for himself what next was purposedagainst the island followed him thither with shorn hair and beard anddisguised as a travelling potter. Anon he came to William's palace withhis good mare Swallow bearing on her back a load of crockery. At thepalace he narrowly escaped recognition being sent to the kitchen wherehe got into a quarrel with the scullions. In consequence of which he washaled before William himself who quickly detected that he was otherthan he pretended."Look you" said William "you are no common churl--you have fought toowell for that show me your arm."Hereward drew up his sleeve."Potters do not carry sword-scars like these nor are they tattooed likeEnglish thanes. Hold up thy head man and let me see thy throat."Aha so I suspected. There is fair ladies' work there. Is not this hewho was said to be so like Hereward Very good. Put him in ward till Icome back from hunting but do him no harm. For were he Herewardhimself I should be right glad to see Hereward safe and sound my manat last and earl of all between Humber and the Fens." WhereuponHereward was clapped into an outhouse whence he escaped forthwith bythe simple device of cutting off the head of the man sent to fetter himand the good mare Swallow bore him back to Ely in safety.A little later William came again to Ely and built a stronger bridgebut this the English destroyed by fire with many of the French on itsetting the reeds aflame on the windward side of it.Some other scheme must now be thought out and the one that pleasedWilliam most was to send to the monks a proclamation that unless theysubmitted within a week all their lands and manors outside the islandwould be confiscated. Furthermore that if Hereward would submit heshould have his lands in Bourne and a free pardon for himself and allhis comrades.To which message Sir Ascelin and Ivo Taillebois not being over desirousof having Hereward as a neighbour saw fit to add a clause exemptingTorfrida from the amnesty but that she should be burnt on account ofher abominable and notorious sorceries.When the proclamation arrived Hereward was away foraging. He came back
comment904,in hot haste when he heard of it but not fast enough for ere they werein sight of the minster tower they were aware of a horse gallopingviolently towards them through the dusk and on its back were Torfridaand her daughter. The monks had surrendered the island rather than losetheir lands.The French were already in Ely.And now is Hereward to the greenwood gone to be a bold outlaw and thefather of all outlaws who held those forests for two hundred years fromthe Fens to the Scottish border and with some four hundred men heranged up the Bruneswald dashing out to the war cry of "A Wake AWake" and laying waste with fire and sword that is such towns as werein the hands of Frenchmen.Now Hereward had been faithful to Torfrida a virtue most rare in thosedays and he loved her with an overwhelming adoration--as all true menlove. And for that very reason he was the more aware that his feelingfor Alftruda was strangely like his feeling for Torfrida and yetstrangely different. Wherefore when it befell that once on a day therecame riding to Hereward in the Bruneswald a horseman who handed to him aletter the sight of Alftruda's signature at the end sent a strangethrill through him. There was naught in it that he should not haveread--it was but to tell him that the French were upon him the _possecomitatus_ of seven counties were rising and so forth. Continuing theletter told him that Dolfin had been slain on the Border and Williamand Gilbert of Ghent were going to marry her to Ascelin and thathaving saved her twice she feared that Hereward could not save her athird time concluding with an entreaty to submit to William hintingthat an opportunity presented itself now which might never recur.The messenger took back the answer. "Tell your lady that I kiss herhands and feet that I cannot write for outlaws carry no pen or ink.But that what she has commanded that will I perform." Having showed theletter to Torfrida they agreed that it were well to take precautionsand withdrew into the heart of the forest.Alftruda's warning was both timely and true for anon came IvoTaillebois who had taken to wife Hereward's niece Lucia and AbbotThorold of Peterborough who had an old score to wipe off in connectionwith Hereward's last visit to his abbey and Sir Ascelin his nephewand many another. And they rode gaily through the greenwood wherepresently they found Hereward to their sorrow for of their number somereturned home only after payment of ransom and others never returned atall. And of the former were Abbot Thorold and Ascelin and the ransomthat Hereward exacted for those two was thirty thousand silver marks.Whereby Hereward was enabled to put a spoke in Ascelin's wheel."Eh How most courteous victor" said Sir Ascelin."Sir Ascelin is not a very wealthy gentleman"Ascelin laughed assent."_Nudus intravi nudus exeo_--England and I fear now this mortal lifelikewise.""But he looked to his rich uncle the abbot to further a certain marriageproject of his. And of course neither my friend Gilbert of Ghent normy enemy William of Normandy are likely to give away so rich anheiress without some gratification in return."_IV.--The Last of the English_Thereafter they lived for two years in the forest and neither Torfridanor Hereward was the better for them. Hope deferred maketh the heartsick and a sick heart is but too apt to be a peevish one. So there werefits of despondency jars mutual recriminations. Furthermore thatfirst daughter was Torfrida's only child and she knew almost as well ashe how hard that weighed on Hereward. In him the race of Leofric ofGodiva of Earl Oslac would become extinct and the girl wouldmarry--whom Who but some French conqueror or at best some Englishoutlaw What wonder if he longed for a son to pass his name down tofuture generationsAnd one day Martin Lightfoot came with another letter to Hereward whichhe delivered to Torfrida who learned from him that it came fromAlftruda. She bade him deliver it to Hereward to whom it was addressedthe which he did but she noticed that this letter Hereward nevermentioned to her as he had done the former.
comment905,A month later Martin came again."There is another letter come it came last night" said he."What is that to thee or me My lord has his state secrets. Is it for usto pry into them Go.""I thought--I thought--""Go I say"There was a noise of trampling horses outside. The men were arming andsaddling and Hereward went with them saying that he would be back inthree days.After he had gone she found close to where his armour had hung aletter from Alftruda. It congratulated Hereward on having shaken himselffree from the fascinations of "that sorceress." It said that all wassettled with King William Hereward was to come to Winchester. She hadthe king's writ for his safety ready to send to him the king wouldreceive him as his liegeman. Alftruda would receive him as her husband.Archbishop Lanfranc had made difficulties about the dissolution of hismarriage with Torfrida but gold would do all things at Rome and soforth.When this was read after a night of frenzy to Crowland Torfrida wentunder the guidance of Martin and laid her head upon the knees of theLady Godiva."I am come as you always told me I should do. But it has been a longway hither and I am very tired."And at Crowland remained Martin donning a lay brother's frock that hemight the better serve his mistress. And to Crowland after three dayscame Leofric the renegade priest who had been with Hereward in thegreenwood and with him the child.And so it came that when Hereward returned as he had said after threedays he found neither wife nor child and to Crowland he too went butcame away even as he had gone. But with Torfrida he had no word norwith Godiva for both refused him audience.So Hereward went to Winchester and with him forty of his knights andplaced his hands between the hands of William and swore to be his man.And William walked out of the hall leaning on Hereward's shoulder atwhich all the Normans gnashed their teeth with envy.And thereafter Hereward married Alftruda after the scruples of HolyChurch had been duly set at rest.Then Hereward lived again at Bourne and tried to bring forgetfulness bydrink--and drink brought boastfulness for that he had no more thespirit left to do great deeds he must needs babble of the great deedswhich he had done and hurl insult and defiance at his Normanneighbours. And in the space of three years he had become as intolerableto those same neighbours as they were intolerable to him and he wasfain to keep up at Bourne the same watch and ward that he had kept up inthe forest.And Judith came to Bourne and besought Alftruda to accompany her toCrowland where she would visit the tomb of Waltheof her husband. AndAlftruda went with her taking a goodly company of knights to be herescort while Hereward remained at Bourne with few to guard it.
comment906,And knowing this to Bourne came Ascelin and Taillebois Evermue Raoulde Dol and many another Norman and burst in upon Hereward in some suchfashion as he had done himself some ten years earlier. "Felons" heshouted "your king has given me his truce Is this your French law Isthis your French honour Come on traitors all and get what you can ofa naked man you will buy it dear. Guard my back Winter"And with his constant comrade at his back he dashed right at the pressof knights    And when his lance did break in hand    Full fell enough he smote with brand.And now he is all wounded and Winter who fought at his back is fallenon his face and Hereward stands alone within a ring of eleven corpses.A knight rushes in to make a twelfth cloven through the helm but withthe blow Hereward's blade snaps short and he hurls it away as his foesrush in. With his shield he beat out the brains of two but nowTaillebois and Evermue are behind him and with four lances through hisback he falls to rise no more.So perished the last of the English.                                   Hypatia     In "Hypatia" published in 1853 after passing through     "Fraser's Magazine" Kingsley turned from social problems in     England to life in Egypt in the fifth century taking the same     pains to give the historical facts of the old dying Roman     world as he did to describe contemporary events at home. The     moral of "Hypatia" according to its author is that "the sins     of these old Egyptians are yours their errors yours their     doom yours their deliverance yours. There is nothing new     under the sun."_I.--The Laura_In the 413th year of the Christian era some 300 miles from Alexandriathe young monk Philammon was sitting on the edge of a low range ofinland cliffs crested with drifting sand. Behind him the desert sandwaste stretched lifeless interminable reflecting its lurid blare onthe horizon of the cloudless vault of blue. Presently he rose andwandered along the cliffs in search of fuel for the monastery fromwhence he came for Abbot Pambo's laura at Scetis.It lay pleasantly enough that lonely laura or lane of rude Cyclopeancells under the perpetual shadow of the southern walls of crags amidits grove of ancient date-trees. And a simple happy gentle life wasthat of the laura all portioned out by rules and methods. Each man hadfood and raiment shelter on earth friends and counsellors livingtrust in the continual care of Almighty God. Thither had they fled outof cities out of a rotten dying world of tyrants and slaveshypocrites and wantons to ponder undisturbed on duty and on judgmenton death and eternity.But to Philammon had come an insatiable craving to know the mysteries oflearning to see the great roaring world of men. He felt he could stayno longer and on his return he poured out his speech to Abbot Pambo."Let me go I am not discontented with you but with myself. I knew thatobedience is noble but danger is nobler still. If you have seen theworld why should not I Cyril and his clergy have not fled from it."Abbot Pambo sought counsel with the good brother Aufugus and then badePhilammon follow him."And thou wouldst see the world poor fool Thou wouldst see the world"said the old man when the abbot had left them alone together."I would convert the world""Thou must know it first. Here I sit the poor unknown old monk until Idie. And shall I tell thee what that world is like I was Arseniustutor of the emperor. There at Byzantium I saw the world which thouwouldst see and what I saw thou wilt see. Bishops kissing the feet of
comment907,parricides. Saints tearing saints in pieces for a word. Falsehood andselfishness spite and lust confusion seven times confounded. And thouwouldst go into the world from which I fled""If the harvest be at hand the Lord needs labourers. Send me and letthat day find me where I long to be in the forefront of the battle ofthe Lord.""The Lord's voice be obeyed. Thou shalt go. Here are letters to Cyrilthe patriarch. Thou goest of our free will as well as thine own. Theabbot and I have watched thee long knowing that the Lord had need ofsuch as thee elsewhere. We did but prove thee to see by thy readinessto obey whether thou were fit to rule. Go and God be with thee. Covetno man's gold or silver. Neither eat flesh nor drink wine but live asthou hast lived--a Nazarite of the Lord. The papyrus boat lies at theferry thou shalt descend in it. When thou hast gone five days' journeydownward ask for the mouth of the canal of Alexandria. Once in thecity any monk will guide thee to the archbishop. Send us news of thywelfare by some holy mouth. Come."Silently they paced together down the glen to the lonely beach of thegreat stream. Pambo was there and with slow and feeble arms he launchedthe canoe. Philammon flung himself at the old men's feet and besoughttheir blessing and their forgiveness."We have nothing to forgive. Follow thou thine inward call. If it be theflesh it will avenge itself if it be of the Spirit who are we that weshould fight against God Farewell"A few minutes more and the youth and his canoe were lessening down therapid stream in the golden summer twilight._II.--Hypatia Queen of Paganism_On his first morning in Alexandria Philammon heard praises of Hypatiafrom a fruit porter who showed him the way to the archbishop's house.Hypatia according to his guide was the queen of Alexandria a veryunique and wonderful person the fountain of classic wisdom.Later in the day after he had presented himself to Archbishop CyrilPhilammon learnt from an old priest and from a fanatical monk namedPeter that the very name of Hypatia was enough to rouse the clergy to afury of execration. It seemed that Orestes the Roman governor of thecity although nominally a Christian was the curse of the AlexandrianChurch and Orestes visited Hypatia whose lectures on heathenphilosophy drew all the educated youth of the place.Philammon's heart burned to distinguish himself at once. There were noidols now to break but there was philosophy."Why does not some man of God go boldly into the lecture-room of thesorceress and testify against her" he asked."Do it yourself if you dare" said Peter. "We have no wish to get ourbrains knocked out by all the profligate young gentlemen in the city.""I will do it" said Philammon.
comment908,The archbishop gave permission."Only promise me two things" he said. "Promise me that whateverhappens you will not strike the first blow and that you will not arguewith her. Contradict denounce defy. But give no reasons. If you do youare lost. She is subtler than the serpent skilled in all the tricks oflogic and you will became a laughing-stock and run away in shame.""Ay" said Peter bitterly as he ushered Philammon out. "Go up toRamoth Gilead and prosper young fool Ay go and let her convert you.Touch the accursed thing like Achan and see if you do not end byhaving it in your tent."And with this encouraging sentence the two parted and Philammon on thefollowing morning followed the train of philosophers students andfine gentlemen to Hypatia's lecture-room.Philammon listened to Hypatia in bewilderment attracted by the beautyof the speaker the melody of her voice and the glitter of herrhetoric. As she discoursed on truth a sea of new thoughts and questionscame rushing in on his acute Greek intellect at every sentence. Ahostile allusion to the Christian Scriptures aroused him and he criedout "It is false blasphemous The Scriptures cannot lie"There was a yell at this. "Turn the monk out" "Throw the rustic throughthe window" cried a dozen young gentlemen. Several of the most valiantbegan to scramble over the benches up to him and Philammon wascongratulating himself on the near approach of a glorious martyrdomwhen Hypatia's voice calm and silvery stifled the noise and tumult ina moment."Let the youth listen gentlemen. He is but a monk and a plebeian andknows no better he has been taught thus. Let him sit here quietly andperhaps we may be able to teach him otherwise."And without even a change of tone she continued her lecture.Philammon sprang up the moment that the spell of her voice was taken offhim and hurried out through the corridor into the street. But he hadnot gone fifty yards before his friend the fruit porter breathless withrunning told him that Hypatia called for him. "Thereon her fathercommands thee to be at her house--here--to-morrow at the third hour.Hear and obey."Cyril heard Philammon's story and Hypatia's message with a quiet smileand then dismissed the youth to an afternoon of labour in the citycommanding him to come for his order in the evening.But in the evening Peter already jealous of Cyril's interest inPhilammon and enraged at any toleration being extended to Hypatiarefused to let the youth enter the archbishop's house and then struckhim full in the face. The blow was intolerable and in an instantPeter's long legs were sprawling on the pavement while he bellowed likea bull to all the monks that stood by "Seize him The traitor Theheretic He holds communion with heathens And he was in Hypatia'slecture-room this morning"A rush took place at the youth but Philammon's blood was up. The ringof monks were baying at him like hounds round a bear and against suchodds the struggle would be desperate. He turned and forced his way tothe gate amid a yell of derision which brought every drop of blood inhis body into his cheeks."Let me leave this court in safety God knows whether I am a hereticand the archbishop shall know of your iniquity. I will not cross thisthreshold again until Cyril himself sends for me to shame you"He strode on in his wrath some hundred yards or more before he askedhimself where he was going. Gradually one fixed idea began to glimmerthrough the storm--to see Hypatia and convert her. He had Cyril's leave.It must be right. That would justify him--to bring back in the fettersof the Gospel the Queen of Heathendom. Yes there was that left to live
comment909,for._III.--Pandemonium_Philammon did not convert Hypatia but he became her favourite pupil.And Hypatia dreaming that the worship of the old gods might berestored and her philosophy triumph over Christianity received dailyvisits from Orestes the governor and entered into his plans--to herundoing.For Orestes had an idea of becoming emperor and of purchasing thefavour of the populace by a show of gladiators. To win Hypatia forhimself he promised to restore the heathen games and Hypatia caringnothing for Orestes but always longing for the revival of the oldreligion promised against her better judgment to bear him company onthe day of the festival and to sit by his side and even to acclaim himemperor.The success of Orestes' plot depended on the success of a biggerrebellion--the attempt of Heraclian Count of Africa to conquer Rome.Heraclian had been defeated and this was known to Cyril but Oresteswas misled by false intelligence and counted on Heraclian's victory forhis own triumph.When the day of the spectacle arrived to the horror and surprise ofPhilammon Hypatia herself sat by the side of the Roman prefect whileon the stage before them a number of Libyan prisoners fought fiercelyfor their lives only to be butchered in the end by the professionalgladiators.The sleeping devil in the hearts of the brutalised multitude burst forthat the sight and with jeers and applause the hired ruffians were urgedon to their work of blood.Then a shameless exhibition of Venus followed and Philammon could bearno more. For Venus was his sister long parted from him in childhoodand only in the last few days had he learnt of his relationship toPelagia the lady who had consented to act the part of the Goddess ofLove and who was betrothed to Amal the leader of the band of Goths. Herushed down through the dense mass of spectators leaped the balustradeinto the orchestra below and tore across to the foot of the stage."Pelagia Sister My sister Have mercy on me On yourself I will hideyou Save you We will flee together out of this infernal place I amyour brother Come"She looked at him one moment with wide wild eyes. The truth flashed onher. And she sprang from the platform into his arms and then coveringher face with both her hands sank down among the bloodstained sand.A yell ran along the vast circle. Philammon was hurried away by the
comment910,attendants and Pelagia her face still hidden by her hands walkedslowly away and vanished among the palms at the back of the stage. Acloud whether of disgust or disappointment now hung upon every browand there was open murmuring at the cruelty and heathenry of the show.Hypatia was utterly unnerved. Orestes alone rose to the crisis.In a well-studied oration he declared that Heraclian the African wasconquerer of Rome and a roar of hired applause supported him. Then theprefect of the guards encouraged the city authorities to salute Orestesas emperor and Hypatia amid shouts of her aristocratic scholars roseand knelt before him writhing inwardly with shame and despair.At the same moment a monk's voice shouted from the highest tiers in thetheatre "It is false False You are tricked Heraclian was utterlyrouted Cyril has known it every Jew has known it for a week past. Soperish all the enemies of the Lord caught in their own snare"For a minute an awful silence fell on all who heard and then arose atumult which Orestes in vain attempted to subdue. The would-be emperorsummoned his guards around him and Hypatia and made his way out as besthe could while the multitude melted away like snow before the rain tofind every church placarded by Cyril with the particulars of Heraclian'sruin.Two days later when Hypatia went to give her farewell lecture to herpupils--for all hope was dead--a mob of monks and their followers seizedher dragged her into the church of the Caesareum and there before thegreat still figure of Christ Peter struck her down and the mob toreher limb from limb._IV.--Back to the Desert_Philammon had done his best struggling in vain to pierce the densemass of people and save Hypatia. He had been wedged against a pillarunable to move in the great church.The little fruit porter alone of all her disciples fought his waythrough the mob only to be thrown down the steps.When all was over in the church and Hypatia was dead and the mob hadrushed out Philammon sank down exhausted outside and the little porterburst out into a bitter agony of human tears."She is with the gods" said the porter at last."She is with the God of gods" answered Philammon.Then he felt that he must arise and flee for his life. He had gone forthto see the world and he had seen it. Arsenius was in the right afterall. Home to the desert. But first he would go himself alone and findPelagia and implore her to flee with him.                                   
comment911,Abbot Pambo as well as Arsenius had been dead several years theabbot's place was filled by his own dying command by a hermit from theneighbouring deserts who had made himself famous for many miles roundby his extraordinary austerities his ceaseless prayers and his lovingwisdom.While still in the prime of his manhood he was dragged against his ownentreaties to preside over the laura of Scetis. The elder monksconsidered it an indignity to be ruled by so young a man but themonastery throve and grew rapidly under his government. His sweetnesspatience and humility and above all his marvellous understanding ofthe doubts and temptations of his own generation soon drew around himall whose sensitiveness or waywardness had made them unmanageable in theneighbouring monasteries.Never was the young Abbot Philammon heard to speak harshly of any humanbeing and he stopped by stern rebuke any attempt to revile eitherheretics or heathens.One thing was noted that there mingled always with his prayers thenames of two women. And when some worthy elder taking courage from hisyears dared to hint kindly that this caused some scandal to the weakerbrethren "It is true" answered he. "Tell my brethren that I praynightly for two women both of them young both of them beautiful bothof them beloved by me more than I love my own soul and tell them thatone of the two was an actress and the other a heathen." The old monklaid his hand on his mouth and retired.The remainder of his history it seems better to extract from anunpublished fragment of the lives of the saints."Now when the said abbot had ruled the monastery of Scetis seven yearswith uncommon prudence he called one morning to him a certain ancientbrother and said 'Make ready for me the divine elements that I mayconsecrate them and partake thereof with all my brethren ere I departhence. For know assuredly that within the seventh day I shall migrateto the celestial mansions.' And the abbot having consecrateddistributed among his brethren reserving only a portion of the mostholy bread and wine and then having bestowed on them all the kiss ofpeace he took the paten and chalice in his hands and went forth fromthe monastery towards the desert whom the whole fraternity followedweeping. And having arrived at the foot of a certain mountain hestopped and blessing them dismissed them and so ascending was taken
comment912,away from their eyes."But the eldest brother sent two of the young men to seek their masterwho meeting with a certain Moorish people learnt that a priestbearing a paten and chalice had passed before them a few days beforecrossing the desert in the direction of the cave of the holy Amma."And they inquiring who this Amma might be the Moors answered that sometwenty years ago there had arrived in those mountains a woman morebeautiful than had ever before been seen in that region who afterdistributing among them the rich jewels which she wore had embraced thehermit's life and sojourned upon the highest peak of a neighbouringmountain."Then the two brothers determining to proceed arrived upon the summitof the said mountain."There in an open grave guarded by two lions lay the body ofPhilammon the abbot and by his side wrapped in his cloak the corpseof a woman of exceeding beauty such as the Moors had described. And bythe grave-side stood the paten and the chalice emptied of their divinecontents. Whereupon filling in the grave with all haste they returnedweeping to the laura."Now before they returned one of the brethren searching the cavewherein the holy woman dwelt found nothing there saving one braceletof gold of large size and strange workmanship engraven with foreigncharacters which no one could decipher."And it came to pass years afterwards that certain wandering barbariansof the Vandalic race saw this bracelet in the laura of Scetis andpretended that it had belonged to a warrior of their tribe."                                   So be it. Pelagia and Philammon like the rest went to their own placeto the only place where such in such days could find rest to the desertand the hermit's cell.Let him that is without sin among you cast the first stone whether atHypatia or Pelagia Cyril or Philammon.                                   Two Years Ago     Kingsley's "Two Years Ago" has been said by his son to be the     only novel pure and simple that ever came from the pen of     the famous writer Published in 1857 it was begun two years     earlier while staying at Bideford. At this time Kingsley was     deeply interested in the Crimean War and many thousands of     copies of his pamphlet "Brave Words to Brave Soldiers" were     distributed to the army. His military tastes no doubt go a     long way towards explaining his doctrine in "Two Years Ago"     that the war was to exercise a great regenerating influence in     English life. Although the story is in many respects weaker     than its predecessors it nevertheless abounds in brilliant     and vivid word-paintings the descriptions of North Devon     scenery being probably unsurpassed in English prose._I.--Tom Thurnall's Wanderings_To tell my story I must go back sixteen years to the days when thepleasant old town of Whitbury boasted of forty coaches a day instead ofone railway and set forth how there stood two pleasant houses side byside in its southern suburb.In one of these two houses lived Mark Armsworth banker solicitor landagent and justice of the peace. In the other lived Edward Thurnallesquire doctor of medicine and consulting physician of all thecountryside. These two men were as brothers both were honest andkind-hearted men.Dr. Thurnall was sitting in his study settled to his microscope onebeautiful October morning and his son Tom stood gazing out of the baywindow.Tom who had been brought up in his father's profession was of thatbull-terrier type so common in England sturdy middle-sizeddeep-chested broad-shouldered his face full of shrewdness and goodnature and of humour withal. It was his last day at home tomorrow hewas leaving for Paris.Presently Mark Armsworth came in and Tom was seen cantering about thegarden with a weakly child of eight in his arms."Mark the boy's heart cannot be in the wrong place while he is so fond
comment913,of little children.""If she grows up doctor and don't go to join her poor dear mother upthere I don't know that I'd wish her a better husband than your boy.""It would be a poor enough match for her.""Tut She'll have the money and he the brains. Doctor that boy'll be acredit to you he'll make a noise in the world or I know nothing. Andif his fancy holds seven years hence and he wants still to turntraveller let him. If he's minded to go round the world I'll back himto go somehow or I'll eat my head Ned Thurnall"So Tom carried Mary about all the morning and next day went to Parisand soon became the best pistol shot and billiard-player in the QuartierLatin. Then he went to St. Mumpsimus's Hospital in London and becamethe best boxer therein and captain of the eight-oar besides winningprizes and certificates without end and becoming in time the mostpopular house-surgeon in the hospital but nothing could keep himpermanently at home. Settle down in a country practice he would not.Cost his father a farthing he would not. So he started forth into thewide world with nothing but his wits and his science an anatomicalprofessor to a new college in some South American republic.Unfortunately when he got there he found that the annual revolutionhad just taken place and that the party who had founded the college hadall been shot. Whereat he whistled and started off again no man knewwhither."Having got round half the world daddy" he wrote home "it's hard if Idon't get round the other half."With which he vanished into infinite space and was only heard of byoccasional letters dated from the Rocky Mountains the Spanish WestIndies Otaheite Singapore the Falkland Islands and all manner ofunexpected places sending home valuable notes zoological andbotanical.At last when full four years were passed and gone since Tom started forSouth America he descended from the box of the day-mail at Whitburywith a serene and healthful countenance shouldered his carpet-bag andstarted for his father's house.He walked in and hung up his hat in the hall just as if he had come infrom a walk. Not finding the old man he went into Mark Armsworth'sfrightening out of her wits a pale ugly girl of seventeen whom hediscovered to be his old playfellow Mary. However she soon recoveredher equanimity and longed to throw her arms round his neck as of oldand was only restrained by the thought that she was grown a great girlnow. She called her father and all the household and after a while theold doctor came home and the fatted calf was killed and all made merryover the return of this altogether unrepentant prodigal son.Tom Thurnall stayed a month at home and then went to America whence hewrote home in about six months. Then came a long silence and then aletter from California and then letters more regularly from Australia.Sickened with California life he had crossed the Pacific once more andwas hard at work in the diggings doctoring and gold-finding by turns."A rolling stone gathers no moss" said his father."He has the pluck of a hound and the cunning of a fox" said Mark "andhe'll be a credit to you yet."So the years slipped on till the autumn of 1853. And then Tom at thediggings at Ballarat got a letter from Mary Armsworth."Your father is quite well in health but his eyes have grown muchworse and the doctors are afraid that he has little chance ofrecovering the sight at least of the left eye. And something hashappened to the railroad in which he had invested so much and he hasgiven up the old house. He wants you to come home but my father hasentreated him to let you stay. You know while we are here he is safe."Tom walked away slowly into the forest. He felt that the crisis of hislife was come."I'll stay here and work" he said to himself finally "till I make ahit or luck runs dry and then home and settle and meanwhile I'll go
comment914,down to Melbourne tomorrow and send the dear old dad two hundredpounds."And there sprang up in him at once the intensest yearning after hisfather and the haunts of his boyhood and the wildest dread that heshould never see them._II.--The Wreck_Half the village of Aberalva is collected on the long sloping point of acliff. Sailors wrapped in pilot-cloth oil-skinned coast guardsmenwomen with their gowns turned over their heads while every moment somefresh comer stumbles down the slope and asks "Where's the wreck" Ashift of wind a drift of cloud and the moon flashes out a moment."There she is sir" says Brown the head-boatman to the coastguardlieutenant.Some three hundred yards out at sea lies a long curved black lineamid the white wild leaping hills of water. A murmur from the crowd."A Liverpool clipper by the lines of her.""God help the poor passengers then" sobs a woman. "They're past ourhelp."A quarter of an hour passes."God have mercy" shouts Brown. "She's going"The black curve coils up and then all melts away into the whiteseething waste.The coastguard lieutenant settles down in his macintoshes knowing thathis duty is not to leave as long as there is a chance of saving--not alife for that was past all hope but a chest of clothes or a stick oftimber.And with the coastguardsmen many sailors stayed. Old Captain Willisstays because Grace Harvey the village schoolmistress is theresitting upon a flat slope of rock a little apart from the rest withher face resting on her hands gazing intently out into the wild waste."She's not one of us" says old Willis. "There's no saying what's goingon there in her. Maybe she's praying maybe she sees more than we doover the sea there.""Look at her now What's she after" Brown replies.The girl had raised her head and was pointing toward the sea. Then shesprang to her feet with a scream."A man A man Save him"As she spoke a huge wave rolled in and out of it struggled on handsand knees a human figure. He looked wildly up and around and layclinging with outstretched arms over the edge of the rock."Save him" she shrieked again as twenty men rushed forward--andstopped short. The man was fully thirty yards from them but betweenthem and him stretched a long ghastly crack some ten feet wide with
comment915,seething cauldrons within.Ere they could nerve themselves for action the wave had comehalf-burying the wretched mariner and tearing across the chasm.The schoolmistress took one long look and as the wave retired rushedafter it to the very brink of the chasm and flung herself on her knees."The wave has carried him across the crack and she's got him" screamedold Willis. And he sprang upon her and caught her round the waist."Now if you be men" shouted he as the rest hurried down."Now if you be men before the next wave comes" shouted big Jan thefisherman. "Hands together and make a line" And he took a grip withone hand of the old man's waistband and held out the other for whowould to seize.Strong hand after hand was clasped and strong knee after knee droppedalmost to the rock to meet the coming rush of water.It came and surged over the man and the girl and up to old Willis'sthroat and round the knees of Jan and his neighbour and then followedthe returning out-draught and every limb quivered under the strain butwhen the cataract had disappeared the chain was still unbroken."Saved" and a cheer broke from all lips save those of the girlherself--she was as senseless as he whom she had saved.Gently they lifted each and laid them on the rock and presently theschoolmistress was safe in bed at her mother's house. And the man weakbut alive had been carried triumphantly up to the door of Dr. Healewhich having been kicked open the sailors insisted on carrying himright upstairs and depositing him on the best spare bed saying "Ifyou won't come to your patients doctor your patients shall come toyou."The man grumbled when he awoke next morning at being thrown ashore withnothing in the world but an old jersey and a bag of tobacco two hundredmiles short of the port where he hoped to land with 1500 in hispocket.To Dr. Heale and to the Rev. Frank Headley the curate who called uponhim he mentioned that his name was Tom Thurnall F.R.C.S.Later in the day Tom met the coastguard lieutenant and old CaptainWillis on the shore and the latter introduced him to "Miss Harvey theyoung person who saved your life last night."Tom was struck by the beauty of the girl at once but after thankingher said gently "I wish to tell you something which I do not wantpublicly talked of but in which you may help me. I had nearly 1500about me when I came ashore last night sewed in a belt round my waist.It is gone."Grace turned pale and her lips quivered. She turned to her mother andCaptain Willis."Belt Mother Uncle What is this The gentleman has lost a belt""Dear me A belt Well child that's not much to grieve over when theLord has spared his life" said her mother somewhat testily.Grace declared the money should be found and Tom vowed to himself hewould stay in that little Cornish village of Aberalva until he hadrecovered it.So after writing to some old friends at St. Mumpsimus's Hospital to sendhim down some new drugs and to his father he settled down as Dr.Heale's assistant and Dr. Heale being addicted to brandy and waterthere was plenty of room for assistance._III.--The Cholera_Tom Thurnall had made up his mind in June 1854 that the cholera oughtto visit Aberalva in the course of the summer and of course tried hisbest to persuade people to get ready for their ugly visitor but invain. The collective ignorance pride laziness and superstition of thelittle town showed a terrible front to the newcomer."Does he think we was all fools afore he came here"That was the rallying cry of the enemy and sanitary reform was thrustout of sight.But Lord Minchampstead who owned the neighbouring estates ofPentremochyn on Mark Armsworth's advice got Tom to make a report onthe sanitary state of his cottages and then acted on the information.
comment916,Frank Headley backed up Tom in his sanitary crusade the coastguardlieutenant proved an unexpected ally and Grace Harvey promised that shewould do all she could.Tom wrote up to London and detailed the condition of the place to theGeneral Board of Health and the Board returned for answer that assoon as cholera broke out in Aberalva they would send down aninspector.Then in August it came and Tom Beer the fisherman and one of thefinest fellows in the town was dead after two hours' illness.Up and down the town the foul fiend sported now here now therefleshing his teeth on every kind of prey. He has taken old Beer's secondson and now clutches at the old man himself then across the street toJan Beer his eldest but he is driven out from both houses by chlorideof lime and the colony of the Beers has peace awhile. The drunkencobbler dies of course but spotless cleanliness and sobriety do notsave the mother of seven children who has been soaking her brick floordaily with water from a poisoned well defiling where she meant toclean. Youth does not save the buxom lass who has been filling herselfwith unripe fruit.And yet sots and fools escape where wise men fall weakly women livingamid all wretchedness nurse unharmed strong men who have breathedfresh air all day.Headley and Grace and old Willis and last but not least Tom Thurnallthese and three or four brave women organised themselves into a bandand commenced at once a visitation from house to house saving therebymany a life. But within eight-and-forty hours it was as much as theycould do to attend to the acute cases.Grace often longed to die but knew that she should not die till she hadfound Tom's belt and was content to wait.Tom just thought nothing about death and danger at all but alwayscheerful always busy yet never in a hurry went up and down seeminglyubiquitous. Sleep he got when he could and food as often as he couldinto the sea he leapt morning and night and came out fresher everytime the only person in the town who seemed to grow healthier andactually happier as the work went on in that fearful week.The battle is over at last and Tom is in London at the end ofSeptember ready to go to war as medical officer to the Turks. The newsof Alma has just arrived.But he pays a visit to Whitbury first and there Lord Minchampstead seeshim and his lordship expresses satisfaction at the way Tom conductedthe business at Pentremochyn and offers him a post of queen's messengerin the Crimea which Tom accepts with profuse thanks.Before Tom left for the East old Mark Armsworth took him aside andsaid "What do you think of the man who marries my daughter""I should think" quoth Tom wondering who the happy man could be "thathe would be lucky in possessing such a heart.""Then be as good as your word and take her yourself. I've watched you
comment917,and you'll make her a good husband."Tom was too astonished and puzzled to reply. He had never thought thathe had found such favour in his old playfellow Mary Armsworth's eyes.It was a terrible temptation. He knew the plain English of 50000 andMark Armsworth's daughter a good house a good consulting practiceand above all his father to live with him.And then rose up before his imagination the steadfast eyes of GraceHarvey and seemed to look through and through his inmost soul asthrough a home which belonged of right to her and where no other womanmust dwell or could dwell for she was there and he knew it and knewthat even if he never married till his dying day he should sell hissoul by marrying anyone but her.So Tom told old Mark it was impossible because he was in love withanother woman. And then just as he was packing up next morning came anote from Mark Armsworth and a cheque for 500 "To Thomas ThurnallEsq. for behaving like a gentleman." And Tom went Eastward Ho--twoyears ago._IV.--Christmas Eve_It was in September after Tom had left that Grace found the missingbelt. Her mother had hidden it in a cave on the shore and Gracefollowing her there came upon the hiding-place. The shock of detectionbrought out the disease against which Mrs. Harvey had taken so manyprecautions and within two days the unhappy woman was dead.Grace sold all her mother's effects paid off all creditors and with afew pounds left vanished from Aberalva. She had written at once to Tomat Whitbury telling him that his belt and money were safe but hadreceived no answer and now she went to Whitbury herself only to arrivea week after Tom had gone. Mark Armsworth and Mary kept her for a nightand she left Tom's money with the old banker retaining the belt andthen set out Eastward Ho too to nurse the wounded in the war and ifpossible to find Tom and clear her name of all suspicion.How Grace Harvey worked at Scutari and at Balaclava there is no need totell. Why mark her out from the rest when all did more than nobly Indue time she went home to England--home but not to Aberalva.She presented herself one day at Mark Armsworth's house in Whitbury andbegged him to obtain her a place as servant to old Dr. Thurnall. And bythe help of Mark and Mary Grace Harvey took up her abode in the oldman's house and ere a month was past she was to him a daughter.Mary loved her--wanted to call her sister but Grace drew back lovinglybut humbly from all advances for she had divined Mary's secret withthe quick eye of a woman. She saw how Mary grew daily paler sadder. Beit so Mary had a right to him and she had none.                                   And where was Tom Thurnall all the while No man could tell.Mark inquired Lord Minchampstead inquired great personages inquiredbut all in vain. A few knew and told Lord Minchampstead who told Markin confidence that he had been heard of last in the CircassianMountains about Christmas 1854 but since then all was blank.The old man never seemed to regret him and never mentioned his nameafter a while. None knew it was because he and Grace never talked ofanything else. So they had lived and so they had waited.And now it is the blessed Christmas Eve the light is failing fast whendown the High Street comes Mark's portly bulk. The next minute he hasentered the old doctor's house and is full of the afternoon's run forhe has been out fox-hunting.The old doctor is confident to-day that his son will return and Gracereassures him."Yes he is coming soon to us" she half whispers leaning over the oldman's chair. "Or else we are soon going to him. It may mean that sir.Perhaps it is better that it should.""It matters little child if he be near as near he is."And sure enough while Mark is telling of the good run he has had Tom'sfresh voice is heard. Yes There he was in bodily flesh and blood thinsallow bearded to the eyes dressed in ragged sailor's clothes.Grace uttered a long soft half laughing cry full of the delicious
comment918,agony of sudden relief and then slipped from the room past theunheeding Tom who had no eyes but for his father. Straight up to theold man he went took both his hands and spoke in the old cheerfulvoice."Well my dear old daddy I'm afraid I've made you very anxious but itwas not my fault and I knew you would be certain I should come at lasteh""My son my son" murmured the old man. "You won't go away again dearboy I'm getting old and forgetful and I don't think I could bear itagain you see.""Never again as long as I live daddy."Mark Armsworth burst out blubbering like a great boy."I said so I always said so The devil could not kill him and Godwouldn't.""Tom" said his father presently "you have not spoken to Grace yet. Sheis my daughter now Tom and has been these twelve months past.""If she is not she will be soon" said Tom quietly. With that hewalked straight out of the room to find Grace in the passage.And Grace lay silent in his arms.                                   Water-Babies     Charles Kingsley wrote "The Water-Babies a Fairy Tale for a     Land-Baby" under romantic circumstances. Reminded in 1862 of     a promise he had made that "Rose Maurice and Mary have got     their books the baby must have his" Kingsley produced the     story about little Tom which forms the first chapter in "The     Water-Babies" a fairy tale occupying a nook of its own in the     literature of fantasy for children. After running serially     through "Macmillan's Magazine" the "Water-Babies" was     published in book form in 1863 dedicated "To my youngest son     and to all other good little boys." Mrs. Kingsley in the life     of her husband says "that it was perhaps the last book that he     wrote with any real ease." The story with its irresponsible     and whimsical humour throws an altogether delightful light     upon the character of Charles Kingsley--clergyman lecturer     historian and social reformer._I.--"I Must be Clean"_Once upon a time there was a little chimney-sweep and his name was Tom.He lived in a great town in the North Country where there were plenty ofchimneys to sweep and plenty of money for Tom to earn and his drunkenmaster to spend. He could not read nor write and did not care to doeither and he never washed himself for there was no water up the courtwhere he lived. Chimney-sweeping and hunger and beatings he took allfor the way of the world and when his master let him have a pull at theleavings of his beer Tom was the jolliest boy in the whole town.One day Tom's master Mr. Grimes was sent for to sweep all thechimneys at Sir John Harthover's mansion Harthover Place.At four in the morning they passed through the silent town together andalong the peaceful country roads to Sir John's Mr. Grimes riding thedonkey in front and Tom and the brushes walking behind. On the way theycame up with an old Irishwoman limping slowly along and carrying aheavy bundle. She walked along with Tom and asked him many questionsabout himself and seemed very sad when he told her that he knew noprayers to say. She told him that she lived far away by the sea andhow the sea rolled and roared on winter nights and lay still in thebright summer days for the children to bathe and play in it and many astory more till Tom longed to go and see the sea and bathe in itlikewise.When at length they came to a spring Grimes got off his donkey torefresh himself by dipping his head in the water. Because Tom followedhis example his master immediately thrashed him."Are you not ashamed of yourself Thomas Grimes" said the Irishwoman.Grimes looked up startled at her knowing his name but he answered"No nor never was yet" and went on beating Tom."True for you. If you ever had been ashamed of yourself you would havegone into Vendale long ago.""What do you know about Vendale" shouted Grimes but he left offbeating Tom."I know about Vendale and about you too and if you strike that boyagain I can tell you what I know."Grimes seemed quite cowed and got on his donkey without another word."Stop" said the Irishwoman. "I have one more word for you both for you
comment919,will see me again. Those that wish to be clean clean they will be andthose that wish to be foul foul they will be. Remember."She turned away into a meadow and disappeared. And Tom and Grimes wenton their way. When they came to Harthover Place the housekeeper turnedthem into a grand room all covered up in sheets of brown paper. Up thechimney went Tom with a kick from his master.How many chimneys Tom swept I cannot say but he swept so many that hegot tired and puzzled too for they ran into one another so that hefairly lost his way in them. At last he came down. But it was the wrongchimney and he found himself in a room the like of which he had neverseen before. The room was all dressed in white white window-curtainswhite bed-curtains white furniture and white walls. There was awashhand-stand with ewers and basins and soap and brushes and towelsand a large bath full of clean water. What a heap of things--all forwashingAnd then he happened to look towards the bed and there lay the mostbeautiful little girl Tom had ever seen. He wondered whether all peoplewere as white as she when they were washed. Thinking of this he triedto rub some of the soot from his own wrist and thought perhaps hemight look better himself if he were clean.And looking round he suddenly saw a little ugly black figure withbleared eyes and grinning teeth. And behold it was himself reflected inthe mirror. With tears of shame and anger at the contrast he turned tosneak up the chimney and hide. But in his haste he upset the fire-irons.Up jumped the little white lady with a scream in rushed her nurse andmade a dash at Tom. But out of the window went he and down a tree andaway through the garden and the park into the wood beyond with thegardener the groom the dairymaid Grimes the steward the keeper SirJohn and the Irishwoman all in hot pursuit.Through the wood rushed Tom until he came to a wall where his quickwits enabled him to evade his pursuers--except the Irishwoman whofollowed him all the way although he never knew.At length he stood on a limestone rock which overhung a valley athousand feet below and down there he could see a little stream windingin and out and by the stream a cottage. It was a dangerous descent butdown went Tom without a moment's hesitation sick and giddy on he wentuntil at last he dropped on the grass and lay there unconscious. Butafter a time he roused himself and stumbled on to the cottage.
comment920,The old dame of the cottage took pity on him and laid him on a bed ofsweet hay. But Tom could not rest and think of the little white ladyhe found his way to the river murmuring. "I must be clean I must beclean"And still he had not seen the Irishwoman in front of him now for shehad stepped into the river just before Tom and had changed into themost beautiful of fairies underneath the water. For she was indeed theQueen of the Water-Fairies who were all waiting to receive her themoment she came back from the land-world.Tom was so hot and longed so to be clean for once that he tumbled asquick as he could into the cool stream. And he had not been in it half aminute before he fell into the quietest coolest sleep that ever he hadin his life. The reason of his falling into such a delightful sleep isvery simple. It was merely that the fairies took him. In fact theyturned him into a water-baby.Meanwhile of course the chase after Tom had come to an end althoughSir John and his keepers made a second search the next day for he feltsorry for the little sweep and was afraid he might have fallen oversome of the crags. They found the little fellow's rags by the side ofthe stream and they also discovered his body in the water and buriedit over in Vendale churchyard._II.--A Lonely Mischievous Water-Baby_Tom was very happy swimming about in the river although he was now onlyabout four inches long with a set of external gills just like those ofan eft. There are land-babies and why not water-babies Some peopletell us that water-babies are contrary to nature but there are so manythings in nature which we don't expect to find that there may as well bewater-babies as not.He was still as mischievous as any land-baby and made himself a perfectnuisance to the other creatures of the water teasing them as they wentabout their work until they were all afraid of him and got out of hisway or crept into their shells so that he had no one to speak to or toplay with.It was from a dragon-fly that he learned some valuable lessons in goodconduct. For all his short sight the dragon-fly had noticed a great manyinteresting things in nature about which Tom knew nothing and of whichhe heard with wonder. One day he might have been eaten by an otter butbehold seven little terrier dogs rushed at the otter and drove heroff much to Tom's relief though he did not guess that these werereally water-fairies sent to protect him.But before the otter had been headed off she had twitted Tom with beingonly an eft and told him he would be eaten by the salmon when they cameup from the sea--the great wide sea. Tom himself decided he would godown the stream and discover what the great wide sea was like.One night Tom noticed a curious light and heard voices of men comingfrom the bank of the river.Soon after a large salmon was speared. Then other men seemed to arrivethere were shouts and scufflings and then a tremendous splash and oneof the men fell into the river close to Tom. He lay so still that Tomthought the water must have sent him to sleep as it had done him so he
comment921,screwed up courage to go and look at him. The moonlight lit up the man'sface and Tom recognised his old master Grimes. Suppose he should turninto a water-baby But he lay quite still at the bottom of the pool andnever went poaching salmon any more.Every creature in the stream seemed to be hurrying down to the sea andTom being the only water-baby among all the squirming eels and thescores of different things big and little he had many strangeadventures before he came to the sea. But great was his disappointmentto find no water-babies there to play with though he asked thesea-snails and the hermit crabs and the sun-fish and the bass andthe porpoises. But though one fish told him that he had been helped theprevious night by the water-babies Tom could find no trace of them atall.Now one day it befell that on the rocks where Tom was sitting with alobster there walked the little lady Ellie herself and with her avery wise man Professor Pttmllnsprts who was a very great naturalist.He was showing her about one in ten thousand of all the beautiful andcurious things that are to be seen among the rocks. Presently as hegroped with his net among the weeds he caught poor Tom."Dear me" he cried "what a large pink Holothurian. It has actuallyeyes. Why it must be a Cephalopod""It is a water-baby" cried Ellie."Water-fiddlesticks my dear" said the professor sharply.Now Tom was in a most horrible fright and between fright and rage heturned to bay and bit the professor's finger."Oh Eh" cried he and dropped Tom on to the seaweed whence he wasgone in a moment."But it was a water-baby" cried Ellie. "Ah it is gone" And she jumpeddown off the rock. But she slipped and fell with her head on a sharprock and lay quite still.The professor picked her up and took her home and she was put to bed.But she would not waken at all and after a week one moonlight nightthe fairies came flying in at the window and brought her a pair ofwings. And she flew away and nobody heard or saw anything of her for along while._III.--In St. Brandon's Fairy Isle_After Tom slipped away into the water again he could not help thinkingof Ellie and longed to have her to play with for he had not succeededin finding any other water-babies. But soon he had something else tothink of. One day he helped a lobster caught in a lobster-pot to getfree and then five minutes after he came upon a real live water-babysitting on the white sand.And it ran to Tom and Tom ran to it and they hugged and kissed eachother for ever so long. At last Tom said. "Well this is wonderful Ihave seen things just like you again and again but I thought you were
comment922,shells or sea-creatures."Now was not this very odd So odd indeed that you will no doubtwant to know how it happened and why Tom could never find a water-babytill after he had got the lobster out of the pot. But if you will readthis story nine times over you will find out why. It is not good forlittle boys and girls to be told everything and never to be forced tomake use of their own wits."Now" said the baby "come and help me plant this rock which got allits flowers knocked off in the last storm or I shall not have finishedbefore my brothers and sisters come and it is now time to go home."So they worked away at the rock and planted it and smoothed the sanddown round it and capital fun they had till the tide began to turn. Andthen Tom heard all the other babies coming laughing and singing andromping and the noise they made was just like the noise of a ripple.And in they came dozens and dozens of them and when they found that hewas a new baby they hugged and kissed him. And there was no one ever sohappy as poor little Tom and he gaily swam away with them to their homein the caves beneath St. Brandan's fairy isle. But I wish Tom had givenup all his naughty tricks. He would meddle with the creatures frightenthe crabs and put stones in the anemones' mouths to make them fancydinner was coming.The other children warned him and said "Take care what you are at asMrs. Bedonebyasyoudid is coming on Friday."Early one Friday morning this tremendous lady came indeed. Very uglyTom thought her with her green spectacles on a great hooked nose and abig birch rod under her arm. She looked at all the children and seemedpleased with them for she gave sea-cakes or sea-lollipops to them all.At last Tom's turn came and she put something in his mouth and lo andbehold it was a cold hard pebble."Who put pebbles in the sea-anemones' mouths to make them fancy they hadcaught a good dinner As you did to them so I must do to you."Tom thought her very hard but she showed him she had to do it becauseit was her work. She told him too that she was the ugliest fairy inthe world and would be until people learned to behave as they shouldwhen she would grow as handsome as her sister Mrs.Doasyouwouldbedoneby the loveliest fairy in the world.Tom tried hard to be good on Saturday he did not frighten one crab norput one pebble into a sea-anemone's mouth.Sunday came and so did Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby. All the childrendanced round her for she had the sweetest merriest face Tom had everseen."He's the new water-baby" they informed the fairy. "He never had anymother.""Then I will be his mother" she said and took him in her arms. And Tomlooked up in her face and loved her and fell asleep for very love.When he awoke she was telling the children a story."Now" she said to Tom as she prepared to go "will you be good and
comment923,torment no sea-beasts until I come again"Tom promised and tormented no sea-beasts after that as long as helived and he is quite alive I assure you still._IV.--At the Other-End-of-Nowhere_Being happy and comfortable does not always mean being good and so itwas with Tom. He had everything he could wish for in St. Brandan's fairyisle. But now he had grown so fond of lollipops that he could think ofnothing else and longed to go to the cabinet where they were kept. Atlast he went to take just one then he had one more and another andanother until they were all gone. And all the while Mrs.Bedonebyasyoudid stood close behind him though he neither heard nor sawher.Tom was very surprised when she came again to see that she had just asmany lollipops as before. He thought therefore that she could not know.But he was very unhappy all that week and long after it too. Andbecause his conscience had been pricking him inside his outside grewhorny and prickly as well until he could bear it no longer and toldMrs. Bedonebyasyoudid all about it and asked her to take away theprickles. But she told him only he could do that that he must go toschool and she would fetch him a schoolmistress.Soon she returned with the most beautiful little girl that was everseen. Tom begged her to show him how to be good and get rid of hisprickles. So she began and taught him every day except on Sunday whenshe went away. In a short time all Tom's prickles had disappeared. Thenthe little girl knew him she said for the little chimney-sweep who hadcome into the bedroom."And I know you" said Tom "you are the little white lady I saw inbed." And then they began telling each other all their story. And thenthey set to work at their lessons again and both liked them so wellthat they went on till seven full years were past and gone.Tom began to be very curious to know where Ellie went on Sundays andwhy he could not go too."Those who go there" said Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid "must first learn togo where they do not want to go and to help someone they do not like."And Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby said the same. Tom was very unhappy now.He knew the fairy wanted him to go and help Grimes he did not want togo and was ashamed of himself for not going. But just when he wasfeeling most discontented Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid encouraged him until hewas quite anxious to seek for Grimes."Mr. Grimes is now at the Other-end-of-Nowhere" said the fairy. "To getthere you must go to Shiny Wall and through the White Gate which hasnever yet been opened. You will then be at Peacepool where you will
comment924,find Mother Carey who will direct you to the Other-end-of-Nowhere."Tom immediately set out to find his way to Shiny Wall asking the way ofall the birds and beasts he met. He at length received help from thepetrels who are Mother Carey's chickens and so reached Shiny Wall. Hewas dismayed to find that there was no gate but taking the birds'advice he dived underneath the wall and went along the bottom of thesea for seven days and seven nights until he arrived in Peacepool.There sat Mother Carey a marble lady on a marble throne--motionlessrestful gazing down into the depths of the sea.Following Mother Carey's directions Tom at length arrived at theOther-end-of-Nowhere after meeting with many strange adventures. He hadnot long arrived in this strange land when he was overtaken by severalpolicemen's truncheons one of which conducted him to the prison whereGrimes was quartered. Here on the roof his head and shoulders justshowing above the top of chimney No. 343 was poor Mr. Grimes with apipe that would not draw.He thought Tom had simply come to laugh at him until he assured him thathe had only come to help. Suddenly Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid appeared. Shereminded Grimes that he was only suffering now what he had inflicted onTom. She told him too how his mother had gone to heaven and would nomore weep for him. Gradually Grimes's heart softened and when Tomdescribed her kindness to him at Vendale Grimes wept. Then his tearsdid for him what his mother's could not do for as they fell they washedthe soot off his face and his clothes and loosened the mortar from thebricks of the chimney."Will you obey me if I give you a chance" said Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid."As you please ma'am. For I'm beat and that's the truth" said he."Be it so then--you may come out. But remember disobey me again andinto a worse place still you will go.""I beg your pardon ma'am but I never disobeyed you that I know of. Inever set eyes upon you until I came to these ugly quarters.""Never saw me Who said 'Those that will be foul foul they will be'"Grimes looked up and Tom looked up too for the voice was that of theIrishwoman who met them the day they went out together to Harthover. She
comment925,ordered Grimes to march off in the custody of the truncheon who was tosee that he devoted himself to the considerable task of sweeping out thecrater of Etna.Tom went back to St. Brandan's Isle and there found Ellie--grown into abeautiful woman. And he looked at her and she looked at him and theyliked the employment so much that they stood and looked for seven yearsmore and neither spoke nor stirred.At last they heard the fairy say "Attention children Are you nevergoing to look at me again"They looked and both of them cried out at once "You are our dear Mrs.Doasyouwouldbedoneby No you are good Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid but youare grown quite beautiful now.""To you" she said. "But look again.""You are Mother Carey" said Tom in a very low solemn voice. For hehad found out something which made him very happy and yet frightenedhim more than all that he had ever seen.And when they looked again she was neither of them and yet all of themat once."My name is written in my eyes if you have eyes to see it there."And her eyes flashed for one moment clear white blazing light butthe children could not read her name for they were dazzled and hidtheir faces in their hands."Not yet young things not yet" said she smiling. And then she turnedto Ellie."You may take him home with you on Sundays Ellie. He has won his spursin the great battle and become fit to be a man because he has done thething he did not like."                                   Westward Ho     "Westward Ho" was published in 1855 and on the whole may     be accepted as the most popular of all Charles Kingsley's     novels. It is a story full of the life and stir of Elizabethan     England and its heroes and heroines are the stout-hearted     Devonshire people whom Kingsley knew and loved so well. Like     most historical romances "Westward Ho" must not be accepted     as history in spite of the fact that its author was Regius     Professor of History at Cambridge. Kingsley's whole-hearted     and entirely creditable patriotism and his intense devotion to     the established Church of England prevented his doing justice     to Spain or looking with sympathy on Roman Catholicism. See     Newman Vol. XIII. Kingsley never could refrain from     preaching his own convictions and while this often interfered     with the art of the novelist it gave a note of sincerity to
comment926,     all his work and warmth and colour to his style._I.--How Amyas Came Home the First Time_One bright summer's afternoon in the year 1575 a tall and fair boy camelingering along Bideford Quay in his scholar's gown with satchel andslate in hand watching wistfully the shipping and the sailors tilljust after he had passed the bottom of the High Street he came to agroup of sailors listening earnestly to someone who stood in the midst.The boy all alive for any sea news must needs go up to them and socame in for the following speech delivered in a loud bold voice witha strong Devonshire accent."I tell you as I John Oxenham am a gentleman I saw it with theseeyes and so did Salvation Yeo there and we measured the heap seventyfoot long ten foot broad and twelve foot high of silver bars andeach bar between a thirty and forty pound weight. Come along Who listsWho lists Who'll make his fortune""Who'll list" cried a tall gaunt man whom the other had calledSalvation Yeo. "Now's your time We've got forty men to Plymouth nowready to sail the minute we get back and we want a dozen out of youBideford men and just a boy or two and then we'm off and away andmake our fortunes or go to heaven."Then the gaunt man pulled from under his arm a great white buffalo horncovered with rough etchings of land and sea.The horn was passed from hand to hand and the schoolboy got a nearersight of the marvel. To his astonished gaze displayed themselves citiesand harbours plate ships of Spain and islands with apes andpalm-trees and here and there over-written "Here is gold" and again"Much gold and silver." The boy turned it round and round anxious topossess this wonderful horn. And Oxenham asked him why he was so keenafter it."Because" said he looking up boldly "I want to go to sea. I want tosee the Indies. I want to fight the Spaniards." And the lad havinghurried out his say dropped his head."And you shall" cried Oxenham. "Whose son are you my gallant fellow""Mr. Leigh's of Burrough Court.""Bless his soul I know him as well as I do the Eddystone. Tell your
comment927,father John Oxenham will come and keep him company."The boy Amyas Leigh took his way homewards and that night JohnOxenham dined at Burrough Court but failed to get Mr. Leigh's leave totake young Amyas with him nor did Sir Richard Grenville the boy'sgodfather who was also at dinner help him with his suit.But somewhat more than a twelvemonth later Mr. Leigh going down onbusiness to Exeter Assizes caught--as was too common in those days--thegaol-fever from the prisoners sickened in the very court and diedwithin a week."You must be my father now sir" said young Amyas firmly to Sir RichardGrenville on the day after the funeral.And shortly afterwards Amyas having broken his slate on the head ofVindex Brimblecombe Sir Richard thought it well to go up to Burrough.And after much talk and many tears matters were so concluded thatAmyas Leigh found himself riding joyfully towards Plymouth and beinghanded over to Captain Drake vanished for three years from the goodtown of Bideford.And now he is returned in triumph and the observed of all observers.The bells of Bideford church cannot help breaking forth into a jocundpeal. Bideford streets are a very flower-garden of all the coloursswarming with seamen and burghers and burghers' wives and daughters allin their holiday attire. Garlands are hung across the streets andtapestries from every window. Every stable is crammed with horses andSir Richard Grenville's house is like a very tavern. Along the littlechurchyard streams all the gentle blood of North Devon and on into thechurch where all are placed according to their degrees not withoutshovings and whisperings from one high-born matron and another. At lastthere is a silence and a looking toward the door and then distantmusic which comes braying and screaming up to the very church doors. Whyare all eyes fixed on those four weather-beaten mariners decked outwith knots and ribbons by loving hands And yet more on that giganticfigure who walks before them a beardless boy and yet with the frameand stature of a Hercules towering like Saul of old a head andshoulders above all the congregation And why as the five fall on theirknees before the altar rails are all eyes turned to the pew where Mrs.Leigh of Burrough has hid her face between her hands and her hoodrustles and shakes to her joyful sobs Because there was fellow-feelingof old in country and in town. And these are Devon men and men ofBideford and they the first of all English mariners have sailed roundthe world with Francis Drake and are come to give God thanks._II.--The Brotherhood of the Rose_It was during the three years of Amyas's absence that Rose Salterne themotherless daughter of that honest merchant the Mayor of Bideford hadgrown into so beautiful a girl of eighteen that half North Devon was madabout the "Rose of Torridge" as she was called. There was not a younggallant for ten miles round who would not have gone to Jerusalem to winher and not a week passed but some nosegay or languishing sonnet wasconveyed into the Rose's chamber all of which she stowed away with thesimplicity of a country girl.Frank Leigh Amyas's elder brother who had won himself honour at homeand abroad and was the friend of Sir Philip Sidney and in favour at thecourt of Queen Elizabeth fell as deeply in love with the Rose when hecame home to rejoice over the return of Amyas as any young squire ofthe county.When the time came for him to set off again for London and for Amyas tojoin the queen's forces in Ireland where war was now raging Frank andAmyas concocted a scheme which was put into effect the next day--first
comment928,by the innkeeper of the Ship Tavern who began under Amyas's orders abustle of roasting and boiling and next by Amyas himself who invitedas many of his old schoolfellows as Frank had pointed out to him to amerry supper by which crafty scheme in came each of Rose Salteme'sgentle admirers and found himself seated at the table with six rivals.When the cloth was drawn and sack and sugar became the order of theday and the queen's health had been duly drunk with all the honoursFrank rose."And now gentlemen let me give you a health which none of you I daresay will refuse to drink with heart and soul as well as with lips--thehealth of one whom beauty and virtue have so ennobled that in theirlight the shadow of lowly birth is unseen--the health of 'The Rose ofTorridge' and a double health to that worthy gentleman whosoever hemay be whom she is fated to honour with her love."Whereupon young Will Cary of Clovelly Court calls out "Join hands allround and swear eternal friendship as brothers of the sacred order ofthe--of what Frank Leigh""The Rose" said Frank quietly.And somehow or other whether it was Frank's chivalrous speech orCary's fun or Amyas's good wine or the nobleness which lies in everyyoung lad's heart the whole party shook hands all round and vowed onthe hilt of Amyas's sword to stand by each other and by their lady-loveand neither grudge nor grumble let her dance with flirt with or marrywith whom she would and in order that the honour of their peerlessdame and the brotherhood which was named after her might be spreadthrough all lands they would go home and ask their fathers' leave togo abroad wheresoever there were "good wars."Then Amyas hearing a sneeze made a dash at the arras behind him andfinding a doorway there speedily returned dragging out Mr. JohnBrimblecombe the stout dark-skinned son of the schoolmaster.Jack Brimblecombe now one-and-twenty and a bachelor of Oxford was inperson exceedingly like a pig but he was a pig of self-helpful andserene spirit always while watching for the best contented with theworst and therefore fattening fast while other pigs' ribs stare throughtheir skins.He had lingered in the passage hovering around the fragrant smell andonce there he could not help hearing what passed inside till RoseSalterne's name fell on his ear. And now behold him brought inred-handed to judgment not without a kick or two from the wrathful footof Amyas Leigh."What business have I here" said Jack making answer fiercely amidmuch puffing and blowing. "As much as any of you. If you had asked me inI would have come. You laugh at me because I'm a poor parson's son andyou fine gentlemen. God made us both I reckon. I tell you I've lovedher these three years as well as e'er a one of you I have. Make me oneof your brotherhood and see if I do not dare to suffer as much as anyof you Let me but be your chaplain and pray for your luck when you'reat the wars. If I do stay at home in a country curacy 'tis not muchthat you need be jealous of me with her I reckon."So presently after a certain mock ceremonial of initiation JackBrimblecombe was declared on the word of Frank Leigh admitted to thebrotherhood and was sent home with a pint of good red Alicant wine inhim while the rest had a right merry evening. After which they alldeparted--Amyas and Cary to Ireland Frank to the court again. And sothe Brotherhood of the Rose was scattered and Mistress Salterne wasleft alone with her looking-glass._III.--The Good Ship Rose_When Amyas was in Ireland he made captive a certain Spanish grandee DonGuzman and sent him to Sir Richard Grenville to be held at ransom. Andthen the Irish being for the time subdued Amyas sailed with SirHumphrey Gilbert on that ill-fated voyage to Newfoundland and returnedin rags landing at Plymouth where he learnt news of Bideford.Mrs. Hawkins wife of John Hawkins the port admiral gave him supperand then told him that the Spanish prisoner had "gone off the villain.""Without paying his ransom""I can't say that but there's a poor innocent young maid gone off withhim one Salterne's daughter."
comment929,"Rose Salterne the mayor's daughter the Rose of Torridge""That's her. Bless your dear soul what ails you"Amyas had dropped back in his seat as if he had been shot but herecovered himself and next morning started for Bideford.The story was true. Don Guzman had been made governor of La Guayra inthe West Indies and his ransom had been paid. But he had fallen in lovewith the Rose and the girl driven some said by the over-harshness ofher father who loved his daughter and knew not how to manage her hadwillingly escaped with him.Amyas called on Salterne and the old burgher besought him to go inpursuit of the Spaniard and promised he would spend any money that wasneeded to fit out a ship to avenge his child. And Amyas heard thathonest John Brimblecombe now a parson mindful of his oath to thebrotherhood was longing to seek the Rose though it might be in thejaws of death. Will Cary too was for a voyage to the Indies to cut thethroat of Don Guzman.Then Mrs. Leigh and Frank her first-born getting permission to leavethe court both consented to the voyage and Frank would go too. OldSalterne grumbled at any man save himself spending a penny on thevoyage and forced on the adventurers a good ship of two hundred tonsburden and five hundred pounds towards fitting her out Mrs. Leighworked day and night at clothes and comforts of every kind Amyas gavehis time and his brains. Cary went about beating up recruits while JohnBrimblecombe preached a fierce crusade against the Spaniards and Frankgrew more and more proud of his brother.Old Salvation Yeo who was now in Bideford again brought twenty goodmen from Plymouth who had sailed with Drake.And now November 15 1583 has come and the tall ship Rose with ahundred men on board and food in abundance has dropped down fromBideford Quay to Appledore Pool. She is well-fitted with cannon andmuskets and swords and all agreed so well-appointed a ship had neversailed "out over Bar."Mrs. Leigh went to the rocky knoll outside the churchyard wall andwatched the ship glide out between the yellow dunes and lessen slowlyhour by hour into the boundless west till her hull sank below the dimhorizon and her white sails faded away into the grey Atlantic mist.And the good ship Rose went westward ho and came in due time to LaGuayra in the Indies the highest cliff on earth some seven thousandfeet of rock parted from the sea by a narrow strip of bright greenlowland. Amyas and his company are at last in full sight of the spot inquest of which they have sailed four thousand miles of sea. Beyond thetown two or three hundred feet up the steep mountain side is a large
comment930,white house with a royal flag of Spain flaunting before it. That mustbe the governor's house that must be the abode of the Rose of Torridge.There are ships of war in the landing-place.Amyas's plan was to wait till midnight attack the town on the westplunder the government storehouses and then fight their way back totheir boats. To reach the governor's house seemed impossible with thesmall force at their disposal.But Frank would not have their going away without doing the very thingfor which they came."I will go up to that house Amyas and speak with her" he said.Then Amyas Cary and Brimblecombe drew lots as to which of them shouldaccompany him and the lot fell upon Amyas Leigh.At midnight Amyas went on deck and asked for six volunteers. Whosoeverwould come should have double prize money."Why six only captain" said an old seaman. "Give the word and any andall of us will go up with you sack the house and bring off thetreasure and the lady before two hours are out""No no my brave lads As for treasure it is sure to have been put allsafe into the forts and as for the lady God forbid that we shouldforce her a step without her own will."The boat with Frank Amyas and the six seamen reached the pebble beach.There seemed no difficulty about finding the path to the house sobright was the moon. Leaving the men with the boat they started up thebeach with their swords only."She may expect us" whispered Frank. "She may have seen our ship andsome secret sympathy will draw her down towards the sea to-night."They found the path which wound in zig-zags up the steep rocky slopeeasily. It ended at a wicket-gate and they found the gate was open whenthey tried it."What is your plan" said Amyas."I have none. I go where I am called--love's willing victim."Amyas was at his wits' end. A light was burning in a window on the upperstory twenty black figures lay sleeping on the terrace.Frank saw the shadow of the Rose against the window. She came down andhe made a wild appeal to her."Your conscience Your religion--""No never I can face the chance of death but not the loss of myhusband. Go For God's sake leave me"Frank turned and Amyas dragged him down the hill. Both were too proudto run but the whole gang of negroes were in pursuit and stones wereflying.They were not twenty-five yards from the boat when the storm burst anda volley of great quartz pebbles whistled round their heads. Frank isstruck and Amyas takes him over his shoulders and plunges wildly ontowards the beach."Men to the rescue" Amyas shouts. "Fire men Give it the blackvillains"The arquebuses crackled from the boat in front but balls are answeringfrom behind. The governor's guard have turned out followed them to thebeach and are firing over the negroes' heads.Amyas is up to his knees in water battered with stones blinded withblood but Frank is still in his arms. Another heavy blow--confused massof negroes and English foam and pebbles--a confused roar of shoutsshots curses and he recollects no more.He is lying in the stern-sheets of the boat stiff and weak. Two menonly are left of the six and Frank is not in the boat. With weary workthey made the ship and as the alarm being now given it was hardlysafe to remain where they were it was agreed to weigh anchor. Amyas hadno hope that Frank might still be alive. So ended that fatal venture ofmistaken chivalry._IV.--Amyas Comes Home for the Third Time_More than three years have passed since the Rose sailed out fromBideford and never a word has reached England of what has befallen the
comment931,ship and her company.Many have been the adventures of Amyas and the men who have followedhim. Treasure they have got in South America and old Salvation Yeo hasfound a young girl whom he had lost twelve years before grown up wildamong the Indians. Ayacanora she is called and she is white for herfather was an Englishman and her mother Spanish for all her savageways and will not be separated from her discoverers but insists ongoing with them to England. And Amyas has learnt that his brother Frankwas burnt by order of the Inquisition and with him Rose and that DonGuzman had resigned the governorship of La Guayra.Amyas swore a dreadful oath before all his men when he was told of thedeath of Frank and Rose that as long as he had eyes to see a Spaniardand hands to hew him down he would give no quarter to that accursednation and that he would avenge all the innocent blood shed by them.And now it is February 1587 and Mrs. Leigh grown grey and feeble instep is pacing up and down the terrace walk at Burrough. A flash isseen in the fast darkening twilight and then comes the thunder of a gunat sea. Twenty minutes later and a ship has turned up the Bidefordriver and a cheer goes up from her crew.Yes Amyas has come and with him Will Cary and the honest parson JackBrimblecombe and the good seamen of Devon and Ayacanora who kneltdown obedient before Mrs. Leigh because she had seen Amyas kneel andwhom Mrs. Leigh took by the hand and led to Bur-rough Court.William Salterne would take none of his share of the treasure which wasbrought home and which he had a just claim to."The treasure is yours sir" he said to Amyas. "I have enough and morethan enough. And if I have a claim in law for aught which I know notneither shall ever ask--why if you are not too proud accept that claimas a plain burgher's thank-offering to you sir for a great and a noblelove which you and your brother have shown to one who though I say itto my shame was not worthy thereof."That night old Salterne was found dead kneeling by his daughter's bed.His will lay by him. Any money due to him as owner of the Rose and a
comment932,new barque of 300 tons burden he had bequeathed to Captain Amyas Leighon condition that he should re-christen that barque the Vengeance andwith her sail once more against the Spaniard.In the summer of 1588 comes the great Armada and Captain Leigh has theVengeance fitted out for war and is in the English Channel. He hasfound out that Don Guzman is on board the Santa Catherina and is set ontaking his revenge.For twelve months past this hatred of Don Guzman has been eating out hisheart and now the hour has struck. But the Armada melts away in thestorms of the North Sea and Captain Leigh has pursued the SantaCatherina round the Orkneys and down to Lundy Island. And there on therock called the Shutter the Santa Catherina strikes and then vanishesfor ever and ever."Shame" cried Amyas hurling his sword far into the sea "to lose myright when it was in my very grasp"A crack which rent the sky a bright world of flame and then a blank ofutter darkness. The great proud sea captain has been struck blind by theflash of lightning.                                   Once more Amyas Leigh has come home. His work is over his hatred dead.And Ayacanora will comfort him."Amyas my son" said Mrs. Leigh "fear not to take her to your heartfor it is your mother who has laid her there""It is true after all" said Amyas to himself. "What God has joinedtogether man cannot put asunder."                                   HENRY KINGSLEYGeoffry Hamlyn     Henry Kingsley younger brother of Charles Kingsley was born     at Barnack Northamptonshire England Jan. 2 1830. Leaving     Worcester College Oxford in 1853 he with a number of     fellow-students emigrated to the Australian goldfields. After     some five years of unremunerative toil he returned to England     poor in pocket but possessing sufficient knowledge of life to     justify his adoption of a literary career. His first attempt     and perhaps his most successful was "The Recollections of     Geoffry Hamlyn" published in 1859 which was based largely on     his own experiences in Australia. From that time until his     death on May 24 1876 some nineteen stories flowed in quick
comment933,     succession from his pen none of them however reaching the     high standard of his first two--"Geoffry Hamlyn" and     "Ravenshoe." In 1869 Kingsley became editor of the Edinburgh     "Daily Review" and on the outbreak of the Franco-German War     represented that paper at the front. He was present at the     battle of Sedan and was the first Englishman to enter the     town afterwards._I.--In a Devonshire Village_The twilight of a winter's evening was fast falling into night and oldJohn Thornton sat dozing by the fire. His face looked worn and aged andanyone might see the old man was unhappy.What could there be to vex him Not poverty at all events for not ayear ago a relation had left him 5000 and a like sum to his daughterMary. And his sister--a quiet good old maid--had come to live with himso that now he was comfortably off and had with him the only tworelations he cared about to make his old age happy. His daughter Mary--abeautiful girl merry impetuous and thoughtless--was standing at thewindow.The white gate swings on its hinges and a tall man comes with rapideager steps up the walk. The maid bringing in candles announces "Mr.George Hawker"As the light fell on him any man or woman might have exclaimedinstantly and with justice "What a handsome fellow" Handsome he waswithout doubt and yet the more you looked at him the less you likedhim. The thin lips the everlasting smile the quick suspicious glancewere fearfully repulsive. He was the only son of a small farmer in oneof the outlying hamlets of Drumston. His mother had died when he wasvery young and he had had little education and strange stories were incirculation about that lonely farmhouse not much to the credit offather or son which stories John Thornton must in his position ofclergyman have heard somewhat of so that one need hardly wonder at hisuneasiness when he saw him enter.For Mary Thornton adored him. The rest of the village disliked andmistrusted him but she with a strange perversity loved him with herwhole heart and soul. After a few words the lovers were whispering in
comment934,the window.Presently the gate goes again and another footfall is heardapproaching.That is James Stockbridge. I should know that step in a thousand. As heentered the parlour John's face grew bright and he held out his handto him but he got rather a cool reception from the pair at the window.Old John and he were as father and son and sat there before thecheerful blaze smoking their pipes."How are your Southdowns looking Jim" says the vicar. "How isScapegrace Hamlyn""He is very well sir. He and I are thinking of selling up and going toNew South Wales."The vicar was "knocked all of a heap" at Jim's announcement butrecovering a little said "You hear him He is going to sell hisestate--250 acres of the best land in Devon--and go and live among theconvicts. And who is going with him Hamlyn the wise Oh dear me Andwhat is he going for"That was a question apparently hard to answer. Yet I think the realcause was standing there with a look of unbounded astonishment upon herpretty face."Going to leave us James" she cried. "Why whatever shall I do withoutyou""Yes Miss Mary" said James huskily. "I think I may say we've settledto go. Hamlyn has got a letter from a cousin of his who is making afortune and besides I've got tired of the old place somehow lately."Time went on and May was well advanced. That had at last reached thevicar's ears which had driven him to risk a quarrel with his daughterand forbid George Hawker the house.George went home one evening and found Madge the gipsy woman who hadbrought him up sitting before the kitchen fire."Well old woman where's the old man""Away at Colyton fair" she answered."I hope he'll have the sense to stay there to-night He'll fall off hishorse coming home drunk one night and be found dead in a ditch.""Good thing for you if he was.""Maybe" said George "but I'd be sorry for him too.""He's been a good father to you George and I like you for speaking upfor him. He's an awful old rascal my boy but you'll be a worse if youlive.""Now stop that Madge I want your help old girl.""Ay and you'll get it my pretty boy. Bend over the fire and whisperin my ear lad.""Madge old girl" he whispered "I've wrote the old man's name where Ioughtn't to have done.""What again" she answered. "Three times For God's sake George mindwhat you're at Why you must be mad What's this last""Why the five hundred. I only did it twice.""You mustn't do it again George. He likes you best of anything next hismoney and sometimes I think he wouldn't spare you if he knew he'd beenrobbed. You might make yourself safe for any storm if you liked.""How""Marry that little doll Thornton and get her money.""Well" said George "I am pushing that on. The old man won't comeround and I want her to go off with me but she can't get up hercourage yet."But in a few days Mary had consented. They had left the village atmidnight and were married in London. Within a year George Hawker hadspent all his wife's money and had told her to her face he was tired ofher. He fell from bad to worse and finally becoming the ally of acoiner was arrested and transported for life.Mary Hawker with a baby tramped her way home to the village she had
comment935,left._II.--A General Exodus_The vicar had only slowly recovered from the fit in which he had fallenon the morning of Mary's departure to find himself hopelesslyparalytic. When Mary's letter written just after her marriage came itwas a great relief. They had kept from him all knowledge of GeorgeHawker's forgery which had been communicated to them by Major Buckleyold John Thornton's very good friend and near neighbour.But George' Hawker burnt the loving letters they wrote in reply andMary remained under the impression that they had cast her off. So whenone bright Sunday morning old Miss Thornton found a poor woman sittingon the doorstep Mary rose prepared to ask forgiveness. Her aunt rushedforward wildly and hugged her to her honest heart.When they were quieted Miss Thornton went up to tell the vicar. Thepoor old man was far gone beyond feeling joy or grief to any greatextent. Mary looking in saw he was so altered she hardly knew him.The good news soon got up to Major Buckley's and he was seen stridingup the path leading the pony carrying his wife and child. While theywere still busy welcoming Mary came a ring at the door. Who but hercousin Tom Troubridge Who else was there to raise her four good feetfrom the floor and call her his darling little sisterThis was her welcome home--to the home she had dreaded to come to whereshe had meant to come only as a penitent to leave her child and goforth to die.After dinner Mrs. Buckley told Mary all the news how her husband hadheard from Stockbridge how he and Hamlyn were so flourishing and hadwritten such an account of the country that Major Buckley halfpersuaded before had now made up his mind to go there himself and TomTroubridge was much inclined to go too. Mary was sad to think of losingthem all so soon but Mrs. Buckley pointed out her father's state gentlyto her and asked her to think what she would do when he was gone. MissThornton said she had made up her mind to go wherever Mary went if itwere to the other end of the earth.Scarcely more than a week had passed when another messenger came to oldJohn Thornton and one so peremptory that he rose and followed it in thedead of night.It was two months yet before the major intended to sail and long beforethey had passed Mary and Miss Thornton had determined to cast in theirlot with the others and cross the sea towards a more hopeful land._III.--The New World_A new heaven and a new earth. All creation is new and strange. Thetrees the graceful shrubs the bright-coloured flowers ay the verygrass itself are of species unknown in Europe while flaming lories andbrilliant paroquets fly whistling through the gloomy forest andoverhead countless cockatoos wheel and scream in noisy joy as we maysee the gulls do in England.We are in Australia three hundred and fifty miles south of Sydney onthe great watershed which divides the Belloury from the Maryburnong.As the sun was going down James Stockbridge and I Geoffry Hamlynreined up our horses and gazed down the long gully at our feet. For fivedays we had been passing from run to run making inquiries about somecattle we had lost and were now fifty long miles from home.At this time Stockbridge and I had been settled in our new home abouttwo years and were beginning to get comfortable and settled. We had hadbut little trouble with the blacks and having taken possession of afine piece of country were flourishing and well-to-do. I dismounted toset right some strap or other and stood looking at the prospect gladto ease my legs for a time cramped with many hours' riding.Stockbridge sat immovable and silent as a statue and I saw that hisheart travelled farther than his eye could reach."Jim" said I "I wonder what is going on at Drumston now""I wonder" he said softly."Jim" I began again "do you ever think of poor little Mary now"
comment936,"Yes old boy I do" he replied. "I was thinking of her then--I amalways thinking of her. I wonder if she married that fellow Hawker""I fear there's but little doubt of it" I said. "Try to forget herJames you'll make all your life unhappy if you don't."He laughed."That's all very well Jeff but it's easier said than done. Do you hearthat There are cattle down the gully"There was some noise in the air beside the evening rustle of the southwind among the tree-tops. Now it sounded like a far-off hubbub ofwaters now swelled up harmonious like the booming of cathedral bellsacross some rich old English valley on a still summer's afternoon."I'll tell you what I think it is old Jeff it's some new chums goingto cross the watershed and look for new country to the south. Let us godown to meet them they will come down by the river yonder."All doubt about what the newcomers were was solved before we reached theriver so we sat and watched the scene so venerable and ancient--thepatriarchs moving into the desert to find new pasture-ground.First came the cattle lowing loudly then horsemen six or seven innumber and last four drays came crawling up the pass.Suddenly James dashed forward with a shout and when I came up with himwondering I found myself shaking hands talking and laughing withMajor Buckley and Tom Troubridge.They told us all the news as we rode with them to the drays where satMrs. Buckley--a noble happy matron laughing at her son as he toddledabout busy gathering sticks for the fire. Beside her sat Mary lookingsad and worn with her child on her lap and poor old Miss Thorntonglancing uneasily round.Mary sprang up burst into hysterical weeping. I saw how his big heartyearned to comfort his old sweetheart in her distress as he took thechild of his rival to his bosom."Is nobody going to notice me or my boy I wonder" said Mrs. Buckley."Come here immediately Mr. Stockbridge before we quarrel."Soon we were all restored to our equanimity and laying plans for futuremeetings.Next morning with many hearty farewells and having promised to spendChristmastide with them I turned my horse homewards and went mysolitary way. Jim was going on with them to see them settled._IV.--Father and Son_There is a long period of dull prosperity coming to our friends. Go ontwo years. See Baroona the Buckley's place now. That hut where wespent the pleasant Christmas-day is degraded into the kitchen for a newhouse is built--a long low house with deep cool verandas all roundalready festooned with passion flowers and young grape-vines.Mary and Miss Thornton had stayed with the Buckleys till good Cousin Tomhad got a house ready for them--a charming house covered with creepersand backed by huts sheep-yards and all the usual concomitants of aflourishing Australian sheep-station. This is Toonarbin where MaryHawker is living with her son Charles as happy and uninteresting anexistence as ever fell to the lot of a handsome woman yet. The old darkdays seem like a bad dream. She had heard of her husband's re-convictionand life sentence--finally death and George Hawker is as one who hasnever lived.So sixteen years rolled peacefully away until Tom Troubridge returnedfrom a journey up country with news of a great gang of bushrangers being
comment937,"out." He had actually sat hob-nob with the captain in a public housewithout knowing it. But his servant William Lee an ex-convict knewhim and told them that the great Captain Tonan with whose crimes thewhole country was ringing was George Hawker himself. Mary's terriblefear that father and son might meet made her ill and delirious forweeks Tom and his trusty servant kept watch then heard from a passingcattle-dealer that the gang had been "utterly obliterated" by CaptainDesborough the chief of police--but the captain had escaped.Things went on quietly for two months and no one thought aboutbushrangers--but Mary at her watch up at the lonely forest station--till one morning Lee's body was found dead in his hut with a pistollying near with "G. Hawker" scratched upon it. A messenger was sent posthaste to fetch Desborough and his troopers who came declared thecountry in a state of siege and kept us all staying at Major Buckley's.We were sitting merrily over our wine one day when hasty steps camethrough the house. The bushrangers had attacked a station not far offkilled the owner and were now riding towards Captain Brentford's themajor's nearest neighbour and old friend. Captain Desborough rose withdeadly wrath in his face. The laughing Irishman was gone and a sterngloomy man stood in his place. But the villains had done their work ofdestruction before we reached Garoopm and gone off to the mountains."We shall have them in the morning" said Desborough. "More particularlyas they have in their drunken madness hampered themselves in themountains."We started before daybreak each man of us armed with swords andpistols and every man knew the use of his weapons well.As we entered the mouth of the glen to which we were bound one of themost beautiful gullies I have ever seen I turned to the man beside me.Conceive my horror at finding it was Charles Hawker I said fiercely"Get back Charles Go home You don't know what you're doing lad."He defied me. I was speaking to him again when there came a puff ofsmoke from the rocks overhead and down I went head over heels. Abullet grazed my thigh and killed my horse so that during the fightthat followed I was sitting on a rock very sick and very stupid."They've set a watch" said Captain Desborough. "They'll fight us nowthey can't help it thank God"Then under the beetling crags the bushrangers turned like huntedwolves and stood at bay. Now the fight became general and confused. Allabout among the ferns and flowers men fought and fired and cursed.
comment938,Shots were cracking on all sides and two riderless horses weregalloping about neighing.Desborough fought neither against small nor great but only against oneman--George Hawker. Him he had sworn he would bring home alive or dead.He caught sight of his quarry and instantly made towards him. As soonas Hawker saw he was recognised he made to the left trying to reachthe only practicable way back to the mountains. They fired at oneanother without effect. As the ground got more open Desborough wasaware of one who came charging recklessly up alongside of him andrecognised Charley Hawker. He had had no hint of the relationship."Good lad" he said "come on. I must have that fellow before us. He'sthe arch-devil of the lot. We must have him""We'll have him safe enough" said Charles. "Push to the left captainand we shall get him among these fallen rocks."They pushed forwards and soon succeeded in bringing him to bay. Alastoo wellHe reined up when he saw escape was impossible and awaited theircoming. Desborough's horse received a bullet in the chest and down wenthorse and man together. But Charles pushed on till within ten yards ofthe bushranger and levelled his pistol to fire.For an instant father and son glared on one another as the father madehis aim more deadly. The bullet sped and the poor boy tumbled from hissaddle clutching wildly at the grass and flowers--shot through thechest. Then ere Desborough had disentangled himself from his fallenhorse George Hawker rode off laughing--out through the upper rock wallsinto the presence of the broad snow-line that rolled above his head inendless lofty tiers and made for the broader valley which stretchedbeyond.There was no pursuit he thought. How could there be Who knew of thisroute but he and his mates No creature was stirring but he mustonwards--onwards across the snow. Twilight and then night and stillthe snow but half passed. Strange ghosts and fancies crowd in upon himthick and fast.Morning and the pale ghosts have departed. He reached the gully wherehis refuge lay utterly dispirited just as the sun was setting. Heturned a sharp angle round an abrupt cliff. He saw a horseman within tenyards of him--Captain Desborough holding a pistol to his head Hungrycold desperate unarmed--his pistols had gone with his horse over aprecipice--he threw up his arms and was instantly chained fast toDesborough's saddle only to be loosed he knew by the gallows.Without a word on either side they began their terrible journey. Theyhad gone two or three miles before Hawker said "That young fellow I
comment939,shot when you were after me is he dead""By this time" said Desborough. "He was dying as I came away.""Would you mind stopping for a moment captain Now tell me who was he""Mr. Charles Hawker son of Mrs. Hawker of Toonarbin."Desborough told me his wild despairing cry rang in his ears for yearsafterwards.                                   One wild dreary day in spring Major Buckley and I were admitted to thecondemned cell in the gaol in Sydney. Before us was a kind of bed place.On it lay a man with his face buried in the pillow. I advanced towardshim but the governor held me back."My God sir" he said "take care Don't as you value your life gowithin length of his chain."The handsome head was raised and my eyes met George Hawker's. I couldnot see the fierce desperate villain who had kept our country-side interror so long I could only see the handsome curly-headed boy who usedto play with James Stockbridge and myself in Drumston churchyard Andseeing him and him only I sat down beside him and put my arm roundhis neck.I don't want to be instructed in my duty. My duty as a magistrate was tostand at the farther end of the cell and give this hardened criminal amoral lecture. But I only hung there with my arm round his neck andsaid "Oh George George" like a fool.He put his hands on my shoulders and looked me in the face and saidafter a time "What Hamlyn Old Jeff Hamlyn Jeff old boy I'm to behung to-morrow.""I know it" I said. "And I came to ask if I could do anything for you.""Anything you like old Jeff" he said with a laugh "so long as youdon't get me reprieved. I've murdered my own son Jeff. Do you knowthat"I answered "Yes I know that George but you did not know who he was.""He came at me to take my life" said Hawker. "And I tell you if I hadguessed who he was I'd have blown my brains out to save him from thecrime of killing me."The major came forward and held out his hand to George Hawker andasked him to forgive him he had been his enemy since they first met."Let me tell you major I feel more kind and hearty towards you andHamlyn for coming to me like this than I've felt towards any man thistwenty years. Time's up I see. I ain't so much of a coward am I JeffGood-bye old lad good-bye"That was the last we saw of him the next morning he was executed withfour of his comrades.                                   After all this we old folks taking up our residence at Baroona hadagreed to make common house of it. We were very dull at first but I
comment940,remember many pleasant evenings when we played whist and Mary Hawkerin her widow's weeds sat sewing by the fireside contentedly enough.But one evening next spring in stalked Tom Troubridge and in short hetook her off with him and they were married. And I think I never saw acouple more sincerely attached than she and her husband.                                   Ravenshoe     "Ravenshoe" was Henry Kingsley's second novel and it was     published in 1862 when its author was thirty-two years old.     It will always rank with "Geoffry Hamlyn" as Henry Kingsley's     best work. These two books were their author's favourites     among his own novels and Charles Ravenshoe was one of his two     favourite characters. It has been said that "Ravenshoe" is     "alive--the expression of a man who worked both with heart and     brain" and few would care to dispute that opinion. For study     of character wide charity of outlook brilliant descriptive     writing--as for instance in the charge at Balaclava and     real not mawkish pathos--as in the hopeless misery of     Charles invalided with only eighteen shillings out of the     army--"Ravenshoe" will always deserve to be read. It is the     work of a writer who was not ashamed to avow himself an     "optimist."_I.--Charles Loses His Brother and His Home_In 1820 Densil lost both his father and mother and found himself atthe age of thirty-seven master of Ravenshoe--an estate worth 10000 ayear--and master of himself.Densil was an only son. His father Peter Ravenshoe had married Aliciadaughter of Charles Earl of Ascot.The Ravenshoes an old West of England family were Catholics butDensil's second wife his first wife died childless in 1816 was aProtestant and made her husband promise that all her children afterher first born should be brought up Protestant.Mrs. Ravenshoe bore Densil two sons Cuthbert born 1826 Charles born1831.On the night Charles was born his mother lay dying and Densil swore toher he would keep the promise he had made. And to this vow he wasfaithful in spite of the indignation of Father Mackworth the residentCatholic priest at Ravenshoe.The doctor insisted that a nurse was an immediate necessity and JamesHorton Densil's devoted servant and head keeper suggested his wifeNorah a proposal that had the doctor's immediate approval.In due time Charles went to Eton and to Oxford where he was rusticatedfor a term with his friend Lord Welter Lord Ascot's eldest son andfell in love with Adelaide a penniless young lady who acted ascompanion to old Lady Ascot.At Ravenshoe Charles and Mackworth seldom met without a "sparringmatch" for to the priest it was intolerable that this house should inthe event of Cuthbert dying childless pass into Protestant hands.On the other hand it was natural that a considerable amount offamiliarity and a most sincere and hearty affection should existbetween Charles and his servant and foster-brother William Horton. TillCharles went to Shrewsbury he had never had another playfellow for hisbrother Cuthbert was reserved and bookish and the friendship between thetwo had grown with age.One other inmate of Ravenshoe must be mentioned--this was little MaryCorby who was saved miraculously from the wreck of the Warren Hastings
comment941,when Charles was about ten. She was the daughter of Captain Corby andwhen the ship went down in fifteen fathoms of water the mate assistedby fishermen and encouraged by Densil managed to get the little girlto shore and to Ravenshoe--for the house was not far from the cliffs.In spite of Densil's letters and inquiries no friends came forward toclaim little Mary then a child of nine and in three months she wasconsidered as a permanent member of the household. And the night beforeCharles went to school he told her of his grand passion for Adelaide.On the day of the Oxford and Cambridge boat-race when Charles rowedthree in the winning boat Densil Ravenshoe died after two days'illness. Old James Horton's death occurred at the same time. Charleshurried home in time for the funeral and when all was over a servantcame up to him and asked him would he see Mr. Ravenshoe in the libraryCharles entered the library with William who had also been sent for.Charles went up silently and kissed his brother on the forehead. For afew minutes Cuthbert neither moved nor spoke while Charles greetedMackworth civilly. William stood at a little distance looking uneasilyfrom one to another.Cuthbert broke the silence and as he spoke Charles by some instinctlaid his hand on William's shoulder."I sent for you" he said "on business which must be gone through withthough I expect it will kill me. I should like to prepare you for whatis to come but the blow would be equally severe whether you expect itor not. You two who stand there were nursed at the same breast. Thatgroom on whose shoulder you have your hand now is my real brother youare no relation to me--you are the son of the faithful old servant whomwe buried to-day with my father"Charles at once asked for proofs and witnesses and Mackworth took upthe tale."Your mother was Norah James Horton's wife. James Horton was DensilRavenshoe's half-brother and the illegitimate son of Peter. Sheconfessed to me the wicked fraud she practised and has committed thatconfession to paper. I hold it. You have not a point of ground to standon. You have been living in luxury and receiving an expensive educationwhen you should have been cleaning out the stable."Charles's heart died away within him."Cuthbert" he said "you are a gentleman. Is this true""God knows how terribly true it is" said Cuthbert quietly.Father Mackworth handed the paper signed by his mother to him andCharles read it. It was completely conclusive. William also read it andturned pale.Cuthbert spoke again in his quiet passionless voice."My intention" he said "is to make a provision of 300 a year for thisgentleman whom till the last few days I believed to be my brother. Lessthan twenty-four hours ago Charles I offered Father Mackworth 10000for this paper with a view to destroying it. You see what a poor weakrogue I am and what a criminal I might become with a little temptation.Father Mackworth did his duty and refused me""You acted like yourself Cuthbert. Like one who would risk body andsoul for one you loved. But it is time that this scene should end. Iutterly refuse the assistance so nobly offered. I go forth alone intothe world to make my own way or to be forgotten. It only remains to saygood-bye. I leave this house without a hard thought towards any one init. I am at peace with all the world. Father Mackworth I beg yourforgiveness. I have often been rude and brutal to you. Good-bye"He shook hands with Mackworth then with William and lastly he went upto Cuthbert and kissed him on the cheek and then walked out of the doorinto the hall."I am going to follow him wherever he goes" said William. "If he goesto the world's end I will be with him"_II.--Charles Loses Himself_Charles fled from Ravenshoe for London in the middle of the nightdetermined that William should not follow him. But he could not bear togo out and seek fortune without seeing Adelaide. So he called atRanford Lord Ascot's seat only to learn that Adelaide had eloped withLord Welter. The two were married when he afterwards saw them in London.
comment942,Charles had to tell his story to old Lady Ascot and when he had goneshe said to herself "I will never keep another secret after this. Itwas for Alicia's sake and for Peter's that I did it and now see whathas become of me"In London Charles Ravenshoe committed suicide deliberately. He did nothang himself or drown himself he hired himself out as groom--beingperfectly accomplished in everything relating to horses--to LieutenantHornby of the 140th Hussars and when the Crimean War broke outenlisted under the name of Simpson as a trooper in Hornby's regiment.On October 25 Charles was at Balaclava. They went down hill straighttowards the guns and almost at once the shot from them began to tell.Charles was in the second line and the men in the front line began tofall terribly fast as they rode into the narrowing valley. It wasimpossible to keep line. Presently the batteries right and left openedon them and those who were there engaged can give us very little ideaof what followed in the next quarter of an hour. They were soon amongthe guns--the very guns that had annoyed them from the first--andCharles and two or three others known to him were hunting some Russianartillerymen round these guns for a minute or so.He saw also at this time a friend of his--a cornet--on foot and rode tohis assistance. He caught a riderless horse and the cornet mounted.Then the word was given to get back again and as they turned theirfaces to get out of this terrible hell poor Charles gave a short sharpscream and bent down in his saddle over his horse's neck.It was nothing. It was only as if one were to have twenty teeth pulledout at once. The pain was over in an instant. His left arm seemed nearlydead but he could hold his reins in a way. He saw Hornby before himand his own friends were beside him again and there was a rally and acharge. At guns No. At men this time--Russian hussars--right valiantfellows too. He could do but little himself. He rode at a Russian andunhorsed him he remembers seeing the man go down. They beat them backand then turned and rode--for it was time.As the noise of the battle grew fainter behind them he looked around tosee who was riding beside him and holding him by the right arm. It wasthe little cornet. Charles wondered why he did so."You're hard hit Simpson" said the cornet. "Never mind. Keep yoursaddle a little longer. We shall be all right directly."Charles looked down and noticed that his left arm was hanging numbed byhis side and that a trooper was guiding his horse.Soon they were among English faces and English cheers rang out inwelcome to their return but it was nothing to him he kept his eye
comment943,which was growing dim on Hornby and when he saw him fall off hissaddle into the arms of a trooper he dismounted too and staggeredtowards him.The world seemed to go round and round and he felt about him like ablind man. But he found Hornby somehow. Presently a doctor was bendingover him.Later they found Hornby dead and cold with his head on Charles's lap.Charles had been struck by a ball in the bone of his arm and thesplinters were driven into the flesh though the arm was not broken. Itwas a nasty business said the doctors. All sorts of things might happento him. Only one thing was certain and that was that CharlesRavenshoe's career in the army was over for ever.At home they all believed him dead for William had traced him to Varnaand there had been informed that his foster-brother had died of cholera.The change of name was partly responsible for this for among the deador living there was no signs of Charles Ravenshoe.But he recovered after a long spell in the hospital at Scutari andafter a time was sent home to Fort Pitt. But that mighty left arm whichhad done such noble work when it belonged to No. 3 in the OxfordUniversity Eight was useless and Charles Simpson trooper of the140th was discharged from the army and found himself on Christmas Evein the street with eighteen shillings and ninepence in his pocketwondering blindly what the end would be but no more dreaming of beggingfrom those who had known him formerly than of leaping off WaterlooBridge._III.--The Last Eighteen Shillings_Charles's luck seemed certainly to have deserted him at last. He had gotto spend his Christmas with eighteen shillings and a crippled left armand had nothing left to trust to but his little friend the cornet whohad come home invalided and was living with his mother in Hyde ParkGardens.The cornet welcomed him with both hands and hearing from Charles ofhis plight said "Now I know you are a gentleman and I may offendyou but if you are utterly hard up take service with me. There""I will do so with the deepest gratitude" said Charles. "But I cannotride I fear. My left arm is gone.""Pish Ride with your right. It's a bargain."Then Charles went upstairs and was introduced to the cornet's mother.
comment944,He accepted his new position with dull carelessness. Life was gettingvery worthless. And all this time had he but known it money and ahome and sweet little Mary Corby who had loved him ever since he was aboy were waiting for him.There was also a remarkable advertisement which appeared in the "Times"for a considerable period and was never seen by Charles. Theadvertisement was inserted by old Lady Ascot and offered one hundredguineas to any person who could discover the register of marriagebetween Peter Ravenshoe Esq. of Ravenshoe in the county of Devon andMaria Dawson supposed to have been solemnised about 1778.How was Charles to know that Cuthbert Ravenshoe was dead that Williamnow master of Ravenshoe still hoped for his foster-brother's life andthat old Lady Ascot was doing all she could to atone for a mistakeCharles in fact was still very weak and ill and served his friend thecornet in a poor way. He had not recovered the shock of his fever anddelirium in the Crimea and both nerve and health were gone.Nobody could be more kind and affectionate than the cornet and his deafmother. They guessed that he was "somebody" and that things were wrongwith him and the cornet once or twice invited his confidence but hewas too young and Charles had not the energy to tell him anything.And life was getting very very weary business for Charles. By dayriding had become a terror and at night he got no rest. And his mindbegan to dwell too much on the bridges over the Thames and on the waterlapping and swirling about the piers.Then as it happened a little shoeblack with whom Charles had struck upa friendship falling sick in a foul court in South London Charles mustneeds go and sit with him. The child died in his arms and a dull terrorcame on Charles when he thought of his homeward journey. A scripturereader who had been in the room came towards him and laid his hand uponhis shoulder. Charles turned from the dead child and looked up into theface of John Marston the best of his old Oxford friends.They passed out of the house together Charles clinging tight to JohnMarston's arms. When they got to Marston's lodgings Charles sat down bythe fire and said quietly "John you have saved me I should neverhave got home this night."But John Marston by finding Charles had dashed his dearest hopes tothe ground. He had always loved Mary Corby from his first visit toRavenshoe and Mary loved Charles who had loved Adelaide who hadmarried Lord Welter. Marston thought there was just a chance for himand now that chance was gone. How did he behave knowing thatHe put his hand on Charles's shoulder and said "Charles--Charles mydear old boy look up Think of Mary. She has been wooed by more thanone but I think her heart is yours yet.""John" said Charles "that is what has made me hide from you all likethis. I know that she loved me above all men and partly that she shouldforget a penniless and disgraced man like myself and partly from asilly pride I have spent all my cunning on losing myself hoping thatyou would believe me dead.""We have hunted you hard Charles. You do not know I suppose that youare a rich man and undoubtedly heir of Ravenshoe though one link isstill wanting.""What do you mean""There is no reasonable doubt although we cannot prove it that yourgrandfather Peter was married previously to his marriage with Lady
comment945,Alicia Staunton that your father James was the real Ravenshoe whilepoor Cuthbert and William--""Cuthbert I will hide again. I will never displace Cuthbert mind you.""Cuthbert is dead. He was drowned bathing last August."Charles broke down and cried like a child. When he was quiet he askedafter William."He is very well as he deserves to be. He gave up everything to huntyou through the world and bring you back. Now my dear old boy dosatisfy my curiosity. What regiment did you enlist in""In the 140th."He paused hid his face in his hands and then his speech became rapidand incoherent."At Devna we got wood-pigeons and I rode the Roucan-nosed bay and hecarried me through it capitally. I ask your pardon sir but I am only apoor discharged trooper. I would not beg sir if I could help it butpain and hunger are hard things to bear sir""Charles--Charles Don't you know me""That is my name sir. That is what they used to call me. I am no commonbeggar sir. I was a gentleman once sir and rode a-horseback. I was inthe light cavalry charge at Balaclava. An angry business. They shouldn'tget good fellows to fight together like that--"The next morning old Lady Ascot William Mary and John Marston wereround his bed listening to his half-uttered delirious babble. Theanxious question was put to the greatest of the doctors present. "Mydear Dr. B---- will he die""Well yes" said the doctor. "I would sooner say 'Yes' than 'No'--thechances are so heavy against him. You must really prepare for theworst."_IV.--A Life-Long Shadow_Of course he did not die--I need not tell you that. The doctors pulledhim through. And when he was better the doctors removed the splinters ofbone from his arm. He did not talk much in this happy quiet time.William and Lady Ascot were with him all day. William dear fellow usedto sit on a footstool and read the "Times" to him.Lord Welter now Lord Ascot on the death of his father came to seeCharles one day and something he said made Charles ask if Adelaide wasdead."Tell me something" said Lord Ascot. "Have you any love left for heryet""Not one spark" said Charles. "If I ever am a man again I shall askMary Corby to marry me. I ought to have done so sooner perhaps. But Ilove your wife Welter in a way and I should grieve at her death forI loved her once.""The truth is very horrible. We went out hunting together and I wasgetting the gate open for her when her devil of a horse rushed it anddown they came on it together. And she broke her back and the doctorsays she may live till seventy but that she will never move from whereshe lies--and just as I was getting to love her so dearly--"
comment946,That same afternoon Charles asked William to get Mary to come and seehim and William straightway departed and found Mary. And later in theday Miss Mary Corby announced that she and Charles were engaged to bemarried.William was still master of Ravenshoe but he was convinced that thefirst marriage of his grandfather would be proved and Charlesreinstated."Remember Charles I am not spending the revenues of Ravenshoe" hesaid. "They are yours. I know it. I am spending about 400 a year. Whenour grandfather's marriage is proved you will provide for me and mywife I know that. Be quiet."William had long been engaged from the time he had been Charles'sservant to a fisherman's daughter Jane Evans and the change in hisfortunes made no difference in the matter. She was only a fisherman'sdaughter but she was wonderfully beautiful and gentle and good.The weddings took place at St. Peter's Eaton Square. Mary and Charleswere not a handsome couple. The enthusiasm of the population wasreserved for William and Jane Evans who certainly were.Father Mackworth dying after a stroke of paralysis told us the dateand place of Peter Ravenshoe's first marriage--Finchampstead Berks1778. He had known the truth but had been anxious to keep Ravenshoe inCatholic hands."You used to irritate and insult me sir" he said turning to Charles"and I was not so near death then as now. If you can forgive me inGod's name say so"Charles went over to him and put his arm round him."Forgive you" he said. "Dear Mackworth can you forgive me"The register was found and the lawyers were soon busy. One document maybe noted a rent charge on Ravenshoe of two thousand a year in favour ofWilliam Ravenshoe.                                   Well Charles and William are both happily married now and I sawCharles last summer playing with his eldest boy. But there was a cloudon his face for the memory of those few terrible months has cast itsshadow upon him and the shadow will lie I fancy upon that foreheaduntil the forehead is smoothed in the sleep of death.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The World's Greatest Books Volume V.by Arthur Mee and J.A.

SHERIDAN LE FANUUncle Silas     Joseph Sheridan le Fanu Irish novelist poet and journalist     was born at Dublin on August 28 1814. His grandmother was a     sister of Richard Brinsley Sheridan his father a dean.     Educated at Trinity College Dublin Le Fanu became a     contributor to the "Dublin University Magazine" afterwards     its editor and finally its proprietor. He also owned and     edited a Dublin evening paper. Le Fanu first came into     prominence in 1837 as the author of the two brilliant Irish     ballads "Phaudhrig Croohore" and "Shamus O'Brien." His     novels which number more than a dozen were first published     in most cases in his magazine. His power of producing a     feeling of weird mystery ranks him with Edgar Allan Poe. It     may be questioned whether any Irish novelist has written with     more power. The most representative of his stories is "Uncle     Silas a Tale of Bartram-Haugh" which appeared in 1864. Le     Fanu died on February 7 1873._I.--Death the Intruder_It was winter and great gusts were rattling at the windows a very darknight and a very cheerful fire blazing in a genuine old fire-place ina sombre old room. A girl of a little more than seventeen slight andrather tall with a countenance rather sensitive and melancholy wassitting at the tea-table in a reverie. I was that girl.The only other person in the room was my father Mr. Ruthyn of Knowl.Rather late in life he had married and his beautiful young wife had
comment953,died leaving me to his care. This bereavement changed him--made himmore odd and taciturn than ever. There was also some disgrace about hisyounger brother my Uncle Silas which he felt bitterly and he hadgiven himself up to the secluded life of a student.He was pacing the floor. I remember the start with which not suspectinghe was close by me I lifted my eyes and saw him stand looking fixedlyon me from less than a yard away."She won't understand" he whispered "no she won't. _Will_ she Theyare easily frightened--ay they are. I'd better do it another way andshe'll not suspect--she'll not suppose. See child" he said after asecond or two. "_Remember_ this key."It was oddly shaped and unlike others."It opens that." And he tapped sharply on the door of a cabinet. "Youwill tell nobody what I have said under pain of my displeasure.""Oh no sir""Good child _Except_ under one contingency. That is in case I shouldbe absent and Dr. Bryerly--you recollect the thin gentleman inspectacles and a black wig who spent three days here lastmonth--should come and enquire for the key you understand in myabsence.""But you will then be absent sir" I said. "How am I to find the key""True child. I am glad you are so wise. _That_ you will find I haveprovided for. I have a very sure friend--a friend whom I oncemisunderstood but now appreciate."I wondered silently whether it would be Uncle Silas."He'll make me a call some day soon and I must make a little journeywith him. He's not to be denied I have no choice. But on the whole Irather like it. Remember I say I rather like it."I think it was about a fortnight after this conversation that I was onenight sitting in the great drawing-room window when on a sudden on thegrass before me stood an odd figure--a very tall woman in greydraperies courtesying rather fantastically smiling very unpleasantlyon me and gabbling and cackling shrilly--I could not distinctly hear_what_--and gesticulating oddly with her long arms and hands. This wasMadame de la Rougierre my new governess.I think all the servants hated her. She was by no means a pleasant_gouvernante_ for a nervous girl of my years. She was always making
comment954,excuses to consult my father about my contumacy and temper. Shetormented me by ghost stories to cover her nocturnal ramblings and shebetrayed a terrifying curiosity about his health and his will. My cousinMonica Lady Knollys who visited us about this time was shocked at herpresence in the house it was the cause of a rupture between my fatherand her. But not even a frustrated attempt to abduct me during one ofour walks--which I am sure madame connived at--could shake my father'sconfidence in her though he was perfectly transported with fury onhearing what had happened. It was not until I found her examining hiscabinet by means of a false key that he dismissed her but madame hadcontrived to leave her glamour over me and now and then the memory ofher parting menaces would return with an unexpected pang of fear.My father never alluded again to Madame de la Rougierre but whetherconnected with her exposure and dismissal or not there appeared to besome new trouble at work in his mind."I am anxious about you Maud" he said. "_You_ are more interested than_I_ can be in vindicating his character.""Whose character sir" I ventured to inquire during the pause thatfollowed."Whose Your Uncle Silas's. In course of nature he must survive me. Hewill then represent the family name. Would you make some sacrifice toclear that name Maud"I answered briefly but my face I believe showed my enthusiasm."I can tell you Maud if my life could have done it it should not havebeen undone. But I had almost made up my mind to leave all to time toilluminate or _consume_. But I think little Maud would like tocontribute to the restitution of her family name. It may cost yousomething. Are you willing to buy it at a sacrifice Your Uncle Silas"he said speaking suddenly in loud and fierce tones that sounded almostterrible "lies under an intolerable slander. He troubles himself littleabout it he is selfishly sunk in futurity--a feeble visionary. I am notso. The character and influence of an ancient family are a peculiarheritage--sacred but destructible. You and I we'll leave one proof onrecord which fairly read will go far to convince the world."That night my father bade me good-night early. I had fallen into a dozewhen I was roused by a dreadful crash and a piercing scream from Mrs.Rusk. Scream followed scream pealing one after the other unabated
comment955,wilder and more terror-stricken. Then came a strange lull and the dullsounds of some heavy body being moved.What was that dreadful sound Who had entered my father's chamber Itwas the visitor whom he had so long expected with whom he was to makethe unknown journey leaving me alone. The intruder was Death_II.--The Sorceries of Bartram-Haugh_One of those fearful aneurisms that lie close to the heart had given wayin a moment. He had fallen with the dreadful crash I had heard deadupon the floor. He fell across the door which caused a difficulty inopening it. Mrs. Rusk could not force it open. No wonder she had givenway to terror. I think I should have lost my reason.I do not know how those awful days and still more awful nights passedover. Lady Knollys came and was very kind. She was odd but hereccentricity was leavened with strong commonsense and I have oftenthought since with gratitude of the tact with which she managed mygrief.I did not know where to write to Dr. Bryerly to whom I had promised thekey but in accordance with my father's written directions his deathwas forthwith published in the principal London papers. He came atmidnight accordingly and on the morrow the will was read. Except for alegacy of 10000 to his only brother Silas Ruthyn and a few minorlegacies to relations and servants my father had left his whole estateto me appointing my Uncle Silas my sole guardian with full parentalauthority over me until I should have reached the age of twenty-one upto which time I was to reside under his care at Bartram-Haugh with thesum of 2000 paid yearly to him for my suitable maintenance andeducation.I was startled by the expression of cousin Monica's face. She lookedghastly and angry."To whom" she asked with an effort "will the property belong incase--in case my cousin should die before she comes of age""To the next heir her uncle Mr. Silas Ruthyn. He's both heir-at-lawand next-of-kin" replied the attorney.She was anxious to persuade my uncle to relinquish his guardianship toher but the evening of the funeral a black-bordered letter came fromhim bidding me remain at Knowl until he could arrange for my journey tohim. There was a postscript which made my cheek tingle."Pray present my respects to Lady Knollys who I understand issojourning at Knowl. I would observe that a lady who cherishes I havereason to fear unfriendly feelings against your uncle is not the mostdesirable companion for his ward. But upon the express condition that Iam not made the subject of your discussions I do not interpose to bringyour intercourse to an immediate close.""Did I ever hear Well if this isn't impertinent" exclaimed LadyKnollys. "I did not intend to talk about him but now I _will_." And soit was that I heard the story of that enigmatical person--martyr angeldemon--Uncle Silas with whom my fate was now so strangely linked.It was twenty years ago. He was not a reformed rake but a ruined onethen. My father had helped him again and again until his marriage witha barmaid. After that he allowed him five hundred a year and the use ofhis estate of Bartram-Haugh. Then Mr. Charke a gentleman of the turfwho was staying with my uncle for Doncaster Races was found dead in hisroom--he had committed suicide by cutting his throat. And Uncle Silaswas suspected of having killed him.This wretched Mr. Charke had won heavy wagers at the races from Uncle
comment956,Silas and at night they had played very deep at cards. Next morning hisservant could not enter his room it was locked on the inside thewindow was fastened by a screw and the chimney was barred with iron. Itseemed that he had hermetically sealed himself in and then killedhimself. But he had been in boisterous spirits. Also though his ownrazor was found near his right hand the fingers of his left hand werecut to the bone. Then the memorandum-book in which his bets were notedwas nowhere to be found. Besides he had written two letters to afriend saying how profitable he had found his visit to Bartram-Haughand that he held Uncle Silas's I O U's for a frightful sum and althoughmy uncle stoutly alleged he did not owe him a guinea there had scarcelybeen time in one evening for him to win back so much money. In a momentthe storm was up and although my uncle met it bravely he failed toovercome it and became a social outcast in spite of all my father'sefforts.And now I was to rehabilitate him before the world and accordingly allpreparations were made for my departure from Knowl and at last themorning came--a day of partings a day of novelty and regrets.I remember we passed a gypsy bivouac on our journey with fires alighton the edge of a great heathy moor. I had my fortune told and I amashamed to confess I paid the gypsy a pound for a brass pin with a roundbead for a head--a charmed pin which would keep away rat and cat andsnake a malevolent spirit or "a cove to cut my throat" from hurtingme. The purchase was partly an indication of the trepidations of thatperiod Of my life. At all events I had her pin and she my pound and Iventure to say I was the gladder of the two.It was moonlight when we reached Bartram-Haugh. It had a forlorncharacter of desertion and decay contrasting almost awfully with thegrandeur of its proportions and richness of its architecture. A shabbylittle old man a young plump but very pretty female figure inunusually short petticoats and a dowdy old charwoman all stood in thedoor among a riot of dogs. I sat shyly back peeping at the picturebefore me."Will you tell me--yes or no--is my cousin in the coach" screamed the
comment957,young lady. She received me with a hug and a hearty "buss" as shecalled that salutation and was evidently glad to see me. Then afterleading me to my bed-room to make a hurried toilet she conducted me toa handsome wainscotted room where my Uncle Silas awaited me.A singular looking old man--a face like marble with a fearfulmonumental look--an apparition drawn as it seemed in black and whitevenerable bloodless fiery-eyed with its strange look of power and anexpression so bewildering. Was it derision or anguish or cruelty orpatienceHe said something in his clear gentle but cold voice and taking bothmy hands led me affectionately to a chair near his own. He was amiserable invalid he told me after speaking a little eulogy of hisbrother and examining me closely respecting his illness and itssymptoms. At last remarking that I must be fatigued he rose and kissedme with a solemn tenderness and placing his hand on a large Biblebade me "Remember that book in it lives my only hope. Consult it mybeloved niece day and night as the only oracle.""I'm awful afraid of the governor I am" said Cousin Milly when we hadleft him. "I was in a qualm. When he spies me a-napping maybe he don'tfetch me a prod with his pencil-case over the head."But Milly was a pretty and a clever creature in spite of her uncouthdialect and I liked her very much. We spent much time taking longcountry rambles and exploring the old house many of whose rooms wereclosed and shuttered. Of my uncle we saw little. He was "queerish"Milly said and I learnt afterwards he took much laudanum.My other cousin Dudley I did not meet till later. To my horror Ibeheld in him one of the party of ruffians who had terrified me so muchthe day of the attempted abduction at Knowl but he stoutly denied everhaving been there with an air so confident that I began to think I mustbe the dupe of a chance resemblance. My uncle viewed him with a strangepaternal affection. But dear Cousin Monica had written asking Milly andme to go to her and we had some of the pleasantest and happiest days ofour lives at her house of Elverston for there Milly met her good littlecurate the Rev. Sprigge Biddlepen and Lord Ilbury.
comment958,Uncle Silas was terribly ill when we returned to Bartram-Haugh theresult of an overdose of opium but for the doctor's aid he would havedied. Remembering how desperate Lady Knollys had told me his monetaryposition was a new and dreadful suspicion began to haunt me."Had he attempted to poison himself"I remember I was left alone with him while his attendant fetched a freshcandle. A small thick Bible lay on the mantle-shelf. I turned over itsleaves and lighted on two or three odd-looking papers--promissorynotes I believe--when Uncle Silas dressed in a long whitemorning-gown slid over the end of the bed and stood behind me with adeathlike scowl and simper. Diving over my shoulder with his long thinhand he snatched the Bible from me and whispered over my head "Theserpent beguiled her and she did eat."It seemed an hour before Wyat came back. You may be sure I did notprolong my watch. I had a long hysterical fit of weeping when I got tomy room the sorceries of Bartram-Haugh were enveloping.About this time Dudley began to persecute me with his odious attentions.I was obliged to complain of him to my uncle. He was disposed to thinkwell of the match but I could not consent and it was arranged that mycousin should go abroad. And then that night I had the key to some ofthe mysterious doings at Bartram-Haugh--the comings and goings in thedarkness which had so often startled me--the face of Madame de laRougierre peeped into the room._III.--A Night of Terror_Shortly afterwards I lost Milly who was sent to a French school whereI was to follow her in three months. I bade her farewell at the end ofWindmill Wood and was sitting on the trunk of a tree when Meg Hawkes agirl to whom I had once been kind passed by."Don't ye speak nor look fayther spies us" she said quickly. "Don'tye be alone wi' Master Dudley nowhere for the world's sake"The injunction was so startling that I had many an hour of anxiousconjecture and many a horrible vigil by night. But ten days later I wassummoned to my uncle's room. He implored me once more to wed Dudley--to
comment959,listen to the appeal of an old and broken-hearted man."You see my suspense--my miserable and frightful suspense" he said."I'm very miserable nearly desperate. I stand before you in theattitude of a suppliant.""Oh I must--I must--I _must_ say no" I cried. "Don't question medon't press me. I could not--I _could_ not do what you ask""I yield Maud--I yield my dear. I will _not_ press you. I have spokento you frankly perhaps too frankly but agony and despair will speakout and plead even with the most obdurate and cruel"He shut the door not violently but with a resolute hand and I thoughtI heard a cry.The discovery that Dudley was already married spared me furtherimportunity. I was anxious to relieve my uncle's necessities which Iknew were pressing and the attorney from Feltram was up with him allnight trying in vain to devise some means by which I might do so. Themorning after I was told I must write to Lady Knollys to ask if I mightgo to her as there was shortly to be an execution in the house.I met Dudley on my way through the hall. He spoke oddly about hisfather and made a very strange proposal to me--that I should give himmy written promise for twenty thousand pounds and he would "take mecleverly out o' Bartram-Haugh and put me wi' my cousin Knollys"I refused indignantly but he caught me by the wrist."Don't ye be a-flyin' out" he said peremptorily. "Take it or leaveit--on or off Can't ye speak wi' common sense for once I'll take yeout o' all this if you'll gi'e me what I say."He looked black when I refused again. I judged it best to tell my uncleof his offer. He was startled but made what excuse he could smilingaskance a pale peaked smile that haunted me. And then once moreentering an unfrequented room I came upon the great bony figure ofMadame de la Rougierre. She was to be my companion for a week or two Iwas told and shortly after her coming I found my walks curtailed. Iwrote again to my Cousin Knollys imploring her to take me away. Thisletter my uncle intercepted and when she came in reply to my formerletter I had but the sight of her carriage driving swiftly away.The morning after I was informed madame was to take me to join Milly inFrance. As Uncle Silas had directed I wrote to Cousin Monica fromLondon. I know madame asked me what I would do for her if she took me toLady Knollys. I was inwardly startled but refused seeing before meonly a tempter and betrayer and together we ended our journey drivingfrom the station through the dark and starless night to find ourselvesat last in Mr. Charke's room at Bartram-Haugh.There were bailiffs in the house I was told. I was locked in. Ientreated madame wildly piteously to save me but she mocked me in myagony. I escaped for a brief moment and sought my uncle. I can never
comment960,forget the look he fixed on me."What is the meaning of this Why is she here" he asked in a sternicy tone. "You were always odd niece. I begin to believe you areinsane. There's no evil intended you by-- there is none Go to yourroom and don't vex me there's a good girl"I went upstairs with madame like a somnambulist. She was to leave me tosleep alone that night. I had lost the talismanic pin I always stuck inthe bolster of my bed. Uncle Silas sent up spiced claret in a littlesilver flagon. Madame abstractedly drank it off and threw herself on mybed. I believed she was feigning sleep only and really watching me butnow I think the claret was drugged.About an hour afterwards I heard them digging in the courtyard. Like athunder-bolt it smote my brain. "They are making my grave"After the first dreadful stun I grew wild running up and down wringingmy hands and gasping prayers to heaven. Then a dreadful calm stole overme._IV.--The Open Door_It was a very still night. A peculiar sound startled me and I saw a mandescend by a rope and take his stand on the windowsill. In a momentmore window bars and all swung noiselessly open and Dudley Ruthynstepped into the room.He stole in a groping way to the bed and stooped over it. Nearly atthe same moment there came a scrunching blow an unnatural shriekaccompanied by a convulsive sound as of the motion of running and thearms drumming on the bed and then another blow--and silence. Thediabolical surgery was over. There came a little tapping at the door."Who's that" whispered Dudley hoarsely."A friend" answered a sweet voice and Uncle Silas entered.Coolness was given me in that dreadful moment. I knew that all dependedon my being prompt and resolute. With a mental prayer for help I glidedfrom the room and descended the stairs. I tried the outer door. To mywild surprise it was open. In a moment I was in the free air--and asinstantaneously was seized by Tom Brice Meg's sweetheart who waswaiting to drive the guilty father and son away."They shan't hurt ye miss. Get ye in I don't care a d----" he said ina wild fierce whisper. To me it was the voice of an angel. He droveover the grass so that our passage was noiseless then on reaching thehighway at a gallop. At length we entered Elverston. I think I was halfwild. I could not speak but ran with a loud long scream into CousinMonica's arms. I forget a great deal after that.                                   It was not till two years afterwards that I learnt that Uncle Silas wasfound next morning dead of an overdose of laudanum and that Dudley haddisappeared.Milly married her good little clergyman. I am Lady Ilbury now happy inthe affection of a beloved and noble-hearted husband. A tiny voice iscalling "Mamma" the shy useless girl you have known is now a motherthinking and trembling while she smiles how strong is love how frailis life.                                   REN LE SAGEGil Blas     Except that he was born at Sarzeau in Brittany on May 8     1668 and that he was the son of the novelist Claude le Sage     little is known of the youth of Alain Ren le Sage. Until he     was eighteen he was educated with the Jesuits at Vannes when     it is conjectured he went to Paris to continue his studies for     the Bar. An early marriage drove him to seek a livelihood by     means of literature and shortly afterwards he found a     valuable and sympathetic friend and patron in the Abb de     Lyonne who not only bestowed upon him a pension of about     125 but also gave him the use of his library. The first     results of this favour were adaptations of two plays from     Rojas and Lope de Vega which appeared some time during the     first two or three years of the eighteenth century. Le Sage's     reputation as a playwright and as a novelist rests oddly     enough in each case on one work. As the author of "Tuscaret"     produced in 1709 he contributed to the stage one of the best     comedies in the French language as author of "The Adventures     of Gil Blas of Santillana" he stands for all time in the front
comment961,     rank of the world's novelists. Here he brought the art of     story-writing to the highest level of artistic truth. The     first and second parts of the work appeared in 1715 the third     in 1724 and the fourth in 1735. Le Sage died at Boulogne on     November 17 1747._I.--I Start on my Travels_My uncle Canon Perez was a worthy priest. To live well was in hisopinion the chief duty of man. He lived very well. He kept the besttable in the town of Oviedo. I was very glad of this as I lived withhim my parents being too poor to keep me.My uncle gave me an excellent education. He even learned to read so asto be able to teach me himself. There were few ecclesiastics of his rankin Spain in the early part of the seventeenth century who could read abreviary as well as he could when I left him at the age of seventeento continue my duties at the University of Salamanca."Here are forty ducats Gil Blas" he said to me when we parted. "Andyou can take my old mule and sell it when you reach Salamanca. Then youwill be able to live comfortable until you obtain a good position."It is I suppose about two hundred miles from Oviedo to Salamanca. Notvery far you will say but it took me two years to cover the distance.When one travels along a high road at the age of seventeen master ofone's actions of an old mule and forty ducats one is bound to meetwith adventures on the way. I was out to see the world and I meant tosee it my self-confidence was equalled only by my utter inexperience.Out of my first misadventure came an extraordinary piece of good luck. Ifell into the hands of some brigands and lost my mule and my money.Among my fellow prisoners was a wealthy lady Doa Mencia of Burgos. Ihelped her to escape and got away myself and when I came to Zurgos sherewarded me very handsomely with a diamond ring and a thousand ducats.This changed my plan of life completely. Why should I go and study atSalamanca Did I want to become a priest or a pedant I was now surethat I didn't."Gil Blas" I said "you are a good-looking lad clever well-educatedand ambitious. Why not go to Madrid and try to get some place at thecourt of King Philip the Third"I spent sixty ducats in dressing myself out gaily in the manner of arich cavalier and I engaged a man of about thirty years of age to comewith me as my servant.Lamela as he was called was quite different from the other valets whoapplied for the position. He did not demand any sum as wages."Only let me come with you sir" he said. "I shall be content withwhatever you give me."It seemed to me that I had got a very good servant We slept at Duengasthe first night and on the second day we arrived at Valladolid. As Iwas sitting in my inn a charming lady entered and asked to see me."My dear Gil Blas" she exclaimed "Lamela has just told me of yourarrival. I am a cousin of Doa Mencia and I received a letter from herthis morning. How brave it was of you to rescue her from those wickedbrigands I can't leave you in this inn. You must come at once to myhouse. My brother Don Raphael will be delighted to see you when hereturns in an hour or two from our country castle."Doa Camilla as the lady was called led me to a great house in thebest part of the town and at the door we met Don Raphael. "What ahandsome young cavalier you are my dear Gil Blas" he said. "You mustmake up your mind to stay with us for some weeks."The supper was a pleasant affair. Doa Camilla and her brother foundsomething to admire in everything I said and I began to fancy myself asa wit. It was very late when Lamela led me to my bed-room and helped meto undress. And it was very late when I awoke next day. I called toLamela but he did not come so I arose and dressed myself and wentdownstairs. To my surprise there was nobody in the house and all mybaggage had disappeared. I looked at my hand--the diamond ring had gone.Then I understood why Lamela had been willing to come with me withouttroubling about wages. I had fallen for a second time into the hands ofthieves. They had hired the furnished house for a week and had trapped
comment962,me in it. It was clear that I had boasted too much at Burgos about thethousand ducats which Doa Mencia gave me. Now I found myself atValladolid quite penniless.As I walked along the street in a very despondent mood not knowing howto get a meal someone tapped me on the shoulder and said "Goodgracious Gil Blas I hardly knew you What a princely dress you've goton. A fine sword silk stockings a velvet mantle and doublet withsilver lacings Have you come into a fortune"I turned around and found it was Fabrice an old schoolfellow the sonof a barber at Oviedo. I told him of my adventure."Pride comes before a fall you see" he said with a laugh. "But I canget you a place if you care to take it. One of the principal physiciansof the town Dr. Sang-Tado is looking for a secretary. I know you writea very good hand. Sell your fine raiment and buy some plain clothes andI will take you to the doctor."I am glad to say that I obtained the post but I wasn't altogethersatisfied with it. Dr. Sangrado believed in vegetarianism and he gaveme only peas and beans and baked apples to eat and not much of those.At the end of a fortnight I resolved to go as a servant in some housewhere meat and wine were to be had."Don't be foolish" said Sangrado. "Your fortune is made if you onlystay with me. I am getting old and I require someone to help me in mypractice. You can do it. You need not waste your time in studying allthe nonsense written by other doctors. You have only to follow mymethod. Never give a patient medicine. Bleed him well and tell him todrink a pint of hot water every half hour. If that doesn't curehim--well it's time he died."So I donned one of Sangrado's gowns which gave me a very originalappearance as it was much too long and ample for me and then I beganto attend his patients. A few of them I believe managed to recover.One day a woman stopped me and took me into her house to look at herniece. I recognised the girl as soon as I saw her. It was the prettyadventuress Camilla who had decoyed me and helped to rob me of mythousand ducats. When I took her hand to feel her pulse I perceived thatshe was wearing my diamond ring. Happily she was too ill to know me.After ordering her to be bled and given a pint of warm water every halfhour I went out and talked the matter over with Fabrice. We resolvednot to call in the police as they would certainly keep whatever moneyof mine they recovered. The ways of the law in Spain in the seventeenthcentury are very strange and intricate.Nevertheless I returned late at night to the house accompanied by asergeant of the police and five of his men all well armed. I then awokeCamilla and told her to dress herself and attend before the magistrate."Oh Gil Blas" she cried "have pity on me. Lamela and Raphael have runoff with the money and left me alone here on a bed of sickness."I knew this was true as I had made inquiries but I also knew thatCamilla had had a share of the spoil and had bought some valuablejewelry with it. So I said "Very well I won't be hard on you. But youmust give me back the diamond ring which you are wearing and you mustsatisfy these officers of the police."Poor Camilla understood what I meant. It is a costly matter to satisfythe Spanish police. She gave me the ring and then with a sigh sheopened a casket and handed the sergeant everything it contained--anecklace of beautiful pearls a pair of fine earrings and some otherjewels."Isn't this better than calling in the police" said the sergeant whenwe had left the house. "There are the jewels. Two hundred ducats' worth
comment963,I'll be bound"No doubt dear reader you have seen through this little plot. Thesupposed sergeant was my old friend Fabrice and his five men were fiveyoung barbers of his acquaintance. They quickly changed their clothesand we all went to an inn and spent a merry evening together._II.--In Male Attire_A few days afterwards I took up the plan which I had formed at Burgosand bravely set out for Madrid in the hope of making my fortune there.But my money did not last long for on reaching the capital I fell inwith a wild company of fashionable actors and actresses.As my purse grew lighter my conscience became tenderer and at length Ihumbly accepted the position of lackey in the house of a rich oldnobleman Don Vincent de Guzman. He was a widower with an only childAurora--a lovely gay and accomplished girl of twenty-six years of age.I had hardly been with him a month when he died leaving his daughtermistress of all his wealth and free to do what she liked with it. To mysurprise Aurora then began to distinguish me from all the otherservants. I could see by the way she looked at me that there wassomething about me that attracted her. Great ladies I knew sometimesfall in love with their lackeys and one evening my hopes were raised tothe highest pitch for Aurora's maid then whispered to me that somebodywould like to talk to me alone at midnight in the garden. Full of wildimpatience I arrived at the spot two hours before the time. Oh thosetwo hours They seemed two eternities.At midnight Aurora appeared and I threw myself at her feet exclaiming"Oh my dear lady Even in my wildest dreams of love I never thought ofsuch happiness as this""Don't talk so loud" said Aurora stepping back and laughing. "You willrouse all the household. So you thought I was in love with you My dearboy I am in love with somebody else. Knowing how clever and ingeniousyou are I want you to come at once with me to Salamanca and help me towin my love."Naturally I was much disconcerted by this strange turn of affairs.However I managed to recover myself and listen to my mistress. She hadfallen in love with a gallant young nobleman Don Luis Pacheco who was
comment964,unaware of the passion he inspired. He was going the next day toSalamanca to study at the university and Aurora had resolved to gothere also dressed as a young nobleman and make his acquaintance. Shehad fallen in love with him at sight and had never found an opportunityto speak to him."I shall get two sets of rooms in different parts of the town" she saidto me. "In one I shall live as Aurora de Guzman with my maid who mustplay the part of an aunt. In the other I shall be Don Felix de Mendoca gallant cavalier and you must be my valet."We set off for Salamanca at daybreak and arrived before Don Luis.Aurora took a furnished mansion in the fashionable quarter and I calledat the principal inns and found the one where Don Luis had arranged tostay Aurora then hid her pretty brown tresses under a wig and put on adashing cavalier's costume and came and engaged a room at the placewhere her lover was."So you have come to study at the university sir" said the innkeeper."How lucky Another gallant young nobleman has just taken a room herefor the same purpose. You will be able to dine together and entertainone another."He introduced his two guests and they quickly became fast friends."Do you know Don Felix you're uncommonly good-looking" said Don Luisas they sat talking over the wine. "Between us we shall set on fire thehearts of the pretty girls of Salamanca.""There's really a lovely girl staying in the town" said my mistress."She's a cousin of mine Aurora de Guzman. We are said to resemble eachother in a remarkable way.""Then she must be a beautiful creature" said Don Luis "for you havefine regular features and an admirable colour. When can I see thisparagon""This afternoon if you like" said my mistress.They went together to the mansion where the maid received them dressedas an elderly noblewoman."I'm very sorry Don Felix" said the maid "but my niece has a badheadache and she has gone to lie down.""Very well" said the pretended cousin. "I will just introduce myfriend Don Luis to you. Tell Aurora we will call to-morrow morning."Don Luis was much interested in the lovely girl whom he had not beenable to see. He talked about her to his companion late into the night.The next day as they were about to set out to visit her I rushed inas arranged with a note for my mistress.
comment965,"What a nuisance" she said. "Here is some urgent business I must atonce attend to. Don Luis just run round and tell my cousin that Icannot come until this afternoon"Don Luis retired to put some final touches to his dress and my mistresshurried off with me to her mansion and there with the help of hermaid she quickly got into her proper clothes. She received Don Luisvery kindly and they talked together for quite two hours. Don Luis thenwent away and Aurora slipped into her cavalier's costume and met him atthe inn."My dear Felix" said Don Luis "your cousin is an adorable lady. I'mmadly in love with her. If I can only win her I'll marry and settledown on my estates."Aurora gazed at him very tenderly and then with a gay laugh she shookoff her wig and let her curls fall about her shoulders.Don Felix knelt at her feet and kissed her hands crying "Oh mybeautiful Aurora Do you really care for me How happy we shall betogether"The two lovers resolved to return at once to Madrid and makepreparations for the wedding. At the end of a fortnight my mistress wasmarried and I again set out on my travels with a well-lined purse._III.--Old Acquaintances_I had always had a particular desire to see the famous town of Toledo. Iarrived there in three days and lodged at a good inn where by reasonof my fine dress I passed for a gentleman of importance. But I soondiscovered that Toledo was one of those places in which it is easier tospend money than to gain it.So I set out for Aragon. On the road I fell in with a young cavaliergoing in the same direction. He was a man of a frank and pleasantdisposition and we soon got on a friendly footing. His name I learnedwas Don Alfonso he was like me seeking for means of livelihood.It came on to rain very heavily as we were skirting the base of amountain and in looking about for some place of shelter we found acave in which an aged white-haired hermit was living. At first he wasnot pleased to see us but something about me seemed to strike himfavourably and he then gave us a kind welcome. We tied our horses to atree and prepared to stay the night. The hermit began to talk to us ina very pious and edifying way when another aged anchorite ran into thecave and said "It is all over we're discovered. The police are afterus"The first hermit tore off his white beard and his hair and took off hislong robe showing a doublet beneath and his companion followed hisexample. In a few moments they were changed into a couple of young menwhose faces I recognised."Raphael Lamela What mischief are you working now And where are mythousand ducats you rascals""Ah Gil Blas I knew you at once" said Raphael blandly. "One comes on
comment966,old acquaintances when one least expects them. I know we treated youbadly. But the money's gone and can't be recovered. Come with us andwe will soon make up to you all that you have lost."It was certainly unwise to remain in a cave which the police were aboutto visit and as the rain had ceased and the night had fallen we allset out in the darkness to find some better shelter. We took the road toRequena and came to a forest where we saw a light shining in thedistance. Don Alfonso crept up to the spot and saw four men sittinground a fire eating and quarrelling. It was easy to see what they werequarrelling about. An old gentleman and a lovely young girl were boundto a tree close by and by the tree stood a fine carriage."They are brigands" said Alfonso when he returned "who have captureda nobleman and his daughter I think. Let us attack them. In order nodoubt to prevent their quarrelling turning into a deadly affray theyhave piled all their arms in a heap some yards away from the fire. Sothey cannot make much of a fight."And they did not. We quietly surrounded them and shot them down beforethey were able to move. Don Alfonso and I then set free the captiveswhile Raphael and Lamela rifled the pockets of the dead robbers."I am the Count of Polan and this is my daughter Seraphina" said theold gentleman. "If you will help me to get my carriage ready I willdrive back to an inn which we passed before entering the forest."When we came to the inn the count begged us all to stay with him.Raphael and Lamela however were afraid that the police would trackthem out Don Alfonso who had been talking very earnestly to Seraphinawas for some strange reason also unwilling to remain so I fell inwith their views."Why didn't you stay" I said to Don Alfonso."I was afraid the count would recognise me as Seraphina has done" hesaid. "I killed his son in a duel just when I was trying to winSeraphina's love. Heaven grant that the service I have now rendered willmake him inclined to forgive me."The day was breaking when we reached the mountains around Requena. Therewe hid till nightfall and then we made our way in the darkness to thetown of Xeloa. We found a quiet shady retreat beside a woodland streamand there we stayed while Lamela went into the town to buy provisions.He did not return until evening. He brought back some extraordinarythings.He opened a great bundle containing a long black mantle and robeanother costume a roll of parchment a quill and a great seal in greenwax."Do you remember the trick you played on Camilla" he said to me. "Ihave a better scheme than that. Listen. As I was buying some provisionsat a cook-shop a man entered in a great rage and began abusing acertain Samuel Simon a converted Jew and a cruel usurer. He had ruinedmany merchants at Xeloa and all the towns-people would like to see himruined in turn. Then my dear Gil Blas I remembered your clever trickand brought these clothes so that we might visit this Jew dressed up asthe officers of the Inquisition."After we had made a good meal Lamela put on the robe and mantle of theInquisitor Raphael the costume of the registrar and I took the part ofa sergeant of the police. We walked very solemnly to the house of theusurer Simon opened the door himself and started back in affright."Master Simon" said Lamela in a grave imperative tone of voice "Icommand you on behalf of the Holy Inquisition to deliver to theseofficers the key of your cabinet. I must have your private papersclosely examined. Serious charges of heresy have been brought againstyou."The usurer grew pale with fear. Far from doubting any deceit on ourpart he imagined that some of his enemies had informed the Holy Officeagainst him. He obeyed without the least resistance and opened hiscabinet."I am glad to see" said Lamela "that you do not rebel against theorders of the Holy Inquisition. Retire now to another room and let me
comment967,carry out the examination without interference."Simon withdrew into a farther room and Lamela and Raphael quicklysearched in the cabinet for the strongbox. It was unlocked being sofull of money that it could not be closed. We filled all our pocketsthen our hose and then stuffed the coins in any place in our clothesthat would hold them. After this we closed the cabinet and ourpretended Inquisitor sealed it down with a great seal of green wax andsaid very solemnly to the usurer "Master Simon I have sealed yourcabinet with the seal of the Holy Office. Let me find it untouched whenI return to-morrow morning to inform you of the decision arrived at inyour case."The next morning we were a good many leagues from Xeloa. At breakfastwe counted over the money which we had taken from Simon. It came tothree thousand ducats of which we each took a fourth part. Raphael andLamela then desired to carry out a similar plot against someone in thenext town but Don Alfonso and I would not agree to take any part in theaffair and set out for Toledo. There Don Alfonso was reconciled to theCount of Polan and soon afterwards he and Seraphina were happilymarried.I retired to Lirias a pleasant estate that Don Alfonso gave me andthere I married happily and grew old among my children. In the reign ofPhilip IV. I went to the court and served under the great ministerOlivarez. But I have now returned to Lirias and I do not intend to goto Madrid again.                                   CHARLES LEVERCharles O'Malley     The author of "Charles O'Malley" perhaps the most typical of     Irish novelists was of English descent on his father's side.     But Charles James Lever himself was Irish by birth being born     at Dublin on August 31 1806--Irish in sentiment and     distinctly Irish in temperament. In geniality and extravagance     he bore much resemblance to the gay riotous spirits he has     immortalised in his books. "Of all the men I have ever     encountered" says Trollope "he was the surest fund of     drollery." Lever was intended for medicine but financial     difficulties forced him to return to literature. His first     story was "Harry Lorrequer" published in 1837. It was     followed in 1840 by "Charles O'Malley the Irish Dragoon"     which established his reputation as one of the first humorists     of his day. The story is the most popular of all Lever's     works and in many respects the most characteristic. The     narrative is told with great vigour and the delineation of     character is at once subtle and life-like. Lever died on June     1 1872._I.--O'Malley of O'Malley Castle_It was in O'Malley Castle a very ruinous pile of incongruous masonrythat stood in a wild and dreary part of Galway that I passed my infancyand youth. When a mere child I was left an orphan to the care of myworthy uncle. My father whose extravagance had well sustained thefamily reputation had squandered a large and handsome property incontesting elections for his native county and in keeping up thatsystem of unlimited hospitality for which Ireland in general and Galwaymore especially was renowned. The result was as might be expectedruin and beggary. When he died the only legacy he left to his brotherwas a boy of four years of age entreating him with his last breath"Be anything you like to him Godfrey but a father--or at least sucha one as I have proved."Godfrey O'Malley sometime previous had lost his wife and when this new
comment968,trust was committed to him he resolved never to re-marry but to rear meas his own child.From my earliest years his whole anxiety was to fit me for the part of acountry gentleman as he regarded that character--_viz._ I rode boldlywith the fox-hounds I was about the best shot within twenty miles Icould swim the Shannon at Holy Island I drove four-in-hand better thanthe coachman himself and from finding a hare to hooking a salmon myequal could not be found from Killaloe to Banagher. These were thestaple of my endowments besides which the parish priest had taught mea little Latin a little French and a little geometry.When I add to this portraiture of my accomplishments that I was nearlysix feet high with more than a common share of activity and strengthfor my years and no inconsiderable portion of good looks I havefinished my sketch and stand before my reader.We were in the thick of canvassing the county for the parliamentary seatin my uncle's interest. O'Malley Castle was the centre of operationswhile I a mere stripling and usually treated as a boy was entrustedwith an important mission and sent off to canvass a distant relationMr. Matthew Blake who might possibly be approachable by a youngerbranch of the family with whom he had never any collision.I arrived at his house while the company were breakfasting. After theusual shaking of hands and hearty greetings were over I was introducedto Sir George Dashwood a tall and singularly handsome man of aboutfifty and his daughter Lucy Dashwood.If the sweetest blue eyes that ever beamed beneath a forehead of snowywhiteness over which dark brown and waving hair fell less in curlsthan masses of locky richness could only have known what wild work theywere making of my poor heart Miss Dashwood I trust would have lookedat her teacup or her muffin rather than at me as she actually did onthat fatal morning.Beside her sat a tall handsome man of about five-and-thirty or perhapsforty years of age with a most soldierly air who as I was presentedto him scarcely turned his head and gave me a half-nod of unequivocalcoldness. As I turned from the lovely girl who had received me withmarked courtesy to the cold air and repelling hauteur of thedark-browed captain the blood rushed throbbing to my forehead and as Iwalked to my place at the table I eagerly sought his eye to return hima look of defiance and disdain proud and contemptuous as his own.Captain Hammersly however never took further notice of me and Iformed a bitter resolution which I endeavoured to carry into effectduring the next day's hunt. Mounted on my best horse I deliberately ledhim across the worst and roughest country river and hills and wallsand ditches till I finished up with a broken head and he with a brokenarm and a horse that had to be slaughtered.On the fourth day after this adventure I was able to enter thedrawing-room again. Sir George Dashwood made the kindest inquiries about
comment969,my health."They tell me you are to be a lawyer Mr. O'Malley" said he "and ifso I must advise you to take better care of your headpiece.""A lawyer papa Oh dear me" said his daughter. "I should never havethought of his being anything so stupid.""Why silly girl what would you have a man to be""A dragoon to be sure papa" said the fond girl as she pressed herarm around him and looked up in his face with an expression of mingledpride and affection.That word sealed my destiny._II.--I Join the Dragoons_I had been at Mr. Blake's house five days before I recollected myuncle's interests but with one hole in my head and some half-dozen inmy heart my memory was none of the best. But that night at dinner Idiscovered to my savage amazement that Mr. Blake and all the companywere there in the interest of the opposition candidate and that SirGeorge Dashwood was their candidate. In my excitement I hurled mywineglass at the head of one of the company who expressed himself inregard to my uncle in a manner insulting to a degree. In the duel whichfollowed I shot my opponent.I had sprung into man's estate. In three short days I had fallen deeplydesperately in love and had wounded if not killed an antagonist in aduel. As I meditated on these things I was aroused by the noise ofhorses' feet. I opened the window and beheld no less a person thanCaptain Hammersly. I begged of him to alight and come in."I thank you very much" he said "but in fact my hours are nownumbered here. I have just received an order to join my regiment. Icould not however leave the country without shaking hands with you. Iowe you a lesson in horsemanship and I'm only sorry that we are not tohave another day together. I'm sorry you are not coming with us.""Would to heaven I were" said I with an earnestness that almost mademy brain start."Then why not""Unfortunately my worthy uncle who is all to me in this world wouldbe quite alone if I were to leave him and although he has never saidso I know he dreads the possibility of my suggesting such a thing.""Devilish hard but I believe you are right. Something however mayturn up yet to alter his mind. And so good-bye O'Malley good-bye."During the contest for the seat--which was frankly fought in pitchedbattles and scrimmages and by corruption and perjury--I managed to saveMiss Dashwood's life. When polling-time came Sir George found thefeeling against him was so strong and we were so successful in beatinghis voters out of the town in spite of police and soldiers that heresigned his candidature.Afterwards I spent some time in Dublin nominally in preparation for thelaw at Trinity College. But my college career convinced my uncle thatmy forte did not lie in the classics and Sir George succeeded ininducing him to yield to my wishes and interested himself so stronglyfor me that I obtained a cornetcy in the 14th Light Dragoons a weekbefore the regiment sailed for Portugal. On the morning of my last day
comment970,in Dublin I met Miss Dashwood riding in the park. For some minutes Icould scarcely speak. At last I plucked up courage a little and said"Miss Dashwood I have wished most anxiously before I parted for everwith those to whom I owe already so much that I should at least speakmy gratitude.""But when do you think of going""To-morrow. Captain Power under whose command I am has received ordersto embark immediately for Portugal."I thought--perhaps it was but a thought--that her cheek grew somewhatpaler as I spoke but she remained silent.Fixing my eyes full upon her I spoke."Lucy I feel I must confess it cost what it may--I love you. I knowthe fruitlessness the utter despair that awaits such a sentiment. Myown heart tells me that I am not cannot be loved in return. I ask fornothing I hope for nothing. I see that you at least pity me. Nay oneword more. Do not when time and distance have separated us think thatthe expressions I now use are prompted by a mere sudden ebullition ofboyish feeling for I swear to you that my love to you is the source andspring of every action in my life and when I cease to love you Ishall cease to feel. And now farewell farewell for ever."I pressed her hand to my lips gave one long last look turned my horserapidly away and ere a minute was out of sight._III.--I Smell Gunpowder_What a contrast to the dull monotony of our life at sea did the scenepresent which awaited us on landing at Lisbon The whole quay wascrowded with hundreds of people eagerly watching the vessel which borefrom her mast the broad ensign of Britain.The din and clamour of a mighty city mingled with the far-off sounds ofmilitary music and in the vistas of the opening streets masses oftroops might be seen in marching order. All betokened the near approachof war.On the morning after we landed Power rode off with dispatches toheadquarters leaving me to execute two commissions with which he hadbeen entrusted--a packet for Hammersly from Miss Dashwood and an epistlefrom a love-sick midshipman who could not get on shore to the SenhoraInez da Silviero. I took up the packet for Hammersly with a heavy heart.Alas thought I how fatally may my life be influenced by itThe loud call of a cavalry trumpet roused me and I passed out into thestreet for the morning's inspection. The next day I delivered the packetto the Senhora Inez by whom I was warmly received--rather more on myown account than on that of the little midshipman I fancied. CertainlyI never beheld a being more lovely and I found myself paying her someattentions. Yet she was nothing to me. It is true she had as she mostcandidly informed me a score of admirers among whom I was not evenreckoned she was evidently a coquette. On May 7 1809 we set off forOporto. The 14th were detailed to guard the pass to the Douro until thereinforcements were up and then I saw my first engagement. Never tillnow as we rode to the charge did I know how far the excitement reacheswhen man to man sabre to sabre we ride forward to the battlefield. Onwe went the loud shout of "Forward" still ringing in our ears. Onebroken irregular discharge from the French guns shook the head of ouradvancing column but stayed us not as we galloped madly on.I remember no more. The din the smoke the crash--the cry for quartermingled with the shout of victory the flying enemy--are all commingledin my mind but leave no trace of clearness or connection between themand it was only when the column wheeled to re-form that I awoke from mytrance of maddening excitement and perceived that we had carried theposition and cut off the guns of the enemy.The scene was now beyond anything maddening in its interest. From thewalls of Oporto the English infantry poured forth in pursuit while thewhole river was covered with boats as they still continued to crossover. The artillery thundered from the Sierra to protect the landingfor it was even still contested in places and the cavalry charging in
comment971,flank swept the broken ranks and bore down their squares. Then a finalimpetuous charge carried the day.From that fight I got my lieutenancy and then was sent off by SirArthur Wellesley on special duty to the Lusitanian Legion inAlcantara--a flattering position opened to my enterprise. Before I setout I was able to deliver Miss Dashwood's packet to Captain Hammerslybarely recovered from a sabre wound. His agitation and his manner inreceiving it puzzled me greatly though my own agitation was scarcelyless.When I returned after a month with the Legion during which my serviceswere of no very distinguished character I found a letter from Galwaywhich saddened my thoughts greatly. A lawsuit had gone against my uncleand what I had long foreseen was gradually accomplishing--the wreck ofan old and honoured house. And I could only look on and watch theprogress of our downfall without power to arrest it._IV.--Shipwrecked Hopes_Having been sent to the rear with dispatches I did not reach Talaveratill two days' hard fighting had left the contending armies withoutdecided advantage on either side.I had scarcely joined my regiment before the 14th were ordered tocharge.We came on at a trot. The smoke of the cannonade obscured everythinguntil we had advanced some distance but suddenly the splendid panoramaof the battlefield broke upon us."Charge Forward" cried the hoarse voice of our colonel and we wereupon them. The French infantry already broken by the withering musketryof our people gave way before us and unable to form a square retiredfighting but in confusion and with tremendous loss to their position.One glorious cheer from left to right of our line proclaimed thevictory while a deafening discharge of artillery from the Frenchreplied to this defiance and the battle was over.For several months after the battle of Talavera my life presentednothing which I feel worth recording. Our good fortune seemed to havedeserted us when our hopes were highest for from the day of thatsplendid victory we began our retrograde movement upon Portugal. Pressedhard by overwhelming masses of the enemy we saw the fortresses ofCiudad Rodrigo and Almeida fall successively into their hands andretired mystified and disappointed to Torres Vedras.Wounded in a somewhat scatter-brain night expedition to the lines ofCiudad Rodrigo my campaigning--for some time at least--was concludedfor my wound began to menace the loss of my arm and I was ordered backto Lisbon. Fred Power was the first man I saw and almost the firstthing he told me was that Sir George Dashwood was in Lisbon and thathis daughter was with him. And then with conflicting feelings I foundthat all Lisbon mentioned my name in connection with the senhora andSir George himself in appointing me an aide-de-camp threw increasedgloom over my thoughts by referring to the report Power had spoken of.My torment was completed by meeting Miss Dashwood in the Senhora Inez'shouse under circumstances which led to treat me with stiff formal
comment972,courtesy.The next night a letter from a Dublin friend reached me which told methat "Hammersly had got his _cong_."Here then was the solution of the whole chaos of mystery here thefull explanation of what had puzzled my aching brain for many a nightlong. His own were the letters I had delivered into Hammersly's hands. Aflood of light poured at once across all the dark passages of myhistory and Lucy too--dare I think of her What if she had reallycared for me Oh the bitter agony of that thought To think that all myhopes were shipwrecked with the very land in sight.I sprang to my feet with some sudden impulse but as I did so theblood rushed madly to my head and I fell. My arm was again broken andere day I was delirious.Hours days weeks rolled over and when I returned to consciousness andconvalescence I found I had been removed to the senhora's villa and toher I owed in a large part my recovery. I was deeper in my dilemmathan ever. Nevertheless before I returned to the front I found anopportunity to vindicate to Lucy my unshaken faith reconciling theconflicting evidences with the proofs I proffered of my attachment. Wewere interrupted before I could learn how my protestations werereceived. Power I found soon after was the one favoured by the fairInez's affections._V.--A Desolate Hearth_It is not my intention were I even adequate to the task to trace withanything like accuracy the events of the war at this period. In fact tothose who like myself were performing duties of a mere subalterncharacter the daily movements of our own troops not to speak of thecontinual changes of the enemy were perfectly unknown and an Englishnewspaper was more ardently longed for in the Peninsula than by the mosteager crowd of a London coffee-room.So I pass over the details of the retreat of the French and the greatbattle of Fuentes D'Ooro. In the storming of Ciudad Rodrigo that deathstruggle of vengeance and despair I gained some notoriety in leading aparty of stormers through a broken embrasure and found myself underLord Wellington's displeasure for having left my duties as aide-de-camp.However the exploit gained me leave to return to England and theadditional honour of carrying dispatches to the Prince Regent.When I arrived in London with the glorious news of the capture of CiudadRodrigo the kind and gracious notice of the prince obtained meattentions on all sides. Indeed so flattering was the reception I metwith and so overwhelming the civility showered on me that it requiredno small effort on my part not to believe myself as much a hero as they
comment973,would make me. An eternal round of dinners balls and entertainmentsfilled up an entire week.At last I obtained the Prince Regent's permission to leave London and afew mornings after landed in Cork. Hastening my journey I was walkingthe last eight miles--my chaise having broken down--when suddenly myattention was caught by a sound which faint from the distance scarcestruck upon my ear. Thinking it probably some delusion of my heatedimagination I rose to push forward but at the moment a slight breezestirred and a low moaning sound swelled upward increasing eachinstant as it came. It grew louder as the wind bore it towards me andnow falling now swelling it burst forth into one loud prolonged cryof agony and grief. O God it was the death-wailMy suspense became too great to bear I dashed madly forward. As Ineared the house the whole approach was crowded with carriages andhorsemen. At the foot of the large flight of steps stood the black andmournful hearse its plumes nodding in the breeze and as the soundswithout sank into sobs of bitterness and woe the black pall of acoffin borne on men's shoulders appeared at the door and an old mana life-long friend of my uncle across whose features a struggle forself-mastery was playing held out his hand to enforce silence. I sprangtoward him choked by agony. He threw his arms around me and mutteringthe words "Poor Godfrey" pointed to the coffin.Mine was a desolate hearth. In respect to my uncle's last wishes I soldout of the army and settled down to a quieter life than the clang ofbattle the ardour of the march. Gradually new impressions and newduties succeeded and ere four months elapsed the quiet monotony of mydaily life healed up the wounds of my suffering and a sense of contentif not of happiness crept gently over me and I ceased to long for theclash of arms and the loud blast of the trumpet.But three years later a regiment of infantry marching to Cork forembarkation for the Continent after Bonaparte's return from Elba rousedall the eagerness of my old desires and I volunteered for serviceagain.A few days after I was in Brussels and attending that most memorableand most exciting entertainment the Duchess of Richmond's ball on thenight of June 15 1815. Lucy Dashwood was there beautiful beyondanything I had ever seen her. When the word came of the advance ofNapoleon I was sent off with the major-general's orders and then joinedthe night march to Quatre Bras. There I fell into the hands of a Frenchtroop and missed the fighting though I saw Napoleon himself and hadthe good fortune to effect the escape of Sir George Dashwood who lay aprisoner under sentence of death in the same place as myself. Early inthe day of Waterloo I contrived my own escape and was able to give LordWellington much information as to the French movements.After the battle I wandered back into Brussels and learned that we hadgained the day. As I came into the city Sir George met me and took meinto his hotel where were Power and the senhora about to be married.Wounded by the innocent raillery of my friends I escaped into an emptyroom and buried my head in my hands. Oh how often had the phantom ofhappiness passed within my reach but glided from my grasp"Oh Lucy Lucy" I exclaimed aloud. "But for you and a few wordscarelessly spoken I had never trod the path of ambition whose end hasbeen the wreck of all my happiness But for you I had never loved sofondly But for you and I had never been--""A soldier you would say" whispered a soft voice as a light handgently touched my shoulder. "No Mr. O'Malley deeply grateful as I amto you for the service you once rendered myself bound as I am by everytie of thankfulness by the greater one to my father yet do I feel thatin the impulse I have given to your life I have done more to repay mydebt to you than by all the friendship all the esteem I owe you. Ifindeed by any means you became a soldier then I am indeed proud.""Alas Lucy--Miss Dashwood I would say--how has my career fulfilled thepromise that gave it birth For you and you only to gain youraffection I became a soldier. And now and now----"
comment974,"And now" said she while her eyes beamed upon me with a very flood oftenderness "is it nothing that I have glowed with pride at triumphs Icould read of but dared not share in I have thought of you. I havedreamed I have prayed for you.""Alas Lucy but not loved me."Her hand which had fallen upon mine trembled violently. I pressed mylips upon it but she moved it not. I dared to look up her head wasturned away but her heaving bosom betrayed emotion.Our eyes met--I cannot say what it was--but in a moment the wholecurrent of my thoughts was changed. Her look was bent upon me beamingwith softness and affection her hand gently pressed my own and herlips murmured my name.The door burst open at this moment and Sir George Dashwood appeared.Lucy turned one fleeting look upon her father and fell fainting into myarms."God bless you my boy" said the old general as he hurriedly wiped atear from his eye. "I am now indeed a happy father."                                   Tom Burke of "Ours"     In 1840 Charles Lever on an invitation from Sir John     Crompton Secretary to the British Embassy in Belgium forsook     Ireland for Brussels where for a time he followed his     profession of medicine. Two years later an offer of the     editorship of the "Dublin University Magazine" recalled him to     Ireland when he definitely abandoned a medical career and     settled down to literature permanently. The first fruit of     that appointment was "Tom Burke of Ours" published after     running serially in the magazine in 1844. It is more serious     in tone than any of his preceding works in it the author     utilises the rich colouring gained from his long residence in     France and the book is less remarkable for the complex if     vigorous story it contains than for its graphic and exciting     pictures of men and events in the campaigns of Napoleon Many     of its episodes are conceived in the true spirit of romance._I.--The Boy Rebel_"Be advised by me" said De Meudon earnestly "do not embark with theseIrish rebels in their enterprise They have none. Their only daring issome deed of rapine and murder. No liberty is not to be achieved bysuch bands as these. France is your country--there liberty has been wonthere lives one great man whose notice were it but passingly bestowedis fame."He sank back exhausted. The energy of his speech was too great for hisweak and exhausted frame to bear. Captain de Meudon had come to Irelandin 1798 to aid in the rebellion he had seen its failure but hadremained in Ireland trying vainly to give to the disaffection somemilitary organization. He had realized the hopelessness of his efforts.He was ill and very near to death. Now I stood by his bedside in alittle cottage in Glenmalure.Boy as I was I had already seen enough to make me a rebel in feelingand in action. I had stood a short time before the death-bed of myfather who disliked me and who had left nearly all his property to myelder brother who was indifferent to me. My father had indentured me asapprentice to his lawyer and sooner than submit to the rule of thisman--the evil genius of our family--I had taken flight. The companion ofmy wanderings was Darby M'Keown the piper the cleverest and cunningestof the agents of rebellion. Then I had met De Meudon who had turned mythoughts and ambitions into another channel.My companion grew steadily worse."Take my pocket-book" he whispered "there is a letter you'll give mysister Marie. There are some five or six thousand francs--they areyours you must be a pupil at the Polytechnique at Paris. If it should
comment975,be your fortune to speak with General Bonaparte say to him that whenCharles de Meudon was dying--in exile--with but one friend left--he heldhis portrait to his lips and with his last breath he kissed it."A shivering ran through his limbs--a sigh--and all was still. He wasdead."Halloa there" said a voice. The door opened and a sergeant entered."I have a warrant to arrest Captain de Meudon a French officer who isconcealed here. Where is he"I pointed to the bed."I arrest you in the king's name" said the sergeant approaching."What----" He started back in horror. "He is dead"Then entered one I had seen before--Major Barton the most pitiless ofthe government's agents in suppressing insurrection.The sergeant whispered to him and his eye ranged the little chambertill it fell on me."Ha" he cried. "You here Sergeant here's one prisoner for you at anyrate."Two soldiers seized me and I was marched away towards Dublin. Aboutnoon the party halted and the soldiers lay down and chatted on a patchof grass while my own thoughts turned sadly back to the friend I hadknown.Suddenly I heard a song sung by a voice I knew and afterwards a loudclapping of hands. Darby M'Keown was there in the midst of the soldiersand as I turned to look at him my hand came in contact with aclasp-knife. I managed with it to free my arms from the ropes thatfastened them but what was to be done next"I didn't think much of that song of yours" said one of the soldiers."Give us 'The British Grenadiers.'""I never heard them play but onst sir" said Darby meekly "and theywere in such a hurry I couldn't pick up the tune.""What d'you mean""'Twas the day but one after the French landed and the BritishGrenadiers was running away."The party sprang to their legs and a shower of curses fell upon thepiper."And sure" continued Darby "'twasn't my fault av they took to theirheels. Wouldn't anyone run for his life av he had the opportunity"These words were uttered in a raised voice and I took the hint. WhileDarby was scuffling with the soldiers I slipped away.For miles I pressed forward without turning and in the evening I foundmyself in Dublin. The union with England was being debated in theParliament House huge and angry crowds raged without. Remembering thetactics De Meudon had taught me I sought to organize the crowd in akind of military formation against the troops but a knock on the headwith a musket-butt ended my labours and I knew nothing more until Icame to myself in the quarters of an old chance acquaintance--CaptainBubbleton.Here in the house of this officer--an eccentric and impecunious manbut a most loyal friend--I was discovered by Major Barton and dragged toprison. I was released by the intervention of my father's lawyer who
comment976,claimed me as his apprentice.For weeks I lived with Captain Bubbleton and his brother officers andnothing could be more cordial than their treatment of me. "Tom Burke of'Ours'" the captain used proudly to call me. Only one officer heldaloof from me and from all Irishmen--Montague Crofts--through whom itcame about that I left Ireland.One day an uncouth and ragged woman entered the barracks and addressedme. It was Darby M'Keown and he brought me nothing less precious thanDe Meudon's pocket-book which had been taken from me and had beenpicked up by him on the road. A few minutes later Bubbleton lost a sumat cards to Crofts knowing he could not pay I passed a note quietly tohim. When Bubbleton had gone Crofts held up the note before me. It wasa French note of De Meudon's I demanded my property back. He refusedand threatened to inform against me. On my seeking to prevent him fromleaving the room he drew his sword and wounded me but in the nick oftime a blow from a strong arm laid him senseless--dead perhaps--on thefloor."We must be far from this by daybreak" whispered Darby.I walked out of the barracks as steadily as I could. For all I knew Iwas implicated in murder--and Ireland was no place for me. In a few daysI stood on the shores of France._II.--A Blow for the Emperor_By means of a letter of introduction to the head of the Polytechniquewhich De Meudon had placed for me in his pocket-book I was able toenter that military college and after a spell of earnest study I wasappointed to a commission in the Eighth Hussars. Proud as I was tobecome a soldier of France yet I could not but feel that I was aforeigner and almost friendless--unlucky indeed in the choice of thefew friends I possessed. Chief of them was the Marquis de Beauvaisconcerning whom I soon made two discoveries--that he was in the thick ofan intrigue against the republic I served and its First Consul andthat he was in love with Marie de Meudon my dead friend's sister.To her as soon as an opportunity came I gave the news of her brother'send and his last message. She was terribly affected and the love webore in common to the dead and her own wonderful beauty aroused in mea passion that was not the less fervent because I felt it was almosthopeless. I did not dare to ask her love but I had her friendshipwithout asking. She it was who warned me of the dangerous intrigues ofDe Beauvais and his associates. She it was who when I fell a victim totheir intrigues laboured with General d'Auvergne who had befriended mewhile I was at college to restore me to liberty.I had heard that De Beauvais and his fellow royalists were plotting in achteau near Versailles and that a scheme was afoot to capture them. Inhot haste I rode to the chteau hoping secretly to warn my friend. Hedid indeed escape but it was my lot to be caught with the conspirators.For the second time in my short life I saw the inside of a prison I wasin danger of the guillotine despair had almost overpowered me when Ilearnt that my friends had prevailed--my sword was returned to me. Ibecame again an officer of the army of him who was now emperor and I
comment977,set forth determined to wipe out on the battlefield the doubts thatstill clung to my loyalty. Marie de Meudon was wedded by the emperor'swish to the gallant and beloved soldier on whose staff I proudlyserved--General d'Auvergne.In four vast columns of march the mighty army poured into the heart ofGermany. But not until we reached Mannheim did we learn the object ofthe war. We were to destroy the Austro-Russian coalition and the firstblow was to be struck at Ulm. When Ulm had capitulated Generald'Auvergne and his staff returned to Elchingen and on the night when wereached the place I was on the point of lying down supperless in theopen air when I met an old acquaintance Corporal Pioche a giantcuirassier of the Guard who had fought in all Bonaparte's campaigns."Ah mon lieutenant" said he "not supped yet I'll wager. Come alongwith me Mademoiselle Minette has opened her canteen"Presently we entered a large room at one end of which sat a very prettyParisian brunette who bade me a gracious welcome. The place was crowdedwith captains and corporals lieutenants and sergeants all hobnobbinghand-shaking and even kissing each other. "Each man brings what he canfind drinks what he is able and leaves the rest" remarked Pioche andinvited me to take my share in the common stock.All went well until I absent-mindedly called out as if to a waiter forbread. There was a roar of laughter at my mistake and a littledark-whiskered fellow stuck his sword into a loaf and handed it to me.As I took the loaf he disengaged his point and scratched the back ofmy hand with it. Obviously an insult was intended."Ah an accident _morbleu_" said he with an impertinent shrug."So is this" said I as I seized his sword and smashed it across myknee."It's Franois _maitre d'armes_ of the Fourth" whispered Pioche "oneof the cleverest duellists of the army."I was hurried out to the court one adviser counselling me to beware ofFranois's lunge in tierce another to close on him at once and so on.For a long time after we had crossed swords I remained purely on thedefensive at last after a desperate rally he made a lunge at mychest which I received in the muscles of my back and wheeling roundI buried my blade in his body.Franois lingered for a long time between life and death and forseveral days I was incapacitated tenderly nursed by Minette.As soon as I was recovered the order came to advance.Not many days passed ere the chance came to me for which I had longed--the chance of striking a blow for the emperor. Hand-to-hand with theRussian dragoons on the field of Austerlitz sweeping along afterwardswith the imperial hosts in the full tide of victory I learnt for thefirst time the exhilaration of military glory and I had the goodfortune to receive the emperor's favour--not only was I promoted but Iwas appointed to the _compagnie d'lite_ that was to carry the spoils ofvictory to Paris.A few weeks after my return to Paris the whole garrison was placed inreview order to receive the wounded of Austerlitz.As the emperor rode forward bareheaded to greet his maimed veterans I
comment978,heard laughter among the staff that surrounded him. Stepping up I sawmy old friend Pioche who had been dangerously wounded with his hand insalute."Thou wilt not have promotion nor a pension" said Napoleon smiling."Hast any friend whom I could advance""Yes" answered Pioche scratching his forehead in confusion. "She is abrave girl and had she been a man----""Whom can he mean""I was talking of Minette our _vivandire_.""Dost wish I should make her my aide-de-camp" said Napoleon laughing."_Parbleu_ Thou hast more ill-favoured ones among them" said Piochewith a glance at the grim faces of Rapp and Daru. "I've seen the timewhen thou'd have said 'Is it Minette that was wounded at the Adige andstood in the square at Marengo I'll give her the Cross of the Legion'""And she shall have it" said Napoleon. Minette advanced and as theemperor's own cross was attached to her buttonhole she sat pale asdeath overcome by her pride.For two hours waggon after waggon rolled on filled with the shatteredremnants of an army. Every eye brightened as the emperor drew near thefeeblest gazed with parted lips when he spoke and the faint cry of"_Vive l'Empreur_" passed along the line._III.--Broken Dreams_Ere I had left Paris to join in the campaign against Prussia I hadmade and broken off another dangerous friendship. In the _compagnied'lite_ was an officer named Duchesne who took a liking to me--aroyalist at heart and a cynic who was unfailing in his sneers at allthe doings of Napoleon. His attitude was detected and he was forced toresign his commission and his slights upon the uniform I wore grew sounbearable that I abandoned his company--little guessing the revenge hewould take upon me.Once more the Grand Army was set in motion and the hosts of Francepressed upon Russia from the south and west. Napoleon turned the enemy'sright flank and compelled him to retire and concentrate his troopsaround Jena which was plainly to be the scene of a great battle.My regiment was ordered on September 13 1806 to proceed without delayto the emperor's headquarters at Jena and I was sent ahead to makearrangements for quarters. In the darkness I lost my way and came uponan artillery battery stuck fast in a ravine unable to move back orforwards. The colonel was in despair for the whole artillery of thedivision was following him and would inevitably be involved in the samemishap. Wild shouting had been succeeded by a sullen silence when astern voice called out "Cannoniers dismount bring the torches to thefront"When the order was obeyed the light of the firewood fell upon thefeatures of Napoleon himself. Instantly the work began afresh directedby the emperor with a blazing torch in his hand. Gradually thegun-carriages were released and began to move slowly along the ravine.Napoleon turned and rode off at full speed in the darkness towardsJena. It was my destination and I followed him.He preceded me by about fifty paces--the greatest monarch of the worldalone his thoughts bent on the great events before him. On the top ofan ascent the brilliant spectacle of a thousand watch-fires met the eye.Napoleon lost in meditation saw nothing and rode straight into thelines. Twice the challenge "_Qui vive"_ rang out. Napoleon heard itnot. There was a bang of a musket then another and another. Napoleonthrew himself from his horse and lay flat on the ground. I dashed upshouting "The emperor The emperor" My horse was killed and I waswounded in the shoulder but I repeated the cry until Napoleon steppedcalmly forward."Ye are well upon the alert _mes enfants_" he said smiling. Thenturning to me he asked quickly "Are you wounded""A mere scratch sire.""Let the surgeon see to it and do you come to headquarters when you areable."In the morning I went to headquarters but the emperor was busyseemingly I was forgotten. My regiment was out of reach so at theinvitation of my old duelling antagonist Franois I joined theVoltigeurs. My friends could not understand why after tasting the
comment979,delights of infantry fighting I should wish to rejoin the hussars butI went back to my old regiment after the victory and rode with it toBerlin.Soon after our arrival there I read my name in a general order amongthose on whom the Cross of the Legion was to be conferred. On themorning of the day when I was to receive the decoration I was requestedto attend the bureau of the adjutant-general. There I was confrontedwith Marshal Berthier who held up a letter before me. I saw by thehandwriting it was Duchesne's."There sir that letter belongs to you" he said. "There is enough init to make your conduct the matter of a court-martial but I amsatisfied that a warning will be sufficient. I need hardly say that youwill not receive the Cross of the Legion."I glanced at the letter and realised Duchesne's treachery. Knowing thatall doubtful letters were opened and read by the authorities he hadsent me a letter bitterly attacking the emperor and professing toregard me as a royalist conspirator.Exasperated I drew my sword."I resign sir" I said. "The career I can no longer follow honourablyand independently I shall follow no more."With a half-broken heart and faltering step I regained my quarters thewhole dream of life was over. Broken in spirit I made my way slowlyback through Germany to Paris and back to Ireland._IV.--The Call of the Sword_On reaching my native country I found that my brother had died and thatI had inherited an income of 4000 a year. I sought to forget the past.But a time came when I could resist the temptation no longer and thefirst fact I read of was the burning of Moscow. As misfortune followedmisfortune an impulse came to me that it was useless to resist. Myheart was among the glittering squadrons of France. I thought suddenlywas this madness And the thought was followed by a resolve as sudden. Iwrote some lines to my agent saddled my horse and rode away. AtVerviers I offered my sword to the emperor as an old officer and wentforward in charge of a squadron to Brienne. This place was held by thePrussians and Blcher and his Prussians were near at hand. Once more Ibeheld the terrific spectacle of an attack by the army of Napoleon. Butalas the attack was vain I heard the trumpet sound a retreat. And as Iturned I saw the body of an aged general officer among a heap of slain.With a shriek of horror I recognized the friend of my heart Generald'Auvergne. Round his neck he wore a locket with a portrait of hiswife--Marie de Meudon. I detached the locket and bade the dead a lastadieu.Why should I dwell on a career of disaster Retreat followed retreatuntil the fate of Napoleon's empire depended on the capture of thebridge of Montereau. Regiment after regiment strove to cross only to beshattered and mangled by the tremendous fire of the enemy. Four sappersat length laid a petard beneath the gate at the other side of thebridge. But the fuse went out."This to the man who lights the fuse" cried Napoleon holding up hisgreat Cross of the Legion.I snatched a burning match from a gunner beside me and rushed acrossthe bridge. Partly protected by the high projecting parapet I lit thefuse and then fell shot in the chest. My senses reeled for a time Iknew nothing then I felt a flask pressed to my lips. I looked up andsaw Minette. "Dear dear girl what a brave heart is thine" said I asshe pressed her handkerchief to my wound.Her fingers became entangled in the ribbon of the general's locket thatI had tied round my neck and by accident the locket opened. She becamedeathly pale as she saw its contents then springing to her feet shegave me one glance--fleeting but how full of sorrow--and ran to themiddle of the bridge. The petard had done its work. She beckoned to thecolumn to come on they answered with a cheer. Presently four grenadiers
comment980,fell to the rear carrying between them the body of Minette.They gave her a military funeral and I was told that a giant soldier acorporal it was thought kneeled down to kiss her before she was coveredwith the earth then lay quietly down in the grass. When they sought tomove him he was stone dead.When I had recovered from my wound it was nothing to me that Napoleonbesides giving me his Grand Cross had made me general of brigade. ForNapoleon was no longer emperor and I would not serve the king whosucceeded him. But ere I left France I saw Marie de Meudon it might beI thought for the last time. At the sight of her my old passionreturned and I dared to utter it. I know not how incoherently the talewas told I can but remember the bursting feeling of my bosom as sheplaced her hand in mine and said "It is yours."                                   M.G. LEWISAmbrosio or the Monk     There was a time--of no great duration--when Lewis' "Monk" was     the most popular book in England. At the end of the eighteenth     century the vogue of the "Gothic" romance of ghosts and     mysteries was at its height and this work written in ten     weeks by a young man of nineteen caught the public fancy     tremendously and Matthew Gregory Lewis was straightway     accepted as an adept at making the flesh creep. Taste changes     in horrors as in other things and "Ambrosio or The Monk"     would give nightmares to few modern readers. Its author who     was born in London on July 9 1775 and published "The Monk"     in 1795 wrote many supernatural tales and poems and also     several plays--one of which "The Castle Spectre" caused the     hair of Drury Lane audiences to stand on end for sixty     successive nights a long run in those days. Lewis who was a     wealthy man sat for some years in Parliament he had many     distinguished friends among men of letters--Scott and Southey     contributed largely to the first volume of his "Tales of     Wonder." He died on May 13 1818._I.--The Recluse_The Church of the Capuchins in Madrid had never witnessed a morenumerous assembly than that which gathered to hear the sermon ofAmbrosio the abbot. All Madrid rang with his praises. Broughtmysteriously to the abbey door while yet an infant he had remained forall the thirty years of his life within its precincts. All his days hadbeen spent in seclusion study and mortification of the flesh hisknowledge was profound his eloquence most persuasive his only faultwas an excess of severity in judging the human feelings from which hehimself was exempted.Among the crowd that pressed into the church were two women--oneelderly the other young--who had seats offered them by two richlyhabited cavaliers. The younger cavalier Don Lorenzo discovered suchexquisite beauty and sweetness in the maiden to whom he had given hisseat--her name was Antonia--that when she left the church he wasdesperately in love with her.He had promised to see his sister Agnes a nun in the Convent of St.Clare so he remained in the church whither the nuns were presently tocome to confess to the Abbot Ambrosio. As he waited he observed a manwrapped up in a cloak hurriedly place a letter beneath a statue of St.Francis and then retire.The nuns entered and removed their veils out of respect to the saint towhom the building was dedicated. One of the nuns dropped her rosarybeside the statue and as she stooped to pick it up she dexterouslyremoved the letter and placed it in her bosom. As she did so the light
comment981,flashed full in her face."Agnes by Heaven" cried Lorenzo.He hastened after the cloaked stranger and overtook him with drawnsword. Suddenly the cloaked man turned and exclaimed "Is it possibleLorenzo have you forgotten Raymond de las Cisternas""You here marquis" said the astonished Lorenzo. "You engaged in aclandestine correspondence with my sister""Her affections have ever been mine and not the Church's. She enteredthe convent tricked into a belief that I had been false to her but Ihave proved to her that it is otherwise. She had agreed to fly with meand my uncle the cardinal is securing for her a dispensation from hervows."Raymond told at length the story of his love and at the end Lorenzosaid "Raymond there is no one on whom I would bestow Agnes morewillingly than on yourself. Pursue your design and I will accompanyyou."Meanwhile Agnes tremblingly advanced toward the abbot and in hernervousness let fall the precious letter. She turned to pick it up. Theabbot claimed and read it it was the proposal of Agnes's escape withher lover that very night."This letter must to the prioress" said he sternly."Hold father hold" cried Agnes flinging herself at his feet. "Bemerciful Do not doom me to destruction""Hence unworthy wretch Where is the prioress"The prioress when she came gazed upon Agnes with fury. "Away with herto the convent" she exclaimed."Oh Raymond save me save me" shrieked the distracted Agnes. Thencasting upon the abbot a frantic look "Hear me" she continued "man ofa hard heart Insolent in your yet unshaken virtue your day of trialwill arrive. Think then upon your cruelty and despair of pardon"_II.--The Abbot's Infatuation_Leaving the church Ambrosio bent his steps towards a grotto in theabbey garden formed in imitation of a hermitage. On reaching thegrotto he found it already occupied. Extended upon one of the seatslay a man in a melancholy posture lost in meditation. Ambrosiorecognised him it was Rosario his favourite novice a youth of whoseorigin none knew anything save that his bearing and such of hisfeatures as accident had discovered--for he seemed fearful of beingrecognised and was continually muffled up in his cowl--proved him to beof noble birth."You must not indulge this disposition to melancholy Rosario" saidAmbrosio tenderly.The youth flung himself at Ambrosio's feet."Oh pity me" he cried. "How willingly would I unveil to you my heartBut I fear------""How shall I reassure you Reveal to me what afflicts you and I swearthat your secret shall be safe in my keeping.""Father" said Rosario in faltering accents "I am a woman"The abbot stood still for a moment in astonishment then turned hastilyto go. But the suppliant clasped his knees."Do not fly me" she cried. "You are my beloved but far is it fromMatilda's wish to draw you from the paths of virtue. All I ask is to see
comment982,you to converse with you to adore you"Confusion and resentment mingled in Ambrosio's mind with secret pleasurethat a young and lovely woman had thus for his sake abandoned the world.But he recognised the need for austerity."Matilda" he said "you must leave the abbey to-morrow.""Cruel cruel" she exclaimed wringing her hands in agony. "Farewellmy friend And yet methinks I would fain bear with me some token ofyour regard.""What shall I give you""Anything--one of those flowers will be sufficient."Ambrosio approached a bush and stooped to pick one of the flowers. Heuttered a piercing cry and Matilda rushed towards him."A serpent" he said in a faint voice "concealed among the roses."With loud shrieks the distressed Matilda summoned assistance. Ambrosiowas carried to the abbey his wound was examined and the surgeonpronounced that there was no hope. He had been stung by a centipedoroand would not live three days.Mournfully the monks left the bedside and Ambrosio was entrusted to thecare of the despairing Matilda. Next morning the surgeon was astonishedto find that the inflammation had subsided and when he probed the woundno traces of the venom were perceptible."A miracle A miracle" cried the monks. Joyfully they proclaimed thatSt. Francis had saved the life of their sainted abbot.But Ambrosio was still weak and languid and again the monks left him inMatilda's care. As he listened to an old ballad sung by her sweet voicehe found renewed pleasure in her society and was conscious of theinfluence upon him of her beauty. For three days she nursed him whilehe watched her with increasing fondness. But on the next day she camenot. A lay-brother entered instead."Hasten reverend father" said he. "Young Rosario lies at the point ofdeath and he earnestly requests to see you."In deep agitation he followed the lay-brother to Matilda's apartment.Her face glowed at the sight of him. "Leave me my brethren" she saidto the monks much have I to tell this holy man in private.""Father I am poisoned" she said when they had gone "but the poisononce circulated in your veins.""Matilda""I loosened the bandage from your arm I drew out the poison with mylips. I feel death at my heart.""And you have sacrificed yourself for me Is there indeed no hope""There is but one means of life in my power--a dangerous and dreadfulmeans life would be purchased at too dear a rate--unless it werepermitted me to live for you.""Then live for me" cried the infatuated monk clasping her in his arms."Live for me""Then" she cried joyfully "no dangers shall appall me. Swear that you
comment983,will never inquire by what means I shall preserve myself and procurefor me the key of the burying-ground common to us and the sisterhood ofSt. Clare."When Ambrosio had obtained the key Matilda left him. She returnedradiant with joy."I have succeeded" she cried. "I shall live Ambrosio--shall live foryou"_III.--Unavailing Remorse_Raymond and Lorenzo had gone to the rendezvous appointed in the letterand had waited to be joined by Agnes and to enable her to escape fromthe convent.But Agnes had not come and the two friends withdrew in deepmortification. Presently arrived a message from Raymond's uncle thecardinal enclosing the Pope's bull ordering that Agnes should bereleased from her vows and restored to her relatives. Lorenzo at onceconveyed the bull to the prioress."It is out of my power to obey this order" said she in a voice ofanger which she strove in vain to disguise. "Agnes is dead"Lorenzo hastened with the fatal news to Raymond whose terribleaffliction led to a dangerous illness.One morning as Ambrosio was leaving the chapel after listening to manypenitents--he was the favourite confessor in Madrid--Antonia steppedtimidly up to him and begged him to visit her mother who was stretchedon a bed of sickness. Charmed with her beauty and innocence heconsented.The monk retired to his cell whither he was pursued by Antonia's image."What would be too dear a price" he meditated "for this lovely girl'saffections"Not once but often did Ambrosio visit Antonia and her mother and eachtime he saw the innocent girl his love increased. Matilda who had firstopened his heart to love saw the change and penetrated his secret."Since your love can no longer be mine" she said to him sadly "Irequest the next best gift--your confidence and friendship. You loveAntonia but you love her despairingly. I come to point out the road tosuccess.""Oh impossible""To those who dare nothing is impossible. Listen My guardian was a manof uncommon knowledge and from him I had training in the arts of magic.One terrible power he gave me--the power of raising a demon. I shudderedat the thought of employing it until it became my only means of savingmy life--a life that you prized. For your sake I performed the mysticrites in the sepulchre of St. Clare. For your sake I will perform themagain.""No no Matilda" cried the monk "I will not ally myself with God'senemy.""Look" Matilda held before him a mirror of polished steel its borders
comment984,marked with various strange characters. A mist spread over the surfaceit cleared and Ambrosio gazed upon the countenance of Antonia in allits beauty."I yield" he cried passionately. "Matilda I follow you"They passed into the churchyard they reached the entry to the vaultsAmbrosio tremblingly followed Matilda down the staircase. They wentthrough narrow passages strewn with skulls and bones and reached aspacious cavern. Matilda drew a circle around herself and anotheraround him bending low she muttered a few indistinct sentences and athin blue sulphurous flame arose from the ground.Suddenly she uttered a piercing shriek and plunged a poniard into herleft arm the blood poured down a dark cloud arose and a clap ofthunder was heard. Then a full strain of melodious music sounded and thedemon stood before them.He was a youth of perfect face and form. Crimson wings extended from hisshoulders many-coloured fires played about his locks but there was awildness in his eyes a mysterious melancholy in his features thatbetrayed the fallen angel.Matilda conversed with him in unintelligible language he bowedsubmissively and gave to her a silver branch imitating myrtle that hebore in his right hand. The music was heard again and ceased the cloudspread itself afresh the demon vanished."With this branch" said Matilda "every door will open before you. Youmay gain access to Antonia a touch of the branch will send her into adeep sleep and you may carry her away whither you will."Ashamed and fearful yet borne away by his love the monk set forth. Thebolts of Antonia's house flew back and the doors opened before thesilver myrtle.But as he passed stealthily through the house a woman confronted him. Itwas Antonia's mother roused by a fearful dream."Monster of hypocrisy" she cried in fury. "I had already suspected youbut I kept silence. Now I will unmask you villain""Forgive me lady" begged the terrified monk. "I swear by all that isholy------""No All Madrid shall shudder at your perfidy."He turned to fly. She seized him and screamed for help. He graspedher by the throat with all his strength strangled her and flung her tothe ground where she lay motionless. After a minute of horror-struckshuddering the murderer fled. He entered the abbey unobserved andhaving shut himself into his cell he abandoned his soul to the torturesof unavailing remorse._IV.--A Living Death_"Do not despair" counselled Matilda when the monk revealed hisfailure. "Your crime is unsuspected. Antonia may still be yours. Theprioress of St. Clare has a mysterious liquor the effect of which is togive those who drink it the appearance of death for three days. Procure
comment985,some of this liquor visit Antonia and cause her to drink it have herbody conveyed to a sepulchre in the vaults of St. Clare."Ambrosio hastened to secure a phial of the mysterious potion. He went tocomfort Antonia in her distress and contrived to pour a few drops fromthe phial into a draught that she was taking. In a few hours he heardthat she was dead and her body was conveyed to the vaults.Meanwhile Lorenzo had learned not indeed that his sister was alivebut that she had been the victim of terrible cruelty. A nun who hadbeen Agnes's friend hinted at atrocious vengeance taken by the prioressfor Agnes's attempt to escape. She suggested that Lorenzo should bringthe officers of the Inquisition with him and arrest the prioress duringa public procession of the nuns in honour of St Clare.Accordingly as the prioress passed along the street among her nuns witha devout and sanctified air the officers advanced and arrested her."Ah" she cried frantically "I am betrayed""Betrayed" replied the nun who had revealed the secret to Lorenzo. "Icharge the prioress with murder"She told how Agnes had been secretly poisoned by the prioress. The mobmad with indignation rushed to the convent determined to destroy it.Lorenzo and the officers hastened to endeavour to do what they could tosave the convent and the terrified nuns who had taken refuge there.Antonia's heart throbbed her eyes opened she raised herself and cast awild look around her. Her clothing was a shroud she lay in a coffinamong other coffins in a damp and hideous vault. Confronting her with alantern in his hand and eyeing her greedily stood Ambrosio."Where am I" she said abruptly. "How came I here Let me go""Why these terrors Antonia" replied the abbot. "What fear you fromme--from one who adores you You are imagined dead society is for everlost to you. You are absolutely in my power"She screamed and strove to escape he clutched at her and struggled todetain her. Suddenly Matilda entered in haste."The mob has set fire to the convent" she said to Ambrosio "and theabbey is in danger. Don Lorenzo and the officers are searching the
comment986,vaults. You cannot escape you must remain here. They may not perhapsenter this vault."Antonia heard that rescue was at hand."Help help" she screamed and ran out of the vault. The abbot pursuedher in desperation he caught her he could not stifle her cries.Frantic in his desire to escape he grasped Matilda's dagger plunged ittwice in the bosom of Antonia and fled back to the vault. It was toolate he had been seen the glare of torches filled the vault andAmbrosio and Matilda were seized and bound by the officers of theInquisition.Meanwhile Lorenzo running to and fro had flashed his lantern upon acreature so wretched so emaciated that he doubted to think her woman.He stopped petrified with horror."Two days and yet no food" she moaned. "No hope no comfort" Suddenlyshe looked up and addressed him."Do you bring me food or do you bring me death""I come" he replied "to relieve your sorrows.""God is it possible Oh yes Yes it is"--she fainted. Lorenzocarried her in his arms to the nuns above.Loud shrieks summoned him below again. Hastening after the officers hesaw a woman bleeding on the ground. He went to her it was his belovedAntonia. She was dying with a few sweet words of farewell her spiritpassed away.Broken-hearted he returned. He had lost Antonia but he was to learnthat Agnes was restored to him. The woman he had rescued was indeed hissister saved from a living death and brought back to life and love._V.--Lucifer_Ambrosio was tortured into confession and condemned to be burned at thestake. Matilda terrified at the sight of her fellow-criminal'storments confessed without torture and was sentenced to be burned athis side.They were to perish at midnight and as the monk in panic-strickendespair awaited the awful hour suddenly Matilda stood before himbeautifully attired with a look of wild pleasure in her eyes."Matilda" he cried "how have you gained entrance""Ambrosio" she replied "I am free. For life and liberty I have sold mysoul to Lucifer. Dare you do the same"The monk shuddered."I cannot renounce my God" he said."Fool What hope have you of God's mercy" She handed him a book. "Ifyou repent of your folly read the first four lines in the seventh pagebackwards." She vanished.A fearful struggle raged in the monk's spirit. What hope had he in anycase of escaping eternal torment And yet--was not the Almighty's mercyinfinite Then the thought of the stake and the flames entered his mindand appalled him.At last the fatal hour came. The steps of his gaolers were heard in the
comment987,passage. In uttermost terror he opened the book and ran over the linesand straightway the fiend appeared--not seraph-like as when he appearedformerly but dark hideous and gigantic with hissing snakes coilingaround his brows.He placed a parchment before Ambrosio."Bear me hence" cried the monk."Will you be mine body and soul" said the demon. "Resolve while thereis time""I must""Sign then" Lucifer thrust a pen into the flesh of Ambrosio's arm andthe monk signed. A moment later he was carried through the roof of thedungeon into mid-air.The demon bore him with arrow-like speed to the brink of a precipice inthe Sierra Morena."Carry me to Matilda" gasped the monk."Wretch" answered Lucifer. "For what did you stipulate but rescue fromthe Inquisition Learn that when you signed the steps in the corridorwere the steps of those who were bringing you a pardon. But now you aremine beyond reprieve to all eternity and alive you quit not thesemountains."Darting his talons into the monk's shaven crown he sprang with him fromthe rock. From a dreadful height he flung him headlong and the torrentbore away with it the shattered corpse of Ambrosio.                                   ELIZA LYNN LINTONJoshua Davidson     Mrs. Lynn Linton daughter of a vicar of Crosthwaite was born at     Keswick England Feb. 10 1822. At the age of three-and-twenty     she embarked on a literary career and as a journalist     magazine contributor and novelist wrote vigorously for over     fifty years. Before her marriage in 1858 to W.J. Linton the     eminent wood-engraver who was also a poet she had served on     the staff of the "Morning Chronicle" as Paris correspondent.     Later she contributed to "All the Year Round" and to the     "Saturday Review." After nine years of married life the     Lintons parted amicably. In 1872 Mrs. Lynn Linton published     "The True History of Joshua Davidson" a powerfully simple     story that has had much influence on working-class thought.     "Christopher Kirkland" a later story is largely     autobiographical. Mrs. Linton died in London on July 14 1898.     She was a trenchant critic of what she regarded as tendencies
comment988,     towards degeneration in modern women._I.--A Cornish Christ_Joshua Davidson was the only son of a village carpenter born in thesmall hamlet of Trevalga on the North Cornwall coast in the year 1835.There was nothing very remarkable about Joshua's childhood. He wasalways a quiet thoughtful boy and from his earliest years noticeablypious. He had a habit of asking why and of reasoning out a principlefrom quite a little lad which displeased people so that he did not getall the credit from the schoolmaster and the clergyman to which hisdiligence and good conduct entitled him.He was never well looked on by the vicar since a famous scene that tookplace in the church one Sunday. After catechism was over Joshua stoodout before the rest just in his rough country clothes as he was andsaid very respectfully to the vicar "Mr. Grand if you please I wouldlike to ask you a few questions.""Certainly my lad. What have you to say" said Mr. Grand rathershortly."If we say sir that Jesus Christ was God" said Joshua "surely allthat He said and did must be real right There cannot be a better waythan His""Surely not my lad" Mr. Grand made answer."And His apostles and disciples they showed the way too" said Joshua."And they showed the way too as you say and if you come up to halfthey taught you'll do well Joshua."The vicar laughed a little laugh as he said this but it was a laughJoshua's mother said that seemed to mean the same thing as a "scat"--our Cornish word for a blow--only the boy didn't seem to see it."Yes but sir if we are Christians why don't we live as Christians"said Joshua."Ah indeed why don't we" said Mr. Grand. "Because of the wickednessof the human heart because of the world the flesh and the devil.""Then sir if you feel this why don't you and all the clergy live likethe apostles and give what you have to the poor" cried Joshuaclasping his hands and making a step forward the tears in his eyes."Why do you live in a fine house and have grand dinners and let PeggyBray nearly starve in that old mud hut of hers and Widow Tregellisthere with her six children and no fire or clothing for them I can'tmake it out sir""Who has been putting these bad thoughts into your head" said Mr. Grandsternly."No one sir. I have been thinking for myself. Michael out by Lion'sDen is called an infidel--he calls himself one. And you preached lastSunday that no infidel can be saved. But Michael helped Peggy and herchild when the orphan fund people took away her pension and he workedearly and late for Widow Tregellis and her children and shared withthem all he had going short for them many a time. And I can't helpthinking sir that Christ would have helped Peggy and that Michaelbeing an infidel and such a good man is something like that second sonin the parable who said he would not do his Lord's will when he wasordered but who went all the same------""And that your vicar is like the first" interrupted Mr. Grand angrily."Well yes sir if you please" said Joshua quite modestly but veryfervently.There was a stir among the ladies and gentlemen when Joshua said thisand some laughed a little under their breath and others lifted uptheir eyebrows and said "What an extraordinary boy" But Mr. Grand wasvery angry and said in a severe tone "These things are beyond theknowledge of an ignorant lad like you Joshua. I consider you have donea very impertinent thing to-day and I shall mark you for it""I meant no harm. I meant only the truth and to hear the things of God"repeated Joshua sadly as he took his seat among his companions whotittered.And so Joshua was not well looked on by the clergyman who was hisenemy as one may say ever after.
comment989,"Mother" said Joshua "I mean when I grow up to live as our Lord andSaviour lived when He was on the earth.""He is our example lad" said his mother. "But I doubt lest you fall byover-boldness."_II.--Faith That Moveth Mountains_Joshua did not leave home early. He wrought at his father's bench andwas content to bide with his people. But his spirit was not dead if hislife was uneventful. He gathered about him a few youths of his own ageand held with them prayer-meetings and Bible readings either at home inhis father's house or in the fields when the throng was too great forthe cottage.No one ever knew Joshua tell the shadow of a lie or go back from hisword or play at pretence. And he had such an odd way of coming righthome to us. He seemed to have felt all that we felt and to have thoughtall our thoughts.The youths that Joshua got together as his friends were aswell-conditioned a set of lads as you would wish to see--soberindustrious chaste. Their aim was to be thorough and like Christ.Joshua's great hope was to bring back the world to the simplicity andbroad humanity of Christ's acted life and he could not understand howit had been let drop.He was but a young man at this time remember--enthusiastic with littleor no scientific knowledge and putting the direct interposition of Godabove the natural law. Wherefore he accepted the text about faithremoving mountains as literally true. And one evening he went down intothe Rocky Valley earnest to try conclusions with God's promise andsure of proving it true.He prayed to God to grant us this manifestation--to redeem His promise.Not a shadow of doubt chilled or slacked him. As he stood there in thesoftening twilight with his arms raised above his head and his faceturned up to the sky his countenance glowed as Moses' of old. He seemedinspired transported beyond himself beyond humanity.He commanded the stone to move in God's name and because Christ hadpromised. But the rock stood still and a stonechat went and perched onit.Another time he took up a viper in his hand quoting the passage "Theyshall take up serpents." But the beast stung him and he was ill fordays after."Take my advice" said the doctor. "Put all these thoughts out of yourhead. Get some work to do in a new part of the country fall in lovewith some nice girl and marry as soon as you can make a home for her.That's the only life for you depend upon it.""God has given me other thoughts" said Joshua "and I must obey them."The doctor said afterwards that he was quite touched at the lad'ssweetness and wrong-headedness combined.The failure of these trials of faith perplexed us all and profoundlyafflicted Joshua. "Friends" he said at last "it seems to me--indeed Ithink we must all see it now--that His Word is not to be acceptedliterally. The laws of nature are supreme and even faith cannot changethem. Can it be" he then said solemnly "that much of the Word is aparable--that Christ was truly as He says of Himself the corner-stonebut not the whole building--and that we have to carry on the work in Hisspirit but in our own way and not merely to try and repeat His acts"It was after this that we noticed a certain restlessness in Joshua. Butin time he had an offer to go up to London to follow his trade at alarge house in the City and got me a job as well that I might bealongside of him. For we were like brothers. A few days before he went
comment990,Joshua happened to be coming out of his father's workshop just as Mr.Grand was passing driving the neat pair-horse phaeton he had latelybought."Well Joshua and how are you doing And why have you not been tochurch lately" said the parson pulling up."Well sir" said Joshua "I don't go to church you know.""A new light on your own account hey" and he laughed as if he mockedhim."No sir only a seeker.""The old path's not good enough for you""I must answer for my conscience to God sir" said Joshua."And your clergyman appointed by God and the state to be your guidewhat of him Has he no authority in his own parish""Look here sir" said Joshua quite respectfully "I deny yourappointment as a God-given leader of souls. The Church is but the oldpriesthood as it existed in the days of our Lord. I see no sacrifice ofthe world no brotherhood with the poor----""The poor" interrupted Mr. Grand disdainfully. "What would you haveyou young fool The poor have the laws of their country to protect themand the Gospel preached to them for their salvation.""Why sir the poor of our day are the lepers of Christ's and who amongyou Christian priests consorts with them Who ranks the man above hisstation or the soul above the man""Now we have come to it" cried Mr. Grand. "I thought I should touch thesecret spring at last And you would like us to associate with you asequals--is that it Joshua Gentlemen and common men hob-and-nobtogether and no distinctions made You to ride in our carriages andperhaps marry our daughters""That's just it sir. You are gentlemen as you say but not thefollowers of Christ. If you were you would have no carriages to ridein and your daughters would be what Martha and Mary and Lydia andDorcas were and their title to ladyhood founded on their degrees ofgoodness.""Shall I tell you what would be the very thing for you" said Mr. Grandquite quietly."Yes sir what" asked Joshua eagerly."This whip across your shoulders And by George if I were not aclergyman I would lay it there with a will" cried the parson.No one had ever seen Joshua angry since he had grown up. His temper was
comment991,proverbially sweet and his self-control was a marvel. But this time helost both."God shall smite thee thou white wall" he cried with vehemence. "Youare the gentleman sir and I am only a poor carpenter's son but Ispurn you with a deeper and more solemn scorn than you have spurned me"He lifted his hand as he said this with a strange and passionategesture then turned himself about and went in and Mr. Grand drove offmore his ill-wisher than before. He also made old Davidson Joshua'sfather suffer for his son for he took away his custom from him anddid him what harm in the neighbourhood a gentleman's ill word can do aworking man._III.--Is Christ's Way Livable_In London a new view of life opened to Joshua. The first thing thatstruck him in our workshop was the avowed infidelity of the workmen.Distrust had penetrated to their inmost souls. Christianity representsto the poor not Christ tender to the sinful visiting the leprous thebrother of publicans at Whose feet sat the harlots and were comfortedbut the gentleman taking sides with God against the poor and oppressedan elder brother in the courts of heaven kicking the younger out ofdoors.At this time Joshua's mind was like an unpiloted vessel. He was besetwith doubts in which the only thing that kept its shape or place wasthe character of Christ. For the rest everything had failed him. Duringthis time he did not neglect what I suppose may be called the secularlife. He attended all such science classes as he had time for and beingnaturally quick in study he picked up a vast deal of knowledge in avery short time he interested himself in politics in current socialquestions specially those relating to labour and capital and in thecondition of the poor.So his time passed till at last one evening "Friends" he said "Ihave at last cleared my mind and come to a belief. I have proved tomyself the sole meaning of Christ it is humanity. The modern Christwould be a politician. His aim would be to raise the whole platform ofsociety. He would work at the destruction of caste which is the vice atthe root of all our creeds and institutions. He would accept the truthsof science and He would teach that a man saves his own soul best byhelping his neighbour. Friends the doctrine I have chosen for myself isChristian Communism and my aim will be the life after Christ in theservice of humanity."It was this which made him begin his "night school" where he gottogether all who would come and tried to interest them in a few homelytruths in the way of cleanliness health good cooking and the likewith interludes so to speak of lessons in morality.We lodged in a stifling court Church Court where every room was filledas if cubic inches were gold as indeed they are to London house-ownersif human life is but dross. Opposite us lived Mary Prinsep who was what
comment992,the world calls lost--a bad girl--a castaway--but I have reason to speakwell of her for to her we owe the life of Joshua. Joshua fell ill inour wretched lodgings where we lived and did for ourselves and I wasobliged to leave him for twelve hours and more at a stretch but MaryPrinsep came over and nursed him and kept him alive. We helped her allwe could and she helped us. This got us the name of associating withbad women.Among the rest of the doubtful characters with which our court aboundedwas one Joe Traill who had been in prison many a time for petty larcenyand the like. He was one of those who stink in the nostrils of cleanlycivilised society and who are its shame and secret sore. There was noplace for Joe in this great world of ours. He said to Joshua one nightin his blithe way that there was nothing for him but to make a runningfight for it now up now down as his luck went."Burglary's a bad trade" said Joshua."Only one I've got at my fingers' ends governor" laughed the thief"and starvation is a worse go than quod.""Well till you've learned a better share with us" said Joshua. So nowwe had a reformed burglar and a reformed prostitute in our littlecircle."It is what Christ would have done" said Joshua when he wasremonstrated with.But the police did not see it. Wherefore "from information received"Joshua and I were called up before the master and had our dismissalfrom the shop and we found ourselves penniless in the wilds of London.But Joshua was undisturbed. He told both Joe and Mary that he would notforsake them come what might.It was a hard time and bit by bit everything we possessed passed overthe pawnbroker's counter even to our tools. But when we were at theworst Joshua received a letter enclosing a five-pound note "from afriend." We never knew where it came from and there was no clue bywhich we could guess. Immediately after both Joshua and I got a job andJoe and Mary still bided with us.Joshua's life of work and endeavour brought with it no reward of praiseor popularity. It suffered the fate of all unsectarianism and made himto be as one man in the midst of foes. He soon began to see that theutmost he could do was only palliative and temporary. So he turned toclass organisation as something more hopeful than private charity. Whenthe International Workingmen's Association was formed he joined it asone of its first members indeed he mainly helped to establish it. Andthough he never got the ear of the International because he was sotruly liberal he had some little influence and what influence he hadennobled their councils as they have never been ennobled since.One evening Joe Traill who had been given a situation came into thenight school staggering drunk and made a commotion and though Joshuaquieted him after being struck by him the police attracted by thetumult came up into the room and marched Joshua and myself off to thepolice station where we were locked up for the night. As we had to bepunished reason or none we were both sent to prison for a couple of
comment993,weeks next morning.Well Christ was the criminal of his daySuch backslidings and failures at that of Joe Traill were among thegreatest difficulties of Joshua's work. Men and women whom he hadthought he had cleansed and set on a wholesome way of living turnedback again to the drink and the deviltry of their lives and the varioussectarians who came along all agreed that the cause of his failureswas--Joshua was not a ChristianNext a spasmodic philanthropist Lord X. struck up a friendship withJoshua who he said wanted as a background a man of position. Thisled to Joshua's first introduction into a wealthy house of the upperclasses and the luxury and lavishness almost stupefied him. Lady X.liked Joshua and felt he was a master-spirit but when she came toChurch Court and found out what Mary had been she went away offendedand we saw her no more._IV.--The Pathway of Martyrdom_Sometimes Joshua went as a lecturer to various towns for his politicalassociates were willing to use his political zeal though they did notgo in for his religious views. He insisted on the need of the workingclasses raising themselves to a higher level in mind and circumstanceand on the right of each man to a fair share of the primary essentialsfor good living. His discourses roused immense antagonism and he wassometimes set upon and severely handled by the men to whom he spoke. Ihave known swindlers and murderers more gently entreated. When afterthe war between France and Prussia the Commune declared itself in ParisJoshua went over to help as far as he could in the cause of humanity.I went with him and poor loving faithful Mary followed us. But therenotwithstanding all that we and others of like mind could do blood wasshed which covered liberty with shame and in the confusion thatfollowed Mary was shot as a ptroleuse while she was succouring thewounded. We buried her tenderly and I laid part of my life in hergrave.On our return Joshua was regarded as the representative of socialdestruction and godless licence for the very name of the Commune was ared rag to English thought.At last we came to a place called Lowbridge where Joshua was announcedto lecture on Communism in the town hall. Grave as he always was thatnight he was grave to sadness like a martyr going to his death. Heshook hands with me before going on the platform and said "God blessyou John you have been a true friend to me."In the first row in front of him was the former clergyman of TrevalgaMr. Grand who had lately been given the rich living of Lowbridge andone or two stately cathedral appointments. At the first word Joshuaspoke there broke out such a tumult as I had never heard in any publicmeeting. The yells hisses cat-calls whoopings were indescribable. Itonly ceased when Mr. Grand rose and standing on a chair appealed tothe audience to "Give him your minds my men and let him understandthat Lowbridge is no place for a godless rascal like him."I will do Mr. Grand the justice to say I do not think he intended hiswords to have the effect they did have. A dozen men leaped on theplatform and in a moment I saw Joshua under their feet. They had it alltheir own way and while he lay on the ground pale and senseless onewith a fearful oath kicked him twice on the head. Suddenly a whisperwent round they all drew a little way off the gas was turned downand the place cleared as if by magic. When the lights were up again Iwent to lift him--and he was dead.The man who had lived the life after Christ more exactly than any humanbeing ever known to me was killed by the Christian party of order. Sothe world has ever disowned its best when they came.The death of my friend has left me not only desolate but uncertain. LikeJoshua in earlier days my mind is unpiloted and unanchored. EverywhereI see the sifting of competition and nowhere Christian protection of
comment994,weakness everywhere dogma adored and nowhere Christ realised. Andagain I ask Which is true--modern society in its class strife andconsequent elimination of its weaker elements or the brotherhood andcommunism taught by the Jewish Carpenter of Nazareth Who will answerme Who will make the dark thing clear                                   SAMUEL LOVERHandy Andy     Samuel Lover born at Dublin on February 24 1797 was the     most versatile man of his age. He was a song-writer a     novelist a painter a dramatist and an entertainer and in     each of these parts he was remarkably successful. In 1835 he     came to London and set up as a miniature painter then he     turned to literature and in "Rory O'More" published in 1837     and "Handy Andy a Tale of Irish Life" which appeared in     1842 he took the town. Lover was a typical Irishman of the     old school--high-spirited witty and jovially humorous and     his work is informed with a genuine Irish raciness that gives     it a perennial freshness. He is a man gaily in love with life     and with a quick eye for all the varied humours of it. "Handy     Andy" is one of the most amusing books ever written a roaring     farce written by a man who combined the liveliest sense of     fun with a painter's gift of portraying real character in a     few vivid touches. Samuel Lover died on July 6 1868._I.--The Squire Gets a Surprise_Andy Rooney was a fellow with a most ingenious knack of doing everythingthe wrong way. "Handy" Andy was the nickname the neighbours stuck onhim and the poor simple-minded lad liked the jeering jingle. Even Mrs.Rooney who thought that her boy was "the sweetest craythur the cunshines on" preferred to hear him called "Handy Andy" rather than"Suds."For sad memories attached to the latter nickname. Knowing what a hardlife Mrs. Rooney had had--she had married a stranger who disappeared amonth after marriage so Andy came into the world with no father to beata little sense into him--Squire Egan of Merryvale engaged the boy as aservant. One of the first things that Andy was called upon to do was towait at table during an important political dinner given by the squire.Andy was told to ice the champagne and the wine and a tub of ice weregiven to him."Well this is the quarest thing I ever heered of" said Andy. "MushaWhat outlandish inventions the quality has among them They're notcontent with wine but they must have ice along with it--and in a tubtoo like pigs Troth its a' dirty thrick I think. But here goes"
comment995,said he and opening a bottle of champagne he poured it into the tubwith the ice.Andy distinguished himself right at the beginning of the dinner. One ofthe guests asked him for soda-water."Would you like it hot or cold sir" he said."Never mind" replied the guest with a laugh. But Andy was anxious toplease and the squire's butler met him hurrying to the kitchenbewildered but still resolute."One of the gintlemen wants some soap and wather with his wine"exclaimed Andy. "Shall I give it hot or cold"The distracted and irate butler took Andy to the sideboard and pushed asmall soda into his hand saying "Cut the cord you fool" Andy took itgingerly and holding it over the table carried out the order. Bang Iwent the bottle and the cork after knocking out two of the lightsstruck the squire in the eye while the hostess had a cold bath down herback. Poor Andy frightened by the soda-water jumping out of the bottlekept holding it out at arm's-length exclaiming at every fizz "Ow owow""Send that fellow out of the room" said the squire to the butler "andbring in the champagne."In staggered Andy with the tub."Hand it round the table" said the squire.Andy tried to lift up the tub "to hand it round the table" but findinghe could not he whispered "I can't get it up sir""Draw it then" murmured his master thinking that Andy meant he had gota bottle which was not effervescent enough to expel its own cork."Here it is" said Andy pulling the tub up to the squire's chair."What do you mean you stupid rascal" exclaimed the squire staring atthe strange stuff before him. "There's not a single bottle there""To be sure there's no bottle there sir" said Andy. "I've poured everydhrop of wine in the ice as you towld me sir. If you put your handdown into it you'll feel it."A wild roar of laughter uprose from the listening guests. Happily theywere now too merry to be upset by the mishap and it was generally votedthat the joke was worth twice as much as the wine. Handy Andy washowever expelled from the dining-room in disgrace and for days keptout of his master's way and the servants for months would call him byno other name but "Suds."_II.--O'Grady Gets a Blister_Mr. Egan was a kind-hearted man and instead of dismissing Andy hekept him on for out-door work. Our hero at once distinguished himself inhis new walk of life."Ride into the town and see if there is a letter for me" said thesquire."I want a letther if you plaze" shouted Andy rushing into thepost-office."Who do you want it for" asked the postmaster."What consarn is that o' yours" exclaimed Andy.Happily a man who knew Andy looked in for a letter paid the postage offourpence on it and then settled the dispute between Andy and the
comment996,postmaster by mentioning Mr. Egan's name."Why didn't you tell me you came from the squire" said the postmaster."Here's a letter for him. Elevenpence postage.""Elevenpence postage" Andy cried. "Didn't I see you give that man aletther for fourpence and a bigger letther than this Do you think I'ma fool""No" said the postmaster "I'm sure of it."He walked off to serve another customer and Andy meditated. His masterwanted the letter badly so he would have to pay the exorbitant price.He snatched two other letters from the heap on the counter while thepostmaster's back was turned paid the elevenpence received the epistleto which he was entitled and rode home triumphant."Look at that" he exclaimed slapping the three letters down under hisbroad fist on the table before the astonished squire. "He made me payelevenpence by gor But I've brought your honour the worth of yourmoney anyhow.""Well by the powers" said the squire as Andy stalked out of the roomwith an air of supreme triumph. "That's the most extraordinary genius Iever came across"He read the letter for which he had been anxiously waiting. It was fromhis lawyer about the forthcoming election. In it he was warned to bewareof his friend O'Grady who was selling his interest to the governmentcandidate."So that's the work O'Grady's at" exclaimed the squire angrily. "Foulfoul And after all the money I lent him too"He threw down the letter and his eye caught the other two that Andy hadstolen."More of that mad fool's work Robbing the mail now. That's a hangingjob. I'd better send them to the parties to whom they're addressed."Picking up one of the epistles he found it was a government letterdirected to his new enemy O'Grady. "All's fair in war" thought thesquire and pinching the letter until it gaped he peeped in and read"As you very properly remark poor Egan is a spoon--a mere spoon." "Am Ia spoon your villain" roared the squire tearing the letter andthrowing it into the fire. "I'm a spoon you'll sup sorrow with yet""Get out a writ on O'Grady for all the money he owes me" he wrote tohis lawyer. "Send me the blister and I'll slap it on him."Unfortunately he sent Andy with this letter still more unfortunatelyMrs. Egan also gave the simple fellow a prescription to be made up atthe chemist's. Andy surpassed himself on this occasion. He called at thechemist's on his way back from the lawyer's and carefully laid thesealed envelope containing the writ on the counter while he was gettingthe medicine. On leaving he took up a different envelope."My dear Squire" ran the letter Andy brought back "I send you the
comment997,blister for O'Grady as you insist on it but I don't think you willfind it easy to serve him with it.--Your obedient MURTOUGH MURPHY."When the squire opened the accompanying envelope and found within areal instead of a figurative blister he grew crimson with rage. But hewas consoled when he went to horsewhip his attorney and met the chemistpelting down the street with O'Grady tearing after him with a cudgel.For some years O'Grady had successfully kept out of his door everyprocess-server sent by his innumerable creditors but now having got acold he had dispatched his man to the chemist for a blister and owingto Handy Andy he obtained Squire Egan's writ against him."You've made a mistake this time you rascal" said the squire to Andy"for which I'll forgive you."And this was only fair for through it he was able to carry theelection and become Edward Egan Esq. M.P._III.--Andy Gets Married_Andy was among the guests invited to the wedding feast of pretty MattyDwyer and handsome young James Casey like everybody else he came to themarriage full of curiosity. Matty's father John Dwyer was a hardclose-fisted fellow and as all the neighbours knew there had beenmany fierce disputes between him and Casey over the question of a farmbelonging to Dwyer going into the marriage settlement.A grand dinner was laid in the large barn but it was kept waiting owingto the absence of the bridegroom. Father Phil the kindly jovial parishpriest who had come to help James and Matty "tie with their tongues theknot they couldn't undo with their teeth" had not broken his fast thatday and wanted the feast to go on. To the great surprise of thecompany Matty backed him and full of life and spirits began to laythe dinner. For some time the hungry guests were busy with the goodcheer provided for them but the women at last asked in loud whispers"Where in the world is James Casey" Still the bride kept up her smilesbut old Jack Dwyer's face grew blacker and blacker. Unable to bear thestrain any longer he stood up and addressed the expectant crowd."You see the disgrace that's put on me""He'll come yet sir" said Andy."No he won't" cried Dwyer "I see he won't. He wanted to geteverything his own way and he thinks to disgrace me in doing what helikes but he shan't" and he struck the table fiercely. "He goes backof his bargain now thinkin' I'll give in to him but I won't. Friendsand neighbours here's the lease of the three-cornered field below thereand a snug little cottage and it's ready for my girl to walk in withthe man that will have her If there's a man among you here that'swilling let him say the word and I'll give her to him"Matty tried to protest but her father silenced her with a terriblelook. When old Dwyer's blood was up he was capable of murder. No guestdared to speak."Are yiz all dumb" shouted Dwyer. "It's not every day a farm and a finegirl falls in a man's way."Still no one spoke and Andy thought they were using Dwyer and hisdaughter badly."Would I do sir" he timidly said.Andy was just the last man Dwyer would have chosen but he wasdetermined that someone should marry the girl and show Casey "thedisgrace should not be put on him." He called up Andy and Matty andasked the priest to marry them."I can't if your daughter objects" said Father Phil.Dwyer turned on the girl and there was the devil in his eye.
comment998,"I'll marry him" said Matty.So the rites and blessings of the Church were dispensed between twopersons who an hour before had never given a thought to each other. Yetit was wonderful with what lightness of heart Matty went through thehonours consequent on a peasant bridal in Ireland. She gaily led off thedance with Andy and the night was far spent before the bride andbridegroom were escorted to the cottage which was to be their home.Matty sat quiet looking at the fire while Andy bolted the door butwhen he tried to kiss her she leaped up furiously."I'll crack your silly head if you don't behave yourself" she criedseizing a stool and brandishing it above him."Oh wirra wirra" said Andy. "Aren't you my wife Why did you marryme""Did I want owld Jack Dwyer to murther me as soon as the people's backswas turned" said Matty. "But though I'm afraid of him I'm not afraidof you""Och" cried poor Andy "what'll be the end of it"There was a tap at the door as he spoke and Matty ran and opened it.In came James Casey and half a dozen strong young fellows. Behind themcrept a reprobate degraded priest who got his living and his name of"Couple-Beggar" by performing irregular marriages. The end of it wasthat Matty was married over again to Casey whom she had sent for whilethe dancing was going on. Poor Andy bound hand and foot was carriedout of the cottage to a lonely by-way and there he passed hiswedding-night roped to the stump of an old tree._IV.--Andy Gets Married Again_Misfortunes now accumulated on Andy's head. At break of day he wasreleased from the tree-stump by Squire Egan who was riding by with somebad news for the man he thought was now a happy bridegroom. Owing to anindiscreet word dropped by our simple-minded hero a gang of smugglerswho ran an illicit still on the moors had gathered something about Andystealing the letters from the post-office and Squire Egan burning them.They had already begun to blackmail the squire and in order to defeatthem it was necessary to get Andy out of the country for some time. Sonothing could be done against Casey.And on going home to prepare for a journey to England with a friend ofthe squire's Andy found his mother in a sad state of anxiety. Hispretty cousin Oonah was crying in a corner of the room and RaggedNance an unkempt beggar-woman to whom the Rooneys had done many a goodturn was screaming "I tell you Shan More means to carry off Oonahto-night. I heard them laying the plan for it.""We'll go to the squire" sobbed Mrs. Rooney. "The villain durst not""He's got the squire under his thumb I tell you" replied Ragged Nance."You must look after yourselves. I've got it" she said turning toAndy. "We'll dress him as a girl and let the smugglers take him."Andy roared with laughter at the notion of being made a girl of. ThoughShan More was the blackguardly leader of the smugglers who were givingthe squire trouble Andy was too taken up with the fun of beingtransformed into the very rough likeness of a pleasing young woman tothink of the danger. It was difficult to give his angular form thenecessary roundness of outline but Ragged Nance at last padded him outwith straw and tied a bonnet on his head to shade his face saying"That'll deceive them. Shan More won't come himself. He'll send some ofhis men and they're all dhrunk already.""But they'll murdher my boy when they find out the chate" said Mrs.Rooney."Suppose they did" exclaimed Andy stoutly "I'd rather die sure thanthe disgrace should fall upon Oonah there.""God bless you Andy dear" said Oonah.The tramp of approaching horses rang through the stillness of the nightand Oonah and Nance ran out and crouched in the potato tops in thegarden. Four drunken vagabonds broke into the cottage and seeing Andyin the dim light clinging to his mother they dragged him away andlifted him on a horse and galloped off with him.
comment999,As it happened luck favoured Andy. When he came to the smugglers' denShan More was lying on the ground stunned and his sister Red Bridgetwas tending him in going up the ladder from the undergroundwhisky-still he had fallen backward. The upshot was that Andy was leftin charge of Red Bridget. But alas just as he was hoping to escapeshe penetrated through his disguise. More unfortunately still Andy waswith all his faults a rather good-looking young fellow and Red Bridgettook a fancy to him and the "Couple-Beggar" was waiting for a job.Smugglers' whisky is very strong and Bridget artfully plied him withit. Andy was still rather dazed when he reached home next morning."I've married again" he said to his mother."Married" interrupted Oonah growing pale. "Who to""Shan More's sister" said Andy."Wirasthru" screamed Mrs. Rooney tearing her cap off her head. "Yougot the worst woman in Ireland.""Then I'll go and 'list for a sojer" said he._V.--Andy Gets Married a Third Time_It was Father Phil that brought the extraordinary news to Squire Egan."Do you remember those two letters that Andy stole from the post-officeand that someone burnt" he asked with a smile."I've been meaning to tell you father that one was for you" said thesquire looking very uncomfortable."Oh Andy let it out long ago" said the kindly old priest. "But thejoke is that by stealing my letter Andy nearly lost a title and a greatfortune. Ever heard of Lord Scatterbrain He died a little time agoconfessing in his will that it was he that married Mrs. Rooney anddeserted her.""So Handy Andy is now a lord" exclaimed the squire rocking withlaughter.Andy took it like a true son of the wildest and most eccentric of Irishpeers. On getting over the first shock of astonishment he broke outinto short peals of laughter exclaiming at intervals that "it wasmighty quare." When after much questioning his wishes in regard to hisnew life were made clear it was found that they all centred on oneobject which was "to have a goold watch."The squire was perplexed what to do with a great nobleman of this sortand at last he got a kinsman Dick Dawson who loved fun to take Andyunder his especial care to London. When they arrived there it waswonderful how many persons were eager to show civility to his newlordship and he who as Handy Andy had been cried down all his life as a"stupid rascal" "a blundering thief" "a thick-headed brute" suddenlyacquired under the title of Lord Scatterbrain a reputation for being"vastly amusing a little eccentric perhaps but so droll."All this was very delightful for Andy--so delightful that he quiteforgot Red Bridget. But Red Bridget did not forget him."Lady Scatterbrain" announced the servant one day and in came Bridgetand Shan More and an attorney.The attorney brought out a settlement in which an exorbitant sum was tobe settled on Bridget and Shan More with a threatening air orderedAndy to sign the deed."I can't" cried Andy retreating to the fire-place "and I won't""You must sign your name" roared Shan More."I can't I tell you" yelled Andy seizing the poker. "I've neverlarned to write.""Your lordship can make your mark" said the attorney."I'll make my mark with this poker" cried Andy "if you don't all clearout"The noise of a frightful row brought Dick Dawson into the room and hemanaged to get rid of the intruders by inducing the attorney to conductthe negotiations through Lord Scatterbrain's solicitors.But while the negotiations were going on a fact came to light that
comment1000,altered the whole complexion of the matter and Andy went post-hasteover to Ireland to the fine house in which his mother and his cousinwere living.Bursting into the drawing-room he made a rush upon Oonah whom hehugged and kissed most outrageously with exclamations of the wildestaffection.When Oonah freed herself from his embraces and asked him what he wasabout Andy turned over the chairs threw the mantelpiece ornaments intothe fire and banged the poker and tongs together shouting "HurrooI'm not married at all"It had been discovered that Red Bridget had a husband living when sheforced Andy to marry her and as soon as it was legally proved that LordScatterbrain was a free man Father Phil was called in and Oonah whohad all along loved her wild cousin was made Lady Scatterbrain.                                   EDWARD BULWER LYTTONEugene Aram     Novelist poet essayist and politician Edward Bulwer Lytton     was born in London on May 25 1805. His father was General     Earle Bulwer. He assumed his mother's family name on her death     in 1843 and was elevated to the peerage as Baron Lytton in     1866. At seventeen Lytton published a volume entitled     "Ismael and Other Poems." An unhappy marriage in 1827 was     followed by extraordinary literary activity and during the     next ten years he produced twelve novels two poems a play     "England and the English" and "Athens Its Rise and Fall"     besides an enormous number of shorter stories essays and     articles for contemporary periodicals. Altogether his output     is represented by nearly sixty volumes. Few books on their     publication have created a greater furore than Lord Lytton's     "Eugene Aram" which was published in 1832. One section of the     novel-reading public hailed its moving dramatic story with     manifest delight while the other severely condemned it on the     plea of its false morality. The story takes its title from     that remarkable scholar and criminal Eugene Aram at one time     a tutor in the Lytton family who was executed at York in     1759 for a murder committed fourteen years before. The crime     caused much consternation at the time Aram's refined and mild     disposition being apparently in direct contradiction to his     real nature. The novel is an unusually successful though     perhaps one-sided psychological study. In a revised edition     Lytton made the narrative agree with his own conclusion that     though an accomplice in robbery Aram was not guilty of     premeditated or actual murder. Edward Bulwer Lytton died on     January 18 1873._I.--At the Sign of the Spotted Dog_In the county of ---- was a sequestered hamlet to which I shall givethe name of Grassdale. It lay in a fruitful valley between gentle andfertile hills. Its single hostelry the Spotted Dog was owned by onePeter Dealtry a small farmer who was also clerk of the parish. Onsummer evenings Peter was frequently to be seen outside his inndiscussing psalmody and other matters with Jacob Bunting late acorporal in his majesty's army a man who prided himself on hisknowledge of the world and found Peter's too easy fund of merrimentoccasionally irritating.On one such evening their discussion was interrupted by anunprepossessing and travel-stained stranger who when his wants nonetoo amiably expressed had been attended to exhibited a markedcuriosity concerning the people of the locality. As the stranger paidfor his welcome with a liberal hand Peter became more than usuallycommunicative.He described the lord of the manor a distinguished nobleman who livedat the castle some six miles away. He talked of the squire and hishousehold. "But" he continued "the most noticeable man is a greatscholar. There yonder" said he "you may just catch a glimpse of thetall what-d'ye-call-it he has built on the top of his house that he may
